SR: I want to make a comment about the Hammond situation in Oregon, something I don’t think most folks understand is that the Hammond family has declined help. In fact, they’re making it clear that they do not want any kind of standoff with the feds, and they do not want to prevent themselves from going and serving their sentence out. They intend to turn themselves in and serve out the remainder of their sentence. This has been made clear by their own attorney. He’s also made it very clear that Ammon Bundy doesn’t speak for them. This has to be said because unfortunately Ammon hasn’t made that clear. He put out a statement in the last couple days calling for people to go there and defend the family. He says here I’m asking you now to come to Burns and defend this family and defend this county. He’s not making it clear that the Hammond family does not want that done. What they want is to turn themselves in and go serve their sentence.

SR: (0:00:57.5) It’d be much like in the Kim Davis situation. We offered her our assistance, our protection against the US Marshals being able to arrest her again under contempt orders from the court. We thought that was illegitimate. We offered our protection and were willing to go there with rifles in hand to stop them. But she declined our offer through her attorneys, she let it be known she did not want our help. So we stood down and went home. We do not have the right to force ourselves on people who do not want our help. That’s ground zero on this. They have not asked for our help. Quite the contrary, they’ve let it be known that they want to turn themselves in and serve out their sentence. So we have no right, none of us do, no patriot has any right to force a confrontation around that family when they don’t want it. To me, that’s a no brainer and should be the end of the discussion. Now beyond that there are some very serious differences in this case and at Bundy Ranch. We went to Bundy Ranch to prevent that family from being Waco’d. We were concerned by the behavior of the feds, with their special forces contractors and their known sniper teams they were deploying against cowboys, and the free speech zone they set up. All that kind of abuse that was right there in front of us on camera. We were concerned that this family was about to be Waco’d. It was a very righteous thing to go down there and prevent that. That was our full justification for what we did, to go there and prevent mass murder of this family. I think that was righteous and I’m glad we did it. Even though there were some problems that came out of that, it was worth it. This situation, there is no threat of the family being murdered. There has already been a jury trial, they were found guilty by a jury of their peers. And you don’t have local support. In fact, locals are now standing up saying they don’t want anybody from outside coming in and interfering, and the family themselves don’t want the help. So this is exactly the opposite of Bundy Ranch. You’ve got a situation where you have people who don’t want this, and you’ve got outsiders trying to force it on them. I think we need to stay out of it. If it’s only a matter of peaceful protest, of course that would be fine. That’s righteous and good to go. But you cannot go there and force a confrontation with rifles in hand on a family does not want the assistance. I think OK needs to stay the hell out of it, aside from the peaceful protest. That’s not what I see developing.

SR: (0:03:18.7) In Ammon’s own video statement, he talks about calling on those who went to Bundy Ranch to go there to Oregon and take a stand in defense of the family. That does not sound like a peaceful protest, that sounds like an armed confrontation. Ammon needs to be clear about what he wants so people know what they’re getting themselves into. So far, he has not been clear. OK will not be involved in an armed standoff that’s being manufactured by hot-heads who want a fight. This is going to be a bad fight, not a righteous moral high ground fight. Stay out of it.

SR: (0:03:54.6) Now I’ve got a couple other people here who were at Bundy Ranch. We’ve got Todd from Idaho, Rick from Montana, and John who was at the White Hope Mine in Lincoln Montana. Todd do you want to say your peace?

Todd: I’m in full support of a peaceful protest. I think what’s happening to the Hammonds is a travesty. I think the BLM have overstepped their bounds once again in this matter. But we do have a precedent. There has been a jury trial. They’ve served time for that. I believe it’s a travesty to send them back to prison again. I’m in full support of a peaceful protest, but I do have some concerns that this may be manufactured, and may be heading towards more than just a peaceful protest. What I saw in the situation with the Bundy Ranch, as I saw it unfold. My friends and I performed our due diligence on that situation and we came to a conclusion that the BLM was acting completely inappropriate and tyrannical. Throwing a woman to the ground, tazering Ammon, siccing an attack dog on home, pointing sniper rifles at cowboys, arresting one of the Bundy sons. Obviously, that was tyranny right on our computer screens. We got to see that. My line in the sand for Bundy Ranch was when I saw the 1A area. That was a complete red flag, complete abrogation of the Constitution. At that point, I loaded my gear and went there to defend, not just the Bundy Ranch or the Bundys. The Bundys aside, to me it was about the Constitution. Concerning this issue, I’ve not seen travesties, other than the BLM burning some of that grassland out there, which some of those people should be put in jail for burning down houses and killing cattle. That needs to be handled in a separate way. But the Hammonds have not asked for our assistance. The community has not asked for our assistance. The US Attorney has stated that if there is any interference with the apprehension of the Hammonds, that it will be handled probably violently. I’m in full support of the Hammonds. I think this is a complete travesty. But I do not feel that this is another Bundy Ranch, or Bundy 2 as some people are calling it. Due to the fact that there was a jury of his peers, and they are not asking for our help. They have subjected themselves to the authorities and are saying that they are going to serve out their sentence. So who am I to interject myself into it, other than a peaceful protest, which I’m in full agreement that a protest is fine. But anything more than a peaceful protest, if there are any weapons brought out, I see that we could have, we being the patriot community, could have some serious repercussions. Some friends of mine have stated that the federal government will not continue to lose every time. If there is an escalation of force, this will be the perfect excuse to stamp it out. Once again, I think it’s a travesty. But I’ve been to the Sugar Pine Mine, the White Hope Mine, and I stood the gap for an old Army veteran, they were trying to take his guns from him because they felt he was incompetent for handling his own affairs. I stood in the gap for those people because they asked me to be there, and they wanted me there armed. These folks aren’t even asking for a peaceful protest. We’re putting together a peaceful protest on our own. And I pray that it stays peaceful and that this thing goes off without a hitch. But I have some serious concerns with some of the people that are on the ground that are actively pushing for an armed confrontation. I pray that cooler heads will prevail in this situation and that this will turn out to be just a peaceful protest and nothing more. Gentlemen, whoever’s listening to this, please handle this with kid gloves because, from my contacts, it looks like there may be some hotheads or provocateurs that may want more than just a peaceful protest. I’m in full support of the Hammonds and everybody on the ground there, as long as it’s a peaceful protest. I hope it ends up. Good luck, I’d be there if I could. But I have some concerns.

SR: (0:09:14.6) Thanks Todd. Rick, go ahead.

Rick: What Todd said is exactly my same feelings. I can’t add to that or anything. He brought up all the points that I would want to bring up also.

SR: Thanks Rick. Any comments on the situation here with the Hammonds?

Rick: That’s a losing situation. If I was a III% or an OK, I would stay completely away from that situation. I would not have anything to do with it. I would not show up there with arms or anything else.   SR: Let’s go to John now. John any comments on the Hammond situation?

John: Much like my friends have already said, I don’t like what’s happened to them. I do think it’s an injustice. Without them asking, and they’ve made it clear that they don’t want any assistance, so without them asking, I don’t see what we can do for them. I agree with a peaceful protest. But as far as showing up armed, I think it’s a bad idea. I think bad things are going to come from it. Until this family asks for help, or until anybody for that matter asks for help, who are we to interject ourselves into this situation? At White Hope we were asked to help, we went there, we realized very quickly that we didn’t need to have a ton of armed guys there and we de-escalated. We did not make the situation worse. We helped the miners out and we would have been happy to do this for this family too, but they don’t want our help. Again, who are we to put ourselves in there and say no, we’re going to help you whether you like it or not. I pray like Todd that people keep cool heads and do just what they say they’re going to do, which is a peaceful protest, which I’m 100% behind. But until someone asks for our help, I don’t think we have the right to be there.

SR: (0:11:29.4) Right, just like the guys in, hell the Bundys asked for our help and we went. The Sugar Pine Mine miners went to a public meeting of OK in Josephine County and requested in person, requested help and we helped them. The folks in Ferguson, we went and asked them if they wanted our protection and they said yes, but if they’d have said no, we could not force ourselves onto their rooftops and protect them anyway, same situation here. Just like with Kim Davis, when she said no, we had no choice but to stand down. I think it’s the same situation here. Thank you guys for your input. Any closing comments on this, John? One thing Mike Vanderboegh said in the wake of Bundy Ranch, he said when you play brinkmanship, eventually one of them’s going to go hot. You can expect that eventually the fight’s going to come to us. But how it comes to us matters. I encourage everyone listening, go back and look at the Founders as your example of how to do it right. If you’re going to have a fight, let it be like Concord and Lexington, where they forced Gage to come after them out in the countryside, to be the clear aggressor, where he was weak and they were strong. So they had a moral high ground, a moral victory, then they kicked his ass all the way back to Boston, so they had a military victory also. You don’t start off with having the bad guys having the perceived moral high ground. And who’s your audience? Your fellow American patriot, especially the guys in current service in the military. What they think matters. At Bundy Ranch, we had the clear moral high ground. As Todd has already pointed out. If there had been a firefight on that day, at least half the military would have sided with us. Guarantee it, they would have sided with us. This is a different situation. Here, it’s perceived as outsiders forcing the confrontation on a family that doesn’t want it and forcing themselves into a community that does not want them there. And going against the jury’s verdict will be perceived as having the least amount of legitimacy you can possibly imagine. You’d end up with a moral defeat, and probably a physical defeat as well, cause you can bet the feds are gonna have sniper teams deployed wherever the Hammonds are turning themselves in. So anybody who’s thinking they’re going to cause the 2nd American Revolution, kicking it off here in this situation in Oregon, you need to take a good hard look at what the Founders did and the way to do it right and the way to do it wrong. You need to make sure you have the moral high ground. And don’t worry, the fight’s coming to you eventually. Let it come to you on your terms, where they are the aggressors, not you being the aggressor and forcing the fight. Thanks guys. Look people, men on the phone here are guys who have shown up. These are not people that just talk and don’t walk their talk. They show up. So take it from them. These are people who are serious. Alright guys. God bless you and thank you for your service to your country and our cause. We hope people will listen and cooler heads will prevail. Like I said, I didn’t want to make this recording, the last thing I want to do is criticize the work of other good people. I think Ammon is a good man. I think he needs to be real clear and honest about what he’s doing. If he wants an armed confrontation, he should just say it. But he should also make it clear that the family does not want that, he’s going against their wishes. I think he’s wrong in doing that, I hate to say it. He’s a good man.

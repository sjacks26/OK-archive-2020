<content:encoded>The comment was ” There is nothing in Article V that says it is to be used to limit the power and jurisdiction of the federal government. And that CONGRESS WILL DECIDE ON THE MODE OF RATIFICATION….. Three things you wrong about. First: The framers could not foresee what  amendments, if an, would b needed. Therefor, Article V does not say what amendments could be submitted. It only requires that 34 states submit application for the same purpose “Limiting the power and scope of the Federal Government”.  Second: The state legislators decide how many delegates to send and chooses the delegates. Regardless of the number of delegates they send, it one state, one vote. Once the 34 state threshold has been made, Congress will be notified and they have only three responsibilities. 1) Set the location, 2) Set he time and 3) Choose one of the two methods for ratification. By the state legislature or by the popular vote of the citizen of that state. That’s it. I don’t see where you are getting that Congress is actually getting more power.

<content:encoded>We NEED a convention, congress has proven time and again, the WILL NOT rescind any of there powers!! This is the only way to reign them in. No matter what is decided in a convention, it has to be ratified by the states to become valid, another check and balance!!!! Hooray for the founding fathers and there wisdom!!!

<content:encoded>You should take your own advice.  If you had done any research whatsoever, then perhaps you could have presented some semblance of a real argument.  What you written is not an argument, only baseless and foolish opinion backed by nothing.

<content:encoded>I was honored to be a member of Oathkeepers. If this article represents the views of the Oathkeepers values. I feel it contradicts the Oath too to protect and defend the Constitution of the United States. I also feel is contradicts the slogan and values of your group. 
<p>This article mirror’s the campaign of lies, egnorence fear mongering as the John Birch Society.</p>
<p>The  Oathkeepers was a organization that supported the people when injustices of the government effected them. Now it seems to more about propaganda and image. You should do more research on the topics before you promote false image of the Constitution.</p>

<content:encoded>Anytime you add or subtract an amendment, the Constitution is rewritten. That is not a valid argument in your favor.<br/>
The point is, the Article V convention gives the left the vehicle they need to throw out the entire document.

<content:encoded>You think it is courageous to let the door be opened to throwing out our Constitution?<br/>
I am tired of your side throwing out the “fear” and “fearmongering” name calling.

<content:encoded>I am an Honorably discharged Vet. A member of my family has been serving in the US Military for the past 75 yrs or more. It’s sad to see what these politicians have turned America into. The Media is in bed with the Govn’mt so don’t expect anyone to tell you the truth. They are so scared every Media station and both Dems and Rep a like are taking shots at Trump just to try and keep things the way they have been for way to long. I don’t see why we can’t organize “All Veterans and have a major voice”. We need to stand up and let the Politicians know enough is enough and were going to be putting who we want in office. We just need that person who can start the movement. You not only have the power of Votes of the Veterans but of their families. We need to organize and take back America at the polls.

<content:encoded>TJ – as you suggested, I went to MAOK on facebook and left my information in a post. Don’t know if this was the correct thing to do or not.

<content:encoded>I am not a military vet or a retired police officer, just a citizen of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Am I able to join? Thanks for your time.

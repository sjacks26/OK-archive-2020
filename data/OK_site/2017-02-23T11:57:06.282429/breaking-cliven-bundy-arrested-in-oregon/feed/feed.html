<content:encoded>The Bundy’s stood up for their own land and that was a just cause to pay grazing fees to the federal government for what the federal goverment has no right to this land since the federal government is not suppose to own any land. Why would you pay rent to someone that doesn’t own the property. That would be like if I went to someone’s house and knocked on the door and demanded rent money and they said you don’t own this house and I just claimed yes I do and if you don’t pay me rent I will bring in armed thugs and remove you.the American people have the belief that the federal government can own land and that is false all land in the USA is public owned land or private owned land. The Bundy’s more than likely got lured into a trap in Oregon, malitia’s had probably been infilatrated with undercover agents who probably asked the Bundy’s to join this Oregon standoff not knowing they were walking into a trap. Numerous patriot movement head told them they were being set up they should have known when to walk away and they could have flown back to Oregon later and held town hall meetings with local sheriffs and informed people and gathered support these armed standoffs are not the way townhall meeting all over the country and inform people about the Constitution make the understand that the federal government has no rights to own land and realize the American people have been brainwashed for decades and you have to break through the brainwashing.

<content:encoded>Hey 11bCib, it’s good to hear from you.<br/>
Are you feeling much better now? Well, probably not just yet. I figure it will probably take a couple more posts before you finally get the majority of this guilt and anger out of your system. No problem, I’m here. You must be feeling a lot of criticism and or repercussions from those around you for what you think or perceived you should have done. It’s kind of showing itself. My point is, if one signs up to be a fireman, you had better be prepared to go put some fires out, even the really, really bad ones.<br/>
I believe when a militia showed up at the Refuge early on, they were told by the group leaders there, that they did not need their services. I think everyone there at the Refuge should’ve taken notice, at that point in time, that back up or help might not be available in the future. Would I follow that David guy? Well, most likely not. When he started ranting about marijuana and pot or the lack thereof he lost me, and I believe he lost many others too. I still pray for all of them earnestly though.<br/>
You probably couldn’t quite understand or comprehend what my first post meant exactly. It was about LaVoy Finicum in the sacrifice that he made. Did he die in vain? Absolutely not. His death brought life, in some ways the same as Jesus. Many eyes were opened up at that time, as well as mine. Militias are good and people having guns and weapons are good too, but do I think they have a chance in defeating the government of men, at this point in time? They may try, but I believe it will be very ineffective because they are far too powerful. The militias and the people are too divided, in some ways, just like all the Churches even though they all basically believe that Jesus is the Christ the son of the living God. I believe what will defeat the government of men will be the mighty hand of God, not the weapons and armor of mortal men. In the near future, the government of men shall be drastically weakened by financial crisis, natural disasters, social unrest and turmoil within; so much so that they will lose their power and their grip to control the people. It will probably be at that point in time that good people and the people of God will rise up to take their chosen positions, but God shall be in complete control through it all.<br/>
Yes you are correct, we must choose our battles wisely and if you need backup make sure they are available when you need them. Are the militias good? Absolutely yes! Even if they don’t do anything particular, their presence somewhat keeps the powers at be in check. Just knowing that they’re there causes the government of men to be, somewhat cautious in their approach. Unfortunately, through this situation they most likely feel they have the upper hand, but then again, this is only one battle. Eyes have been opened and the people’s hearts have been awakened. Yes, this is the good that’s come out of this even through the tragic death of LaVoy Finicum. A little lightheartedness even when things look dark and desperate isn’t a bad thing. Don’t worry about the criticism and chastisement of other people. Just keep your eyes on God and follow the ways of Truth because evil will be destroyed and Truth and Justice shall prevail in the end.

<content:encoded>I would also like to consider the irony of your statement.  The reason the occupiers thought the American people, oathkeepers, PPN, etc would stand with them is because, like you, they were told real action would follow.  Very few showed up.  Who left them out to dry? 
<p> Every single person that said they would fight for the cause, but did not live up their words, like you.  I give no words, because this is not my cause.  When I do they will be accompanied by action.  That is when you will know the young men stood up while you laid down.  Maybe they will inspire or even shame you into joining them, but let’s be honest, you do not share my value system or those of a true soldier.  </p>
<p>You heard the call as it was put out multiple times…”Follow me!” echoed through the ranks of patriots.  Then David looked behind him and realized he was alone.  You just watched, criticised, gave Stewart advise from a position of ignorance, while he did the work you are unwilling to do.  Wound up, no.  Heartbroken at the fragility of of the American “man’s” commitment, probably.  You make me sad.</p>

<content:encoded>Wow, a little wound up are we. Are you getting a lot slack from people around you that you feel the need to vent? Go ahead just let all that negativity out, then maybe you will feel better. You know you are probably right though. If the young men aren’t up to the task maybe all of us 60, 70 and 80 year olds should get out of our walkers and wheelchairs and head on out. I know, you probably didn’t like the first line about the diapers, but oh well, that’s the way it goes.<br/>
I’m sure you won’t like this either but I found some great information from Bloomberg Business that you might find quite interesting pertaining to my previous comment.<br/>
Check it out, if this website will post the link.<br/>

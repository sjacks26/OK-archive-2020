<content:encoded>I read not long ago that Ike said in so few words that it was wrong to go to war for profit…was after that I gained a a whole new respect for him…..The speech was one of the greatest I ever read.

<content:encoded>Ike warned us of many things, didn’t he?
<p>“We the people” let them all come to pass and destroy our nation didn’t we?</p>
<p>He was in the “know” about many things that was kept secret from us (unlawfully according to our framers). Yet, even he was already so brainwashed that he also referred to our Constitutional Republic as a “democracy”.</p>
<p>He was wrong in how to keep America free. Demolish the standing military, as they are not LAWFUL here in our nation.  All those soldiers who want to be, who are constitutional in nature and NOT Oathbreakers would immediately become paid Militia for their state. Trainers of the people of their state because a Militia in each state is REQUIRED by the US Constitution.</p>
<p>Demolish the governmental professional law enforcement, as they also are NOT lawful here in our nation.  They to, those that uphold the US Constitution become the paid Militia in their state to train the people of their state.</p>
<p>They both would also be needed as PRIVATE INDIVIDUALS, NOT paid governmental individuals, to not only train the people on ALL weapons of war, and tactics.  But to teach the people their LAWFUL duties as peace keepers and to keep the security in their areas. There would need to be those on permanently for awhile to create and inventory weapons, supplies for the militias of each state as they all MUST be ready to defend their state, to defend their nation if needed. </p>
<p>They (Militias) must also ENFORCE THE US CONSTITUTION and each state’s CONSTITUTION while somehow training all those willing to do their duty, collecting whatever state fines from those not willing.  </p>
<p>People of all ages, like those who participate in OK’s Community Preparedness Teams, can teach what they know that would be useful to others in all kinds of catastrophes; first aid, etc. There are all kinds of things that would need to be planned for, and practiced; emergencies, war,  natural disasters, not just crime. Since the general government (federal) is taxed with building post offices and postal roads only – we must also see that we have Americans doing those things to repair our bridges (maybe check them state to state and combine teams to do this?).</p>
<p>Teach in colleges and schools what must be known for when they are active in the militias.  I see decades of paid jobs for those who are supportive of the US Constitution, our nation, our way of life. This can be how we get those AMERICAN industry going – through the Militias since our forefathers and framers – Washington for one – said that we must NEVER depend on those who serve within our governments for supplying the people, the Militias with weapons of war.  Encourage SMALLER businesses in all areas; tech, communications, building, etc that can come from those who serve and did it before.</p>
<p>Remove the traitors and use the buildings, etc, distribute it between many, not one – and NO FAVORITISM to any.  All make it on their own, not by favoritism by those who serve within our governments.</p>
<p>Encourage all to be MADE IN AMERICA.  Our resources for OUR use not foreign corporations, etc.</p>
<p>I see decades of work for those</p>

<p>(b) Oath Keepers shall likewise indemnify each indemnitee who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action or suit by or in the right of Oath Keepers by reason of the fact that such person is or was a trustee, officer, employee or agent of Oath Keepers or is or was serving at the request of Oath Keepers as a director, officer, partner, member, manager, trustor, trustee, beneficiary, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, limited partnership, limited liability company, trust or other entity against amounts paid in settlement and expenses (including attorney fees) actually and reasonably incurred in connection with the defense and/or settlement of the action or suit; so long as such indemnitee acted in good faith and in a manner which such indemnitee reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interest of Oath Keepers.

<p><strong>MISCELLANEOUS</strong></p>
<p><strong>Section 9.01. Construction. </strong>The captions and paragraph numbers appearing in these</p>
<p>Bylaws are inserted only as a matter of convenience and in no way define, limit, construe, or describe the scope or intent of such paragraphs, of these Bylaws nor in any way affect the terms and conditions hereof. The necessary grammatical changes required to make the provisions of these Bylaws apply in a plural or singular sense, where required, or to a particular gender shall, in all instances, be assumed as though in each case fully expressed. Words such as <strong>“herein”</strong>, <strong>“hereof”</strong>, <strong>“hereby”</strong>, and <strong>“hereunder”</strong>, when used in these Bylaws shall refer to these Bylaws as a whole unless a specific provision of these Bylaws is expressly identified. For purposes of these Bylaws, the term <strong>“person” </strong>shall mean any individual, corporation, partnership, trust, or other entity, however denominated. For purposes of these Bylaws the term <strong>“affiliate” </strong>of a specified person shall mean any person (i) that, directly or indirectly (through one or more intermediaries or otherwise), controls, is controlled by, or under common control with such specified person; (ii) that is a director, officer, trustee or employee of either such specified person or another person that constitutes an affiliate of such specified person; (iii) of which either such specified person or another person that constitutes an affiliate of such specified person serves as a director, officer, trustee, or employee; or (iv) who is a spouse, father, mother, son, daughter, brother, sister, uncle, aunt, nephew or niece of such specified person or of any person described in the preceding clauses (i), (ii) and/or (iii). A <strong>“business day” </strong>shall mean any day which is not a Saturday, Sunday or any day which is a legally-recognized holiday in the State of Nevada.</p>
<p><strong>Section 9.02. Computation of Time. </strong>In computing any period of time under these</p>
<p>Bylaws, the date of the act, event, or default from which the designated period of time begins to run shall not be included. The last day of the period so computed shall be included, unless it is a Saturday, Sunday, or a legally-recognized holiday, in which case the period shall continue until the end of the next day that is not a Saturday, Sunday, or recognized holiday.</p>
<p><strong>Section 9.03. No Waiver. </strong>The failure to insist, in any one or more instances, upon observance and performance of any provision of these Bylaws shall not be construed as a waiver of such provision or the relinquishment of any other right granted herein or of the right to require future observance and performance of any such provision or right. The waiver of any violation of any provision herein contained shall not be deemed to be a waiver of such provision on account of any other violation of the same or any other provision of these Bylaws. No provision of these Bylaws shall be deemed to have been waived, unless such waiver is approved by the Board and such waiver is in writing and signed by the president of Oath Keepers.</p>
<p><strong>Section 9.04. Partial Invalidity. </strong>If any provision of these Bylaws or the application thereof to any person or circumstance shall, to any extent, be invalid or unenforceable, the remainder of these Bylaws or the application of such provision to persons or circumstances, other than those as to which it is held invalid or unenforceable, shall not be affected thereby, and each provision of these Bylaws shall be valid and enforced to the fullest extent permitted by law.</p>
<p><strong>Section 9.05. Applicable Law; Jurisdiction. </strong>The laws of the State of Nevada, as such laws have been interpreted and applied by the courts of the State of Nevada, shall govern the validity, performance, and enforcement of these Bylaws. Any proceedings with respect to the performance or enforcement of these Bylaws shall be brought in the District Court for Clark County, Nevada, which is vested with exclusive jurisdiction.</p>

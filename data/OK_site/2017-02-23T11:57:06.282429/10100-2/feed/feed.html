<content:encoded>Don’t bother with the fools around here Ed.   They just don’t care about reality.   They want to live in their fictional world and throw out a simpleton’s view of Constitutional Law mostly founded in the racist and fantasy view of things of Sovereign/Posse Comitatus citizens.   (Of course ironically they’ll even ignore the local’s and local Sheriff’s views if they cross their outside views).

<content:encoded>Who were all those anonymous Oathkeepers in Burns? Why won’t one of them run for Sheriff?
<p>There’s still time to get a candidate for Sheriff or Judge (Grasty’s not running) or Commissioner.</p>

<content:encoded>dave are you a burns resident ? just curious… the lunatics i see here are the people who directed and participated in this bonnie &amp; clyde style roadblock ambush &amp; murder. conducted as it was away from the public eye is telling ! i feel senator ron wyden with his public comment ” THE VIRUS MUST NOT SPREAD ” is what put the nail in the coffin so to speak. if you are a burns resident you have my sympathies, it will be tough for a bit, hopefully all have learned something meaningful.

<content:encoded>The Oregon Legislators rushed to create a Law, blocking the names of the wanderers of LaVoy.  They were “afraid” that the Officers “might” receive death threats.  But they seemed quite brave….shooting down an unarmed man.  Oregon is steeped in corruption, from top to bottom.

<content:encoded>Oath Keepers and 3%ers are the American Taliban. They roll in to own in pickup trucks dressed like mercenaries toting their AR-15’s and hard eying anyone who dares to look at them. The Idaho 3% set up a perimeter at the courthouse while Curtiss walked in and started making demands of Sheriff Ward.  I can tell you right now that this infuriated the locals every bit as much as what happened to the Hammonds. I’d like to se Curtiss try this in his own AO (Ada County Idaho) and see how it works out for him.  
<p>This incident really brought out the lunatic fringe of this movement.  Ritzheimer and Cooper going in to town and harassing a woman that was wearing a BLM t-shirt… what real tough guys.</p>
<p>Oath Keepers and 3% had better learn to choose their battles wisely because there’s a column forming in this country that has no use for .Fed or lunatic militia types and we are armed as well.</p>

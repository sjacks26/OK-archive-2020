<p style="text-align: justify;">This article points out the reality of the difference between Peace Officers and Law Enforcement Officers. Law Enforcement Officers are programmed to enforce the law, without using common sense, and to think of the average citizen as the “enemy”. They are also encouraged, (or more correctly, forced), by their superior officers to bring in revenue from fines, and to make arrests as often as possible. Those who say, “If you are doing nothing wrong, you have nothing to fear”, need to realize the programming of the Police, and the increased militarization of the Police as a method of control of everyone, be they guilty, or innocent.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There are still some Peace Officers, but they are disappearing. They are not wanted by the men and women in charge. – Shorty Dawkins, Associate Editor</p>

<p>by Matt Agorist</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">New York, NY — A common meme amongst those in the police accountability movement is that it is only a matter of time before an entirely innocent person crosses paths with the wrong cop and gets a hefty dose of police state USA.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">All too often we hear the ridiculous statement from the apologist crowd saying, “If you don’t break the law, you have nothing to worry about.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">However, that statement couldn’t be further from the truth.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://thefreethoughtproject.com/you-break-the-law-every-day-without-even-knowing-it/" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://thefreethoughtproject.com/you-break-the-law-every-day-without-even-knowing-it/', 'Former NSA official William Binney');" target="_blank" title="William Binney">Former NSA official William Binney</a> sums this myth up quite accurately, “The problem is, if they think they’re not doing anything that’s wrong, they don’t get to define that. The central government does.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Attorney Harvey Silverglate argues that <a href="http://www.harveysilverglate.com/Books/ThreeFeloniesaDay.aspx" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.harveysilverglate.com/Books/ThreeFeloniesaDay.aspx', 'the average American commits three felonies a day');" target="_blank" title="Three Felonies a Day">the average American commits three felonies a day</a> without even knowing it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In reality, there are<a href="http://thefreethoughtproject.com/wrong-plenty-fear-30-examples/" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://thefreethoughtproject.com/wrong-plenty-fear-30-examples/', ' too many cases to count of innocent people');" target="_blank" title="Free Thought Project"> too many cases to count of innocent people</a>, some who’ve been recognized as pillars of society, being attacked and imprisoned by a system which claims to protect them.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When people assert that not breaking the law protects them from police abuse, those of us with our finger on the pulse of this corrupt police state, answer back by stating, “it’s only a matter of time before they are proven wrong.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As a point of clarification, it is important to state the difference between hating cops and holding police accountable.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Those of us who hold police accountable are often referred to as “cop haters” and “anti-cop.” Police officers are human beings, they are our brothers and sisters, mothers, fathers, and sons and daughters. To blindly hate a person because of a badge is irresponsible as well as dangerous. However, equally irresponsible and dangerous is to blindly apologize for criminals and psychopaths because of that same badge.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">That being said, former police apologist, Carsten Vogel, had his “time” come last month. According to his Facebook page, Carsten Vogel was one of those people who seemed to blindly support police, no matter what.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">During the NYPD slowdown, Vogel was involved in a heated argument with a Facebook friend, according to the <a href="http://blogs.villagevoice.com/runninscared/2015/01/a_few_weeks_ago_when.php" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://blogs.villagevoice.com/runninscared/2015/01/a_few_weeks_ago_when.php', 'Village Voice');" target="_blank" title="Village Voice article">Village Voice</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“The police in NYC are now refusing to make the mayor look good,” Vogel wrote in a thread on his Facebook page. “I get it. I don’t think the police are abandoning their jobs or responsibilities. I think they are refusing to play the game.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">However, in January, Vogel’s attitude would quickly change after he was approached by an NYPD officer on a mission to deprive someone of their rights.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Vogel was on his way to work when an NYPD officer detained him and asked him what he had in his pocket. Vogel was carrying a completely legal pocket knife, which was visible by the clip on the outside of his pocket.</p>

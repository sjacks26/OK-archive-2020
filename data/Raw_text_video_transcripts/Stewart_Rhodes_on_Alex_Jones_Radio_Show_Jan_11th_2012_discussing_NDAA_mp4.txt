## Alex Jones; Stewart Rhodes; Rob from Pennsylvania; Shawn from Tennessee

Alex Jones: [00:00:01] And again he's founder and director of Oath Keepers, served as U.S. Army paratrooper until disabled in rough terrain parachuting accident during a night jump, former firearms instructor, former member of Ron Paul's DC staff. Stewart currently writes the monthly enemy at the gates column or did for Swat magazine. he's a graduate of Yale Law School where his paper solving the puzzle of enemy combatant status won Yale's miller prize for best paper on the Bill of Rights. and he also is taught U.S. military history at Yale. He was a Yale research scholar and is also writing a book on the dangers the applying the laws of war toThe American people what has now happened. Oath Keepers dot org. OK Stewart let's give people a snapshot of history. But first let's get into my breakdown. And any would you like to elaborate on that. Or add anything to it. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:00:53] Well I think you're correct. that that's the that's the response we have to have. I mean we need to prepare for the very worst. And so but on the way there like you said, we have a very narrow window of opportunity to raise the awareness of the American people and to do all we can through peaceful means. and while we're doing that, just the same with the founders did they exhausted all their peaceful means but they also rallied more people to the cause, won more people over and steal them up and harden them got them ready for the confrontation. and that's what we have to do, both things. And so what I encourage people to do is go look at what Jefferson and Madison did in response to the Alien and Sedition Acts in 1798, which were a gross violation of the First Amendment. They did two things at the same time. One they nullified, they went to the states and said you have an obligation to interpose and nullify. You said anything contrary to the Constitution is null and void from inception. It is not law. It is nothing. So that's the attitude we have to have. We do not give it any recognition whatsoever. You can say they passed in an unconstitutional, invalid statute but it is not lawful. We do not recognize it. That's what Jefferson and Madison did. They didn't go to the federal courts and beg them to recognize that this was a gross violation of the First Amendment. They went to the state legislature and said you have an obligation. 

Alex Jones: [00:02:18] Those who don't know, they tried to bring in tyranny Just a few years after our country got on its feet and the original founders got together and said lock and load. We're going to try to peacefully back them off. But if they don't it's another war. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:02:30] Right. With the Alien Sedition Acts criminalized speech. you had a newspaper editors, reporters, writers being arrested for criticizing the president, John Adams the second president of the United States. and the Federalists were doing this during the kind of quasi war with France. So throughout history it's always during wartime that they try to convince you you must give up your liberty in the name of fighting the war. And so the Federalist in the name of fighting the war against the French the French, the undeclared war against the French, tried to silence dissent. And so Jefferson and Madison, like I said, they did two things at once. They said is null and void from Inception, in Kentucky and Virginia resolutions the States stood up. but they also started a whole new political party and they swept the Federalists out of office in what's now called The Revolution of 1800. They you know Jefferson was elected president and they swept all the Federalists out of Congress. And so that's what we need to do right now in response to this atrocious unconstitutional, intolerable act. 

Alex Jones: [00:03:35] This was our history repeats itself. If we didn't have such fraud and modern mind control. Undoubtedly he'd be the presumptive nominee. He would defeat Obama and we would see a repeat. We're just in worse states than our founders were. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:03:49] Yeah. Ron Paul is is Jefferson. Let me take off my Oath Keeper hat for a second and just say that as an individual I endorsed Ron Paul, as an individual a veteran of combat arms and airborne, as it as a legal scholar. There is nobody else out there who is going to defend the Constitution like he will all. the rest of them would have been just like McCain who wrote the NDAA. Obama has already committed treason, he's killing American citizens. He's declared himself an elected dictator essentially and the rest of them up there. Romney, Gingrich, Santorum they'd all be the same. So you know this Mr. Jefferson. Ron Paul is the closest thing to a modern Jefferson there is. He's like Jefferson re-incarnate. And if you don't vote for him you are you are furthering us on that road to having no choice but to fight for our freedom again. 

Alex Jones: [00:04:42] Isn't it curious as how many historians and scholars have noted that history repeats. I mean it doesn't so much repeat as it rhymes. Who was it that said history rhymes. That was Mark Twain. I mean it really does go in cycles. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:04:58] Well it does and it's always warfare. If you look at after the Alien Sedition Acts they they put that genie back in the bottle. They have the peaceful revolution of 1800 took care of it. But then you came. Then came the Civil War. It was in a civil war in the name again of national security that Lincoln became essentially an elected dictator. He imprisoned newspaper editors, he imprisoned congressmen. He even wrote an arrest warrant out for Chief Justice Taney when when he balked against his suspension of habeas corpus. So you know he just just decided he's going to do whatever he wanted to do. And all of his supporters in the Republican Party, the original Republican Party, were all for it. And in the north this is this is the precedent this is the first time that the power of the president as commander in chief was used against the American people. He claimed the authority much like Bush and Obama. He claimed the authority to apply the laws of war not just to the the breakaway southern states that had seceded and become their own country. He also applied laws of war to Northerners and the Supreme Court in 1866 and the ex parte Milligan case ruled that unconstitutional. But that's a case that came after the war was over. 

Alex Jones: [00:06:14] And it doesn't matter though whenever they're taking over stakes today they always go back to what Lincoln did which in the North was undoubtedly classical tyranny. I understand the more sophisticated nuances of the British manipulating the south the all of it it's it's always a double game. But undoubtedly and Stanten after that and executing people extra judicially. and in modern times they're pointing at that and saying they'll use it against us. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:06:40] Oh exactly. That they sweep under the rug. The fact that the Supreme Court ruled all of that completely unconstitutional. in Ex parte Milligan in this case it was a case of a man who was accused of violating the laws of war. He was a citizen of Indiana. He was a civilian but he was accused of violating laws of war. And Lincoln had detained 15000 American northerners under military jurisdiction. And he had tried almost 5000 of them by military tribunal. And this guy was one of those. And so they they said look the laws of war apply to him and therefore a military tribunal is all he's going to get. That was the argument of the government lawyers. And in fact they said this of the bill of rights. they said these in truth are all peace provisions of the Constitution and like all other conventional and legislative laws enactments are silent amidst arms. 

Alex Jones: [00:07:32] Stay there. Be right back. Stewart Rhodes we're going to go back to that quote the other side. this is key know your history folks. 

Alex Jones: [00:07:41] And. Take a look out your window. Here's a scene you need to catch. 

Alex Jones: [00:07:58] Sometime Satan. 

Alex Jones: [00:08:07] The new world order says they're doing all this to keep us safe. But they're not doing that are they. 

Alex Jones: [00:08:20] You know Stewart looking at history and I want to continue here with you on the history that we're going to have on Ron Paul right now and take some calls. But tyrants behave the same as well they always have to hire a bunch of people that will follow any order. So then over a short period of time the very worst gravitate into positions of power and so the tyranny degenerates quickly and always causes a rebellion against it because even the sheep are forced to stand up just for self-preservation. So there's a wild frenzy that ensues and we're now seeing just government getting crazier and wilder and more arrogant and frothing by the moment. Please continue. Gotten up to the civil war right. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:09:06] In that case about the use of military tribunal against the American citizen in the north. The court Supreme court in 1866. The government lawyers argued the exact same thing we're hearing now. They said by the Constitution as originally adopted no limitations were put upon the warmaking and war conducting powers of Congress and the president. And then as a fallback they said finally if the military tribunal has no jurisdiction the petitioner may be held as a prisoner of war aiding with arms the enemies of the United States and held under the authority of the United States until the war terminates, which is exactly the argument that Bush made and Obama and now Congress in the NDAA. The same argument that the powers of the commander in chief are unlimited. 

Alex Jones: [00:10:01] Yeah you've got to prove that somebody is aiding a foreign military. Put the proof up that's why we have trials. Oh no. Not only will we secretly arrest you, we'll never even have a public trial and no one must know that we grabbed you. I mean that that's open tyranny right there. That's always the greatest threat. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:10:19] Well the Constitution mandates in article 3 section 2 that all crimes must be tried by a jury. And that article 3 section 3 defines the crime of treason and it defines it as making war against the United States or aiding its enemies. That is the definition of treason. And so today are they're circumventing that trial requirement or a plain text of the treason clause and they're circumventing the bill of rights just like the Lincoln administration. 

Alex Jones: [00:10:51] Let's take that plain reading if you're waging war or aiding the enemies the Congress is pretty much globalist run, they actually fit the original treason definition. They're waging a war against our Bill of Rights, Constitution, Our free market, our private property, our sovereignty, our borders. They are the tyrants. I don't just say that they are traitors they are treasonous. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:11:13] Exactly. Well they fit the exact definition of treason making war against the American people. They're asserting the power of the president to treat the American people exactly the same as if they were Iraqis. 

Alex Jones: [00:11:25] We're America. I see these newscasts where the government's getting ready to deal with their main threat, us the American people what we're the government. We're the people. Romans 13 we're the government. Render under us it's our country. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:11:40] I want to I want to read you what the Supreme Court had to say in 1866. They rejected completely that argument. They said even these provisions, the Bill of Rights, expressed in such plain English words that it would seem the ingenuity of man could not have made evade them are now after the lapse of more than 70 years sought to be avoided. Those great and good men foresaw that troublous times would arise when the rulers and people would become restive under restraint and seek by sharp and decisive measures to accomplish ends deemed just and proper, and that the principles of constitutional liberty would be in peril unless established by irreparable law. That's what the Bill of Rights is, is it's irreparable law. They understood human nature. They understood that people can be driven by fear to give up their freedom. And that's why you have a Bill of Rights that leaves that out of the reach of the people even when they are afraid. 

Alex Jones: [00:12:40] And it's the highest level nothing can abridge it because it only enshrines inherent organic rights that are inalienable. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:12:49] That's right and the Constitution would never been ratified without the promise of the Bill of Rights. When you read the Preamble to the Bill of Rights it tells you what its purpose is it is to prevent misconstruction. It is to prevent abuse of powers granted in the Constitution and prevent misconstruction. And yet they willfully misconstrue it. Yes they did it. They are doing it now. 

Alex Jones: [00:13:12] The Congress and the president are in open treason by the very constitutional definition. And of course they are engaged in other criminal activities like Fast and Furious. They are the enemy of America. 

Alex Jones: [00:13:38] Well constitutional lawyer, Yale scholar, veteran, former Ron Paul staffer, founder of Oath Keepers dot org Stewart Rhodes is our guest. I want to get to some calls and I want to have you back on for another interview on this, but let's continue with the history because these aren't just words we're saying here. We have a government that is totally illegitimate and has been caught committing so many crimes It's dizzying, for special interest profits and now they're openly selling shutting down free speech on the web. And checkpoints and TSA checkpoints, total federalization, Tenth, Ninth Amendment violations. They're not just eating around the edges now they are in full assault on the heart of every basic liberty not even our Constitution or Bill of Rights. the finest example of it. They are burrowing in the Magna Carta. They are annihilating just common sense. They are they are trying to manifest every even absurdest dystopic cartoonism of tyranny. But they're setting it up beside us while Liberty still is practiced and is ongoing. And the two rails are now going towards a collision course. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:14:58] That's right that they've created the second track exactly like was done in Nazi Germany, in Stalinist Russia. And unfortunately during the Civil War in the United States. and but the Supreme Court put that genie back in the bottle in 1866. Lincoln opened the, let the genie loose of martial law, you know use martial law. The Supreme Court ruled this, here's what they said. no usage of war could censure a military trial for any offense whatever of a citizens of incivil lived in no wise connected with the military service. Congress could grant no such power and in honor of our national legislature be it said, it has never been provoked by the state of the country even to attempt its exercise. Even in a civil war The US Congress didn't apply didn't try to authorize military trial. so that the current Congress has gone even further than than what they did during the Civil War. So one of the court said, one of the plainest constitutional provisions was therefore infringed when Milligan was tried by a court not ordained and established by Congress and not composed of judges appointed during good behavior. In other words not an article 3 court, not a jury trial. And so this is, what happened then is precisely the same thing that's happening now and it's also exactly what the founders faced. If you look at the Declaration of Independence they list among the grievances is denial of jury trial. And also. The attempt to impose upon them a juris- jurisdiction foreign to their constitution. and back then what Parliament had done was they passed statutes that expanded the jurisdiction of the admiralty courts as a way to strip the colonists of their ancient right to jury trial. 

Alex Jones: [00:16:51] In the exact same thing is being done here again. So what happens as the crooks who admittedly get caught insider trading so Congress says well it's legal for us to because we say so. Again another pure tyrant statement. The pure The fuhrer precept that I'm the leader I do whatever I want. what happens as it becomes manifest that it is illegitimate it is fraudulent. It's got a gaggle of criminals posing as media deceiving and dissembling the truth over the public. They've seized the infrastructure. They're accelerating the dismantling of the country. They're demonizing Americans who actually know that they're the enemy and foreign and illegitimate. and it's all hurdling towards confrontation and the enemy knows that we're now awake to them and instead of just being hubris filled is scrambling quickly to try to man the parapets against us as the economic collapse accelerates. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:17:51] Well they understand it's a two way window like you've said for a long time. It goes both ways, it's a two way window. They understand that the more extreme they get, the more illegitimate they get. The more of the curtains pull back and we see the little man behind the curtain, we realize how illegitimate fraudulent he is. And so there are taking the mask off. But in many ways that's helping us. The NDAA is a gift to the freedom movement. I mean they were already claiming these powers. Both Bush and Obama already use these powers. Bush detained two American citizens Jose Padilla and Yasser Hamdi and Obama just started killing American citizens, so they're already doing it anyway. So I like the fact that they were brazen enough to put it right there in black and white in a congressional statute. because now it's waking Americans up finally. I mean I've been saying this for since 2001 i've been fuming about this. And it was hard to get him to listen to it. but now they understand that they are destroying the Bill of Rights. It's not a conspiracy theory. It's right in their face and so it's a tool for us to wake them up. But but getting back to the history real quick. after that attempt to apply the laws of war, after that usage was ruled unconstitutional by the Supreme Court in 1866, It was never used again until 1942 during World War 2 by FDR. There were eight German saboteurs that came ashore. One of them claimed to be a US citizen. They were captured and tried by a tribunal. And the court In that case in Ex Parte Quirin, the same New Deal court that found it OK to and in turn the Japanese-Americans over 100000 U.S. citizens. The same court that gave FDR everything else he wanted in the New Deal. Unrestrained power. They ruled that the citizenship of the saboteur was irrelevant. They ruled that what counted, So the court said, was what he was accused of doing. so because he was accused of violating the laws of war, The court ruled that he would get a military tribunal rather than a jury trial. So they totally up up turn the ex parte Milligan decision from 1866. They totally ignored the treason clause and violated the Constitution grossly. And that is the precedent that after that was not used again until post 9/11. And that's the precedent, Ex Parte Quirin, The Bush administration reached back to from 1942 grabbed it and said hey look we can do whatever we want even to American citizens and. 

Alex Jones: [00:20:27] Let's get to the heart of this. We're told this is done to stop Al Qaida who's been given Libya, who's being used to attack Iran all on record. And when you get all the internal documents, the MIAC and Homeland Security reports and all the rest of it. It's admitted as you know. But for the audience maybe new listeners, that it's all about conservatives, libertarians, Patriots, oath keepers, Ron Paul, Bob Barr, Alex Jones, filmmakers. It's clearly an attack on the American people and they're training the police for this. None of it has to do with the you know the Arab terrorists that they were first selling. So they always sell on an unpopular minority just like Hitler did. Then it's expanded on to everyone. And it's just so transparent we've got to get that message out. But I mean constitutionally obviously it's a 10th Amendment, 9th Amendment cause it's jurisdiction and then it's a fourth amendment. but all over the country now they're having federally run and there's a new one have you read the fine print. The Orange County Register is reporting on this, we can put it on screen. Police use a roadblock to gather serial killer information. in the last few months three homeless have been stabbed in a town so they go out on a highway and it shows video of it, shut down the highway and ask people if they saw anything. I mean this is completely random, makes no sense. And it's the Feds running and it turns out it's basically a TSA ice breaker of why they're setting up unconstitutional checkpoints. and that many other areas they even dispense with that they just actually just pull you out of your car and search it. 

Alex Jones: [00:21:59] But then I mean you can clearly see them testing the perch you can see them or you know really trying Oh the Army's here to help search your car for alcohol. Oh the Marines are here you know. Now we see the military on the streets I mean they're really. And then that's the proof of the criminality is that they're doing it incrementally by design to acclimate everyone involved. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:22:23] Yeah exactly like like you said it was just like what they did in Nazi Germany, the Reichstag fire decree was the reaction to the burning of the legislature. And it was aimed supposedly aimed at the Communists, but then they immediately expanded it out from there to trade unionists and then to Jews and on down the line. And the same thing is going to happen here is happening right now. The demonization as you said is targeted at constitutionalists, targeted at you know veterans targeted, at cost at conservatives and libertarians. And one thing people need to understand is that there was a law review article written back in 1996 right after Oklahoma City where two lawyers argued that the laws of war should be used against McVeigh to try them by military tribunal. And they also said that Clinton should use the laws of war against the militia movement. And they cited to the ex parte Quirin case from 1942 and they argued that it should be updated and used against terrorist suspects. And so that is precisely what they argued and wanted is what has now been put in place first by the Bush administration. And so the original idea of using the laws of war against terrorism was actually first thought of about it would be used against right wing domestic terrorists and right wing radicals. That was the first proposed use during the Clinton administration. The Clinton didn't do it. But Bush then did what Clinton did not do. He updated that as the old 1942 case and applied it to the so-called war on terror. And so now what Clinton did not have in it at his fingertips, Bush put in place and now Obama has like a ring of power out of the Lord of the Rings. It's right there on his desk whatever he wants to he can grab it and use it. 

Alex Jones: [00:24:18] And and notice he went there all these different manipulations where oh it didn't affect citizens but then it did affect citizens. But don't worry we won't use it against citizens. But oh he's going to veto it so it's OK and then he does sign it. I mean it's they're using laws of war against us. We're we are the enemy and it's all deception. But look at this article. police use roadblock to gather serial killer information, if you scroll down the video on the Orange County Register. It shows a major highway shut down and people pull up to FBI with clipboards demanding they answer questions. I mean this is clearly just turning everything into the TSA and then they use an excuse to sell the public on. We're trying to get a serial killer. No they're not. They know full well this isn't how you find a serial killer. I mean it's just all about them seizing the roads, seizing the infrastructure and training us that they will stop us when they want. We will answer their questions when they want to. 

Alex Jones: [00:25:20] This is an FBI that ships guns into Mexico to blame the Second Amendment. This is a government That is terrorist. I don't I don't know what else to say. Stewart what would you do if you just pull up to a checkpoint with the FBI out of their jurisdiction on a major highway in the middle of California in Orange County in Anaheim demanding to basically you know answer their ghoulish questions. I mean it's just it's sick. These people are so sick and of course. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:25:49] We have to you have to refuse. We have to use civil disobedience and yet to nullify as individuals we have to start refusing and withdrawing our consent. and something else. 

Alex Jones: [00:26:00] But again it's this idea that if anything could ever kill you we've got to have checkpoints there. So oh my gosh three homeless women stabbed to death here. And so we'll just start shutting down the entire area and making you all prisoners. I mean do people see this is the perfect excuse to take over everything that the military industrial complex is eating America right now. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:26:21] Well I think more Americans are waking up to the fact and like I said that's that's what's good about this, is the more they overstep and the more they do this, the more it wakes us up. But we have to, if we wait too long to fix this then we will become acclimated. It's a choice between becoming the fourth reich. You know are we 1934 Germany where they just quietly went along with it and and and sat down and shut up because they were afraid of being jailed. or are we 1774 America in the Spirit of 76. You know that's what we have to choose. 

Alex Jones: [00:27:00] Let's to expand on that. I mean let's expand on that. this is the entire acclimation program and they really want to get us ready for checkpoints everywhere so you're on a pickup list and you don't know when you pull up and they grab you and disappear. Right. And I want to warn the police and others I mean once it goes to this level you're not going to have a very safe job. I'll tell you right now. And what. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:27:23] Well you know I've talked to veterans already across the country and they all say the same thing. They say well how do I know if I get pulled over by a police officer how do I know it's a normal police stop that it's not some black bag thing to be turned over to the Department of Defense taken off Guantanamo. And my answer now is well you know right now they probably won't do that but that's where we are headed. And like you said once the first one is detained like that, every other veteran, every other American out there is going to be like well hey I will not know, I'm going to assume the worst. I'm going to resist. a lot of them told me that that when that day comes and they see that they are actually in danger of being black bagged they will not allow themselves to be handcuffed even by a police officer because they will not know. 

Alex Jones: [00:28:12] Because the government is illegitimate. I mean again the devil look at these quotes almost every comment here in the Orange County and there's hundreds of them. What a dumb idea. Really a roadblock. Most people driving in Orange County have no clue to who is actually sitting next to them in a vehicle let alone close to who you know some bum was hacked to death in a dirty riverbed miles away. Here's another one. It goes on. Civil rights violation, sounds like Nazi checkpoint with regular citizens having no rights. Do our police really believe they have gathered this much power that They can just start doing this. Yeah. Their bosses who were criminals tell him to do this. This is Perche testing. It goes on. Complete violation of Terry versus Ohio. And here's a many and kudos to the special task force you're on. You're out in the community trying to get things done. Good job guys. He probably works in the county. Your ignorance of your rights could not be more complete terror management theory at its best. And it just goes on with the comments almost no one buying any of this information. It seems to me that they are stopping people with hope of raising revenue. Yeah they did do some arrest and sticker tickets while they were in it. It's all just a sickening excuse under federal ghoul control that the feds weren't busy shipping guns out and little kids out of the country. It goes on to say I do not think that they will uncover much stopping many people because they are in the area. Maybe I'm wrong. Is this even legal a random checkpoint to interview potential witnesses seriously. No Fourth Amendment issues here. and it just goes on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on. The good news is Stewart we're not buying it are we. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:29:57] No. And more Americans across the country are not buying it. And that's that's why we are different than the Germans. That's why it will not go the same way as Germany slid into a dark tyranny with a whimper. We will not whimper, we will not not go that. 

Alex Jones: [00:30:13] What about 3 million guns, 1.5 million plus instant checks in the month of December alone breaking all records. I mean there aren't even liberals anymore in this country that know how to talk. I mean so-called liberals are all buying weapons and everything. I mean there are a lot. What does the New World Order think they've done Stewart. Every liberal I know is arming to the teeth and is waking up. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:30:33] And we just had El Paso County Colorado pass a resolution against the NDAA nullifying it. And that's what has to happen across the country. And in fact I'm going to a meeting this weekend in Topeka Kansas where we're bringing legislators and activist in all over the country and we're going to draft model resolutions and build on what was already done in El Paso County Colorado and spread the message of nullification at the Local level towns counties and states. 

Alex Jones: [00:31:03] It's happening. And you know the feds can say well at that we nullify that. no we nullify you. You work for offshore banks. You individually may not be a criminal but. You work for a system that is run by criminals. The heads of your organizations are mafia organized crime scum. You are illegitimate and the Republic is rising. we veto you. 

Alex Jones: [00:31:32] I'm gonna do a little bit of overdrive so I can get to the caller on hold the longest like Rob and Sean and others. Stewart Rhodes is our guest. Yes yes but look at another one of these comments here on the Orange County Register where they have giant fed run checkpoints searching and demanding answers from people about a serial killer miles away in some ravine stabbing homeless people Weeks after. one of the commenters Rick Marinos says if you have any information don't call. You might get a minute. The police you might get a better response calling Anaheim or the FBI. I called the town more than three weeks ago with a video came out of the bank robbers asking for any information that someone might have. I left three messages for two different detectives and never did they call me back or even a thank you even though my info was good. 

Alex Jones: [00:32:25] Now folks I've called the Homeland Security numbers on air they have on TV. Terrorist no one ever calls you or you say I know where terrorists are. They're like OK name and number. They never call you. I mean I know that the heads of al-Qaeda at the Pentagon I have all the documents and the like but even even if you say I have information on terrorists they don't call you back. It's all fake and they know it. They know it. Austin's got tens of millions of dollars in the last decade. You know on million and a half dollar robots and they go out once a week and blow up a cardboard box on the highway and ninny and it's just all about milking us. It's just a total scam and a state of fear, while the criminal city council robs everyone. I'm sorry Stewart Rhodes comments on this. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:33:10] Well you're right it's like a disease like a cancer that has spread metastasized and spread. and it's the same thing the Founders faced right. A swarm of officers sent out to eat away at their substance. I mean everything that we're experiencing they experienced. that's why we should call people who who want checkpoints and all that should be called loyalists and they should be given. We should give them red coats as gifts and that's their that's their badge. That's what they really are. They have. They have rejected the the Republic they've rejected the concept of freedom. They want to live like a third world dictatorship like North Korea. They should just go there because. And we should just call them what they are. You know, they're totalitarians. They're loyalists. They would have been perfectly at home being a Tory Back in 1775 and calling for the military trial of of the American colonists and the rebels and calling for the arrest of John Hancock and Sam Adams ducking away in a military brig. So that's what they are. 

Alex Jones: [00:34:19] Or putting him on a prison ship to starve to death. Rob in Pennsylvania you're on the air. Go ahead. 

Rob From Pennsylvania: [00:34:26] Very riveting, very riveting discussion and happy to hold and listen through it. Like to get to my point very quickly. Francis and friends is a show normally hosted by Francis swagger. Jimmy Swaggart's wife. It's on the sunlight Broadcasting Network and I happened to be listening over the web and yesterday Donnie Swaggart her son was hosting. and on the show he falsely proclaimed that Ron Paul is quote unquote not a Christian and does not know the Lord Jesus Christ and characterized Ron Paul as anti israel and pro Muslim. 

Alex Jones: [00:35:01] Is that because Ron Paul doesn't visit low rent prostitutes. 

Rob From Pennsylvania: [00:35:06] And Today's show was just as bad with Donnie swagger characterizing Dr Paul as a fruitcake and an alien from another planet. 

Alex Jones: [00:35:14] I don't know about all those guys but the whole system is attacking Ron Paul. What does that tell you. 

Rob From Pennsylvania: [00:35:21] That's exactly right and I'd like to say that I did my incremental part by posting these videos on YouTube under under the title Dawney Swaggart falsely proclaims Dr Paul not a Christian. And there was another instance where Francis Swaggart was hosting a show and she called you a traitor Alex, and she said that she characterized you as a traitor for discussing America's problems with RT and basically equating you going on RT with traveling to Russia. 

Alex Jones: [00:35:50] I know that's a neo con outfit. They've been a host of other groups have been calling for my arrest because I'm a British and French and Japanese TV. I mean it's just they're just they're loyalist traitors and they don't want me talking about the republic. But whenever I've heard those little discredited people so good good for them. 

Alex Jones: [00:36:12] You know we're looking at how tyrants always operate, Stewart. And they always say people that are criticizing them work for a foreign power. And I've got to take your rights and clamp you in irons because you're not a patriot. But we're the people actually defending America And what made the country great. and it's so simple we're fighting global banks that take over countries and then use false nationalism to play our countries off against each other. What would you say to the last caller before I go to Sean. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:36:47] No. I've heard the same allegations made against you and also Ron Paul. I mean, Congressman Paul as a Christian I used to work with the man, I used to work for him. And I can tell you that that's you know he's a very principled pro-life Christian. but he's a constitutionalist also and he stands on the constitution and that's what all of these Roman 13s twisting obedient loyalist Fake Christians don't like. They want obedience. They want submission. Absolute submission to the state. That's why a really great book out right now by Chuck Baldwin on Romans 13 that I recommend. 

Alex Jones: [00:37:24] We've had him on about it. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:37:25] That's great. So you need to. That's the that's the that's the antidote to all that nonsense. But there are loyalists there are loyalists over. 

Alex Jones: [00:37:33] Most of these churches are 501c3 and the feds tell them you promote our agenda or you're going to lose it. They have the clergy response teams. I mean it's like in China the Communist have a loyal church. They allowed to operate the same thing. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:37:46] That's right. That's right. So you know the best way the best way to handle them is to boycott them. Like the founders did, shun them. Boycott them. 

Alex Jones: [00:37:55] That's right. I mean I see police now and I walk over in a restaurant whatever and I say how are you guys doing. Where you down on the Constitution and the republic. They say well we stand with it I go good job I shake their hand but they act weird I go oh it's weird for a citizen to come over and talk to you. You want to ask yourselves why you think that's weird. You want to ask yourself why. Why me the little slave talking to you was weird. How has America gotten so weird that We're not supposed to communicate with each other. It's time to get out of your shells folks or be put in a cell. Time to get out of the shell or be put in a cell. Either hang together hang separate. Let's go ahead and go to Shawn in Tennessee listening on WJOC 1419 am in Tennessee. Go ahead. 

Shawn From Tennessee: [00:38:33] Alex I love your show. I'm glad to finally get you here in Chattanooga. We had so needed this kind of information for a very long time now. I mean you are truly appreciate an ear for all you do on this program to fight these globalists. 

Alex Jones: [00:38:46] Thank you. God bless you. 

Shawn From Tennessee: [00:38:49] You're truly appreciated. And I'm also a big supporter and regular listener to another one you might be very familiar with on GCN quite often there were pastor Butch Paul. 

Alex Jones: [00:38:57] Oh great guy. Need to get him on. 

Shawn From Tennessee: [00:38:59] And he fights these exact same people you just mentioned the father wincing 501c3s. And but I have a question if you don't mind. And that relates to a super technology that the government uses to control the ionosphere and jet streams and weather pattern. 

Alex Jones: [00:39:13] Talking time about harp. 

Shawn From Tennessee: [00:39:15] Yeah absolutely. Well I wonder if this same technology used possibly controlled people or political dissidents. 

Alex Jones: [00:39:24] Well the other is that they wouldn't use the big antennas for that but they've got patented little small psychotronic things that they've use. there's actually been treaty's on that. The euro, the U.S., and Russia not to use it from 1979. Stewart you want to get into any of the secret of weapons that you've read about or anything. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:39:44] I mean all I really know about the something you've heard about. I don't know much beyond that. 

Alex Jones: [00:39:50] Yeah and you know a lot of these super high tech weapons and stuff it's all just bravado. It's all a system trying to look at the people that win wars are the people that don't stop fighting and we have right on their side. OK. Tyrants never succeed when people stand up against them. Take Gandhi. He spent 30 years just getting the Indians to have respect for themselves and learn to stand up and when they stood up there was done the British Empire could do. Closing comments on that Stewart Rhodes. Thank you so much Sean. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:40:19] That's actually correct. I mean that's the that's the great secret that they don't want you to realize. the truth is that you are, in the end, you hold all the power in your hands. and you includes the military and police. And that's why I our oath keepers because they can't do without them. And so that's what we should look towards. What happened in 1989 in East Germany has been talked about on your show, a mass standdown and a mass stand up by the people. 

Alex Jones: [00:40:46] You know once and I've already got a guest on The Nightly News Tonight but we might want to either today or tomorrow. Tape more about the police and the military choice because that's the most important part of this discussion. And I didn't even get into that maybe we should take that put it on the news tonight and then air it tomorrow on the radio part two. I'll talk to you here at the end. Stay with us. Retransmission coming up now

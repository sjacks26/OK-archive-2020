## Richard Mack

Richard Mack: [00:00:04] What do we owe them today? to go along with the federal government and the tyranny that's facing us today? It's ten times worse than what they had. We need to get moving here and don't make any mistake. I totally agree with what Stewart said earlier and I'm going to reiterate it and nobody is to say any different. This is a peaceful process. I'm the most peaceful man you've ever met in your life. In 20 years of law enforcement I never shot anybody, never slugged anybody, never hit, Beat up anybody, never nightstick, tasered. Any of that. It's not necessary. Most of the time. And that guy that showed him on YouTube that tasered the 72 year old great grandmother. He's twice her size and he has to taser her. You know what we know from that incident? that guy is in the wrong line of work. That's all we know from that. And he needs to go look for another job, maybe you know being a bouncer where you can get in fights more or something. 

Richard Mack: [00:01:07] The Tenth Amendment basically says this federal government if you think the founding fathers ever forgot something, you can't do that either. Now. Where do I put my citizens rule book. OK right here. we have got to understand and let your sheriff know this as well. What's the purpose of government. We hear we hear all the time politicians when they're running for office or yesterday when they're celebrating the Fourth of July that they'll talk about we hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created equal. They don't know anything about that but they'll still spew it out of their mouths like they're big heroes. And you ought to vote for him again because they know the first two lines of the Declaration of Independence. and then after you talk about that among these are life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness. I ask them the next line. to secure these rights. Thank you. Governments are instituted among men to secure. 

Richard Mack: [00:02:20] So why do we have government? to secure these rights. Sheriff why are you here. Anybody in the state rep. We have a state rep. Moore Yeah. Why do we have it. Mike. No wonder I heard that name before Mike Moore. I hate your dad. OK good. OK. That's all right. No no. Why do we have Mike here in Montana Montana's state legislature? to secure these rights. Why do you have a president. Well let's not go to him right now. Why do you have a U.S. senator why do you have a state rep. Why the US rep, dogcatcher, sheriff especially, cops, chief of police. all of them need to know and understand that their main job Is to secure these rights. OK. That's it. 

Richard Mack: [00:03:34] How far off are we. Well let's look at the if we just wanted to look at one little thing. Ronald Reagan left office 20 years ago and five months. You know what his budget was when he left? $450 billion. And he said it was too high. He should have abolished a couple of departments, he said he was going to abolish the Department of Education, didn't do it. We still need to help him keep that promise. And you know get on to some others too like the IRS and a few others. And do you know what the budget is today. Does anybody know what it is today. Can anybody count that high. It is increased in 20 years Eight hundred percent. Yeah man why don't they put that on Wall Street. Invest in government. You know darn well next year it's going to be bigger. And this is a lot bigger. And just to show. 450 billion and it was too big even by his own admission it was too big. Four hundred fifty billion. And it was too much. And now. 

Richard Mack: [00:04:43] And folks that's why I reiterate and Stewart touched on this a little bit. This isn't partisan because who did that. And those of you still trying to cling to the Republican Party a little bit. They were there and in charge. They had they had it all anyway. It's both parties. They both have done it. And now what do we do. We participate in this paradigm shift where locally, I can't wait for the sheriff and the governor and the state rep and other people who say we are going to stop sending our money to that cesspool of corruption in Washington D.C. And we're going to withhold even income tax from that beast that is using our money to destroy us with. We're not going to do it anymore. Man I can't wait to be part of that plan. So. Another thing I can't wait for is for a sheriff To warn the IRS about no more confiscation and seizures of homes and then they do it and he arrest them. Man I can't wait. I'll do it. Oh my. Gosh i can't wait for that day. OK. 

Richard Mack: [00:06:07] What what excuse. You know there's there's lots of there's there's lots of naysayers. Page 22 I think. The last couple of paragraphs. And I'm talking about you know the sheriff. when it comes to the IRS. in 1998, Did you know that Congress actually held hearings about the abusive and criminal nature of the IRS and employees current agents, Jennifer Long being one from Florida, testified before Congress of the crimes IRS was committing against you and us citizens. It actually happened to my father right after he retired from the FBI. He's teaching school part time now in Law Enforcement of community college. 

Richard Mack: [00:06:53] They do a random audit. Are random audits law enforcement constitutional things to do. No we couldn't. And when I was a cop I couldn't go looking around the community. You know what. I'll bet they're abusing their kids in there. Let's go audit them. Isn't that more important than then auditing for money. Yeah we're saving children. It's for the children. I mean how many times Bill Clinton say that. So that's all that was always a good excuse you could violate the Constitution as long as it was for the children. OK. So why not have local law enforcement start going in homes and check interview the kids see if they're being abused. That's more important than auditing to see if you paid all your taxes. This is for the children. You can't do it. Stewart said this earlier. no matter what we want to do, The Constitution restricts it. And guess what. This principle was applied in Mack Prince. It's, It's absolutely amazing. 

Richard Mack: [00:07:56] Look at page thirty six I think it is real quickly. Yeah. The second paragraph the very first line. But the Constitution protects us from our own best intentions. Did you get that. It's probably the most powerful thing I've heard from the Supreme Court in a century. but the Constitution protects us from our own best intentions. You want me to go on. I'm the next part isn't in this book but the Constitution protects us from our own best intentions. It divides power among sovereigns. And among branches of government precisely so that we may resist the temptation to concentrate power in one location as an expedient solution to the crisis of the day. End quote. That's all in the Mack Prince case. Isn't that beautiful. So principled. So true. So right on with the founding fathers intent of every bit of this. 

Richard Mack: [00:09:01] And do you know how we get back. You know how we get back to our Constitution. We have a sheriff that reads this book and he says you know what. This stuff's right. I don't have to let these guys in my county anymore. I don't have to go along. No he doesn't banish them. He doesn't go up to every IRS and forest service agent right now and say you're out of here. But he does put them on notice. Wouldn't it be wonder if we had like 30 sheriffs in Montana wrote a letter to the federal government and all their auxiliary bureaucracies and say look we've got a new policy here. the constitution will be enforced. No violation of it will be allowed and any type of violation of the constitution will be treated by this sheriff's office as a criminal offense and we will take action. Read your constitutions especially your bill of rights, you federal government employees because its violation will not be tolerated in Lincoln County or in whatever county you live in. OK. It will not be tolerated. Why. Because I took an oath to it and I'm a constitutional guard. I'm not just the Shire of the reeve.

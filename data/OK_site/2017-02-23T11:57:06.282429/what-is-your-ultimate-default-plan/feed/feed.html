<content:encoded>It never ceases to amaze me how unaware some folks are of what a SHTF situation entails.  Most folks are not aware that when the grid goes down they won’t have water.
<p>We should rethink CPT to start with the very basics of preparedness rather then security.  Without preparedness items there is nothing to secure. </p>
<p>We may be loosing the Community concept of CPT, also.  We most definitely need to be squared away but the concept is to go into the communities and get them “squared away”, as well.</p>

<content:encoded>Sitting down, envisioning and writing down a plan to fall back one that is quite close to subsistence is a good idea. The problem I see when I talk to people who have done this is that they have fallen into the same trap as any ideological people will. It looks good on paper but will it actually work to keep you alive? Write up your plan then actually go see if you can survive camping in cold weather or planting a garden where you decide to stay (you may be surprised that your favorite vegetable won’t grow well or that you should have taken the family cat to keep vermin off it). Simple things like finding a spot to camp that is bug free, doesn’t flood during heavy rains or is protected from storms is not easy to do. Falling off the learning curve (and you will) while you still have a safety net is okay. Falling off the learning curve in a survival situation will get you killed.

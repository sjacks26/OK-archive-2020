<p>Larry Smith For Congress</p>
<p>A very misrepresented situation occurred on the border near Brownsville <span><span><span><span>on Friday</span></span></span></span> afternoon.</p>
<p>BP agents were searching for a tattooed male that crossed the border in  some heavy brush. During the search they came across several armed  citizens that were on private property at the owner’s request.</p>
<p>The individuals asked the BP agents if they needed assistance. They agreed and the two groups started searching the brush.</p>
<p>Several minutes later another BP agent exited the brush and began firing  at one of the citizens, who was armed with an AK pistol.</p>
<p>From less than 30 feet the agent missed five times. Which was lucky for  both men. The citizen had the discipline not to return fire as he  understood the situation better than the BP agent.</p>
<p>Rather than admit wrong-doing and resolve the situation, the citizens’  guns were confiscated to facilitate an investigation. Their cameras and  radios were also taken.</p>
<p>Furthermore, pressure was put on the land owner to deny these men access to reduce the maneuver space of these volunteers.</p>
<p>I was very disappointed in Channel 5, which failed again to cover the  real story with substandard reporting. I am also highly disgruntled over  the handling of the situation by both the Border Patrol and the Cameron  County Sherriff’s Department whose actions resulted in attempted  murder, assault with a deadly weapon, and civil rights violations.</p>
<p>The next time you are calling these guys hillbillies, rednecks, or  gun-nuts try and remember the family of Javier Vega and what the border  policies of the Democrat Party did for him and his family.</p>
<p>So it may even cost me a few votes, but I am standing with these men.  They are standing up for American communities that are under threat; and  I support their heroic actions.</p>
<p>Lastly, if you deny the border problems here in the RGV then you are  either ignorant or you are benefiting from the criminal activity.</p>

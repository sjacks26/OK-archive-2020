<content:encoded>How convenient, no body cam recording of this incident ! They meant this to be an opportunity for murder and they were not going to be incovenienced by facts and witnesses to the contrary !<br/>
I know those of us here are all familiar with the phrase, “trust me!” Now we are to believe a “standing army” of irresistible force arrayed against quiet citizens on a desolate highway is to be trusted? Finicum and his associates were not fleeing felons and the level of violence exhibited against them is reprehensible. These quiet people were no Bonnie and Clydes !<br/>
The aerial footage has been completely moderated to prevent any identification of type of aircraft, operator, operator’s location, altitude, and lacks sound. It is essentially a mute, unreliable witness.<br/>
We can only hope that there is one person of conscience who was present who will eventually come forward to reveal this for what it is, a deadly ambush.<br/>
I drove to that location and it is disparagingly desolate. The lack of other vehicles traveling between Burns and John Day cannot help but be noticed. The area is noticablly uninhabited, at least little evidence is seen from the road itself except for the intermittently placed campgrounds.

<content:encoded>Attack and expose the language of the collectivists and the left.  The “people”, “the masses”, “the country”, “the citizens”, “the common good”; they are all straw concepts.  I have never met Mr. Masses, Mrs. People”, “Mr. Common Good”.  Emphasize that using collective terms enables one to justify or ignore the harm to the individual.  Notice that if you emphasize every individual, the collective is taken care of, by definition.  And remember always: never waste time on the ideologically committed.  They will never change, and attempts to change them are a drain on time and resources.  Finally, let us all stop wasting our efforts on worrying and over complaining about what the people and institutions on the left say and do; it is just the enemy acting like the enemy.  Instead, engage only in activities that are likely to defeat or eliminate their threat to liberty.  We didn’t complain about Hitler, we destroyed him.

<content:encoded>Smitty,
<p>I have all the professional video production equipment already and the know how to use it. I offered my services early on in Oregon standoff to the PPN. I sent in my information in response to their call to action so I could be vetted by them and get on the ground there and start reporting. The problem is communications my friend. No one responded to me! I have been ready willing and able to take on this task of doing professional reporting for the Patriots for a long time now. The issue is that I cannot survive without an income and our groups do not have a whole lot of money to do this kind of thing with. Look, I am not looking to get rich, I just need enough to pay my bills and pay production costs. I would absolutely LOVE to quit my current job and be a full time reporter for Oath Keepers and PPN. As I said though the problem is communications within our groups. I can only imagine how many people like me responded to the call to action and were never contacted back and were left wondering if their message was even read or not. In my view this is the most serious problem we have is a lack of an organized communication structure. </p>
<p>I stand 100% ready to “Create highly visible media operation to create high quality video. Control the narrative.” Just sign me up. I have been an Oath Keeper since the very beginning and I have already done video work for the Oath Keepers. Bottom line for me and I suspect for others too is that we have to have SOME income from doing this in order to devote full time to it. So that is a matter for the OK and PPN boards to decide if we can collectively support a real media operation. Volunteers are great but they can’t always drop what they are doing at a moments notice and go do the job. Anyway Smitty I like your ideas a lot.</p>

<content:encoded>If they are able to secure legislation sealing the responsible officers for LaVoy’s death from being revealed, that will be one more law to see abused.<br/>
Also, the bullets that struck LaVoy should be forensically matched to the guns to determine  the actual shooters involved.<br/>
I am sceptical of allowing the shooters identities to be sealed from the public who is the employer.<br/>
It may seem like a good idea now but the dangers arising out of such legislation are significant.<br/>
If you don’t want to be held responsible for your actions, don’t become a law enforcement officer.

<content:encoded>An Oregon Democrat is not seeking to rush through legislation that will prevent identifying the Leos responsible for LaVoy Finicums death.<br/>
How is that supposed to work out.?

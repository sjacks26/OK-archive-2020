<p style="text-align: justify;">Colleges are no longer places of learning. They are places of indoctrination; nothing more. The University of Tennessee is in the grips of political correctness, (more properly called political idiocy). There is such a thing in this country as the First Amendment, which enumerates several inalienable rights, among them being freedom of speech and religion. The nation is being being destroyed from within by ridiculousness and what passes for “education” is idiocy. – Shorty Dawkins, Associate Editor</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The University of Tennessee at Knoxville warned students to not throw Christmas parties because someone might somehow be offended.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Another holiday, another opportunity for college administrators to trample students’ free expression rights as part of some comically misguided effort to prevent offense. Last week, the University of Tennessee at Knoxville issued a breathtakingly Scrooge-ish (Scrooge-ian? Scrooge-esque?) piece of advice: “Ensure your holiday party is not a Christmas party in disguise.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The diversity officers who wrote this instruction must have a lot of extra time on their hands, because eradicating secret Yuletide gatherings doesn’t exactly seem like a pressing higher education issue.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The university, thankfully, has since re-discovered its Christmas spirit, but not before inspiring bewilderment and anger among some students, as well as quite a few Republican politicians who hysterically interpret any slight against Christmas as an attack on Christianity itself. U.S. Republican Rep. John Duncan had this to say: “The people on the far left who claim to be tolerant seem to be tolerant of everything except traditional Christianity. They don’t object to Jewish, Muslim, Hindu or any other religion’s traditions. But they go unhinged on anything that hints of traditional Christianity. They try to take down Crosses and Christian emblems. It is a shame and very sad. And it is extremism.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Lt. Gov. Ron Ramsey, also a Republican, wrote that Tennessee’s very reputation was at stake:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“If this post was approved by [UT] Chancellor Cheek, he should resign. If not, the entire staff of the Office for Diversity and Inclusion should be dismissed.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">War on Christmas histrionics aside, UT’s pronouncement on holiday parties was undeniably tone deaf. On the website for the Office of Diversity and Inclusion, administrators advised members of campus to <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2015/12/07/furor-over-holiday-party-advice-u-tennessee-grows-there-and-spreads" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2015/12/07/furor-over-holiday-party-advice-u-tennessee-grows-there-and-spreads', 'forego Christmas regalia');" target="_blank"><span style="color: #0000ff;">forego Christmas regalia</span></a>:</p>

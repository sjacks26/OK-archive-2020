Caption: Sheriff Richard Mack Tucson, Arizona Memorial Day 2011

RM: Being Memorial Day, I’d like to start with Judge John Roll, who lived here in Tucson, started as a federal district judge here in 1992, was murdered here on January 8. He was a great man, a great example to all America to what a real judge should be. He didn’t allow politics, his personal political opinions, to be part of his decisions. He actually based his rules, his decisions, his rulings I should say, and his decisions, on the Constitution, on the historical perspective of the Constitution. That’s why I say he’s such a great example to other judges. In this day and age of political correctness and legislating from the bench, Judge Roll would not do that. He was the first judge to hear my lawsuit, without him it wouldn’t have made it to the Supreme Court. Today I want to honor him as well as the Marine veteran that we honored this morning, Jose Guerena. I really want all of you to study what you can about Judge Roll, and the things he stood for, and the amazing man we lost on January 8. You remember, that was the shooting that Dupnick was trying to blame on us. You’ll remember he actually singled out Sarah Palin and Rush Limbaugh for creating an atmosphere where people have to just start shooting each other. That’s the type of leadership we have in this county. It’s so obvious that this man has been at the job way too long.

RM: (0:02:20.8) I would like to go back historically. Why the big increase of SWAT team usage in America. Do any of you know why?

AM1: The war on drugs.

RM: Heavens. We have to have the war on drugs. Actually, though, if you go back and look at television, you’ll see another reason. Remember tv shows in the early 80s? SWAT was one. Do any of you even know what SWAT stands for? Special Weapons and Tactics, yeah. So we gotta go on drug, marijuana, a guy’s growing 3 small plants in his basement, and we need special weapons and tactics for that? He’s a pothead for god’s sakes. It mellows you out, okay. Maybe you cops should try some.

RM: (0:03:36.6) You can seriously look at the history of SWAT team and how the scale of SWAT team creation coincides with Hill Street Blues and the SWAT television movie, show. So SWAT becomes real big, and now all these chiefs in big cities want their own SWAT teams. Well, you go to all that expense, what do you have to do? You have to use it. Hey you guys, you’re having a departmental meeting and you say the city council bought my sales pitch, bought us a big SWAT van and paid for all this SWAT training and all the equipment and all these new guns, and we never use it. We got all ready for the dance, and we can’t dance. And so, they want to start dancing. No, I’m not talking about Adam Kokesh getting arrested at the Jefferson Memorial, that’s another issue. I’ll tell you, what I saw about my friend Adam Kokesh is I’m definitely on his side and not on the police side. 

RM: (0:05:08.3) So if you, seriously if you look at the schedule you’ll see that happened. Chiefs of police and sheriffs had to find reasons to use SWAT more often. What started happening, we’re going into the wrong homes, and people are getting shot because they don’t know why the cops are in their homes. And they think they’re looking at a suspect and this guy’s acting crazy, so they shoot him or tazer him. They kill dogs. Yeah, I mean they go in, the dogs don’t react really nicely to these, oh I fear for my safety so I killed the dog. Even worse, I fear for my safety and I kill a person. It’s gotten way out of control. I really object to the training mentality in SWAT. I was a hostate negotiator and we cross-trained with SWAT. SWAT is only supposed to be used when the negotiation stops. To say that SWAT should be there because somebody might have a gun. How many gun owners in Arizona alone? 5 million?

RM: I have assailed the Drug War as well. I once was a Drug Warrior, I was an undercover narcotics agent. I learned what the drug problem is and what the drug war is. Let me tell you all, the drug war is a farce. I would say hurry up and legalize all of it and leave the rest of us the hell alone.

RM: (0:07:18.3) There’s too much money in it, and I’m sure government doesn’t want to stop all that money from being poured, of ours, into the drug war. I don’t use drugs, and I pray you don’t either. But there’s one thing worse than drug abuse or drug addiction: the drug war is worse. What really bothers me about police officers is that they don’t get this in training, that we put the safety of the individual first. We’re trained in law enforcement that it’s my safety first. Where did we get that from? That’s the most selfish attitude I’ve seen in my life. When they came in your home, they should have said put the gun down, when they saw him. Put the gun down. You’re outmanned, outgunned, we’re the police, we’re from the Pima County Sheriff’s Office, put the gun down. And it ends. And I’ve got to ask, I’m sorry. I think this is extremely startling. We suddenly hear after the shooting that Jose shot at them. That’s the first thing we heard. Why did we hear that? Because the officers are what? Trying to CYA. Oh, we’ve got to cover this, we’ve got to cover our butts. So we better say he fired first. That should be the number one that Sheriff Dupnik is concerned about. He is their supervisor. He is the one they work for. He reports to the people of this community. Tell me why Sheriff, instead of making up more excuses as to why this death occurred in your county, I don’t want to hear any more excuses, I want you to tell me what disciplinary action and what investigation in internal affairs you’re conducting to see why an officer lied about a shooting. 

RM: (0:09:37.6) Now if he said that, and if he said Now that was a mistake, he didn’t really shoot at us. That means that some officer wasn’t going to go along. Some officer was going to cross the blue line and not support the lie. Because they found the gun with the safety still on, they know that this honorable Marine did not intend to shoot at them at that point. He was checking it out. Stewart was absolutely correct. The Marine was following proper procedure. Check your target out first. SWAT team members didn’t do that. In all police training I’ve ever had, it’s always know your target first. I’m going to submit this, I know it will shock a lot of police officers across the country, let it shock them, I hope it does. This is what you need to do. There’s one thing worse, my good fellow officers and sheriffs, one thing worse than getting shot: that’s shooting the wrong person. That’s what I could never live with. I would rather die than have to live with the fact that I took someone else’s life, an innocent person. I could never live with that. Take me first, before I do something like that. Could you imagine the 11 bullets that missed, had it hit her son or her? What would we be talking about now? What would the excuses be from the Pima County Sheriff? Could you imagine? 

RM: (0:11:50.0) And this brave Marine did exactly what Stewart said, put himself between the threat and his family. Made sure they were safe, then he went to find out what was going on. I guarantee you, I would have had my gun. It probably would have been a pistol rather than a rifle. That’s the kind of policy change we need. First, you have to look at the ridiculous nature and policies using SWAT teams in the first place. This could have been handled so easily without a SWAT team. I can only tell you about when I was a detective, we would have gone, I would have gone to his place of employment around the time he was leaving. I would have said Mr. Guerena, we’re going to do a search warrant on your home right now. You’re going to stay with us, you’ll be with Officer Smith, in his vehicle. Is there anything in the home you need to tell us about? He says no, my wife’s there, I don’t want her hurt. I say nobody’s gonna be hurt. We’re going to go in, here’s a copy of the warrant, give it to him, search the home. Do we need a SWAT team now? For Vanessa? Give me a break.

RM: (0:13:32.0) So the whole thing is defused, we’re still serving our warrant, nobody dies. And that is less of a threat to the officers, for gods sake. And neighbors. This whole thing. If this gets swept under the carpet. Please government, be accountable and responsible, and follow the rules. For gods sake, can we please follow the rules for once in this country.

RM: (0:14:12.2) My other plea has been to law enforcement for the past 20 years. Can’t we believe in America and still be cops? Can’t we still enforce the law but believe in American ideals? Can we believe in our Constitution? Can we believe in the Founding Fathers? Can we still believe what Patrick Henry said about the holy cause of liberty? And principles of freedom, of liberty? Can’t we have law and order and still be god-fearing Americans? Can’t we still care enough about each other that we put one rule first, the golden rule? That we’re not going to do anything to them that we would not want done to us. That’s the rule that needs to be far more important than enforcing the law. Maybe, if we have officers and sheriffs who follow the Constitution and put Americanism first, we’ll have fewer of these incidents. Instead of being trained, I go home no matter what. No. I don’t believe in that anymore. Maybe I just don’t fit the mold. And I don’t want to.

RM: (0:15:50.8) I’m going to tell you, there’s some things that happened getting us down here. There was some dissension in the ranks within Oath Keepers about not wanting to be here with Vanessa and your family. Some of them aren’t here. Stewart took a lot of heat. He’s taken a lot of heat since coming up with this most amazing organization. I’m proud to stand with Stewart Rhodes. I’m proud to have made a new friend today. Her name is Vanessa Guerena. I’ll say it again. What happened to your husband was wrong and I’m so very sorry. Everyone in Arizona, from the governor to the sheriff to every local officer, they all owe you a very profound apology. What happened there was wrong. I don’t pretend to be able to say that and make everything alright. Especially what you’re going to go through explaining your children. But I hope you’ll tell them that there were a lot of people here today in Tucson from all over the country that extend their heartfelt, sincere apologies to you and your boys. We love you and we’re here for you. This is America. I’ve written a little book, a lot of you have seen it, it’s called “The County Sheriff: America’s Last Hope.” On May 5, that wasn’t true. This Sheriff should be replaced.

RM: (0:18:34.7) Quickly in closing. On page 19 of the book, I quote James Madison. He tells us all that the greatest threat facing America is not foreign enemies. I would paraphrase that and say it’s not the cartels, it’s not al-Qaeda, it’s not Osama bin Laden. It isn’t international terrorists. As Madison puts it, he says we will lose, there are more instances of the abridgement of the freedom of the people by gradual and silent encroachments from those in power than by violent sudden usurpations or foreign attacks or foreign enemies. I believe that. I said over and over that the greatest threat we face today is our own government. Then on the first page, I quote Thomas Jefferson. He warns us that when government, when all government shall be drawn to Washington as the center of all power, it will render powerless the checks provided. What are the checks he’s talking about? The Constitution itself. It will render powerless the Constitution. And you know why the Constitution will be powerless? Because the people we’ve hired to take care of us will ignore it, and will trample it under their feet, because they’re smarter and somehow bigger and better than our own rule of law. And this is what we get when we allow that to happen. My question is, when government becomes venal and oppressive, to whom can the people turn for peace, safety, and protection? It’s obvious that your sheriff in Pima County is not the answer. We have got to do something about that. He’s been in way too long. Yes, I worked as a sheriff in Arizona for 8 years while Sheriff Dupnik was a sheriff. And I can tell you, I’m surprised at his lack of leadership, his lack of public relations skills, his overuse of SWAT teams. You might just say that if there’s anybody who’s been in office too long, it’s him. We need to tell him goodbye soon. I would call for his resignation. Then again, he’s probably too busy to recognize the need to do so. So I hesitate to even call for that, because he doesn’t get it, and I doubt he’d get it from me. If I could appeal to him to do anything, Clarence, it’s time for you to do the right thing and step down and let new leadership take care of this county. Don’t make excuses when you should be offering apologies. There’s a big difference between excuse making and apologizing. 

RM: (0:22:03.9) This is a time of mourning. I want to honor my own mother, who passed a way the day before Jose did. You know what. We were expecting her to go pretty soon, she was 89. Jose should still be here with his family. This was wrong. I’m grateful to stand and honor his memory and his wife and children and all the people we saw there today. What an amazing view of all those people standing there with Vanessa and her family today. What a beautiful procession that it was this morning. I’m honored to be with all of you fellow Oath Keepers. Stewart, the true leadership you exhibited in getting us here and getting in contact with Vanessa, was invaluable. Now there is no question, we did the right thing being here today with you.

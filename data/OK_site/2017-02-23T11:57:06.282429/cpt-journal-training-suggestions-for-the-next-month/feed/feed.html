<content:encoded>Cal, you are right about the teeth, wanted you to know.  Ten years ago I was shown a tiny cavity on top of  a molar.  I asked my new dentist recently how it was doing because no one mentioned since. He said it calcified, heeled itself. I drink milk and take calcium and magnesium. Thanks for the heads up on egg shells, that I will have to force down while claiming I will not be a hump back elderly woman.<br/>
Plus Stevia (plant) is good to replace sugar which is killing us, I’ve heard and made changes. I dropped the sodas twenty years ago. (Processed foods now and pharmacy later.) Glad I was taught to cook from scratch, and healthier for it. Stay away from palm oil, cheap and in most all processed food and hydrogenized oil. Poly and monosaturate is better. Read labels. Concord grape juice does increase good cholesterol and lower bad, and per the doc or a glass of red wine daily.<br/>
Also for a pet a German Shepherd is awesome and a natural guard as early as 10 weeks, my puppy is six months now. Though well fed she loves to dig deep holes for roots, water, loves broccoli stalks, collards and fruit. A survivor.

<content:encoded>Founding member, here.   First of all …… Cal …. you the man.  Great information.  Second, I live in Oklahoma City.  Who do I need to talk to as far as who is in charge of things in my community, and if no one is, I volunteer to do what I have to to create/lead a community org here.  Del City, OK.  Time to get involved.

<content:encoded>I am a Viet Nam Vet, (military Police Sentry dog handler) 1969-70. I also am an Oath Keeper and other Liberty Movement organizations. My problem is I have no other friends that are “awake”. I live in the Palm Springs area of California and would like to meet up with others of our ilk if there are any in this area. Can you refer. We need a CPT program in this area.<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
Rascal

<content:encoded>Thank you, Charlie BROWN, 
<p>Guess you can say I am obsessed so I study a lot of the way people survived, and kept their animals alive, throughout hundreds of years before corporate “farming” and control came along.  I cannot take all credit.  Friends who garden, and are interested also research, which turns up LOTS of information we all share (though we always verify). </p>
<p>Plus, most important to us at this particular time is that “Big Pharma” started with natural stuff that they modified (and not in a healthy way for us), then replaced, then outlawed. When those who serve within our governments talk “sustainability”, “green”, etc usually they are talking about destroying the soil, water, air, etc; the natural order of things and then blaming the people for the problems when it is really the corporations. Crop rotation is best for our planet.  Growing different things, not one exclusive thing for hundreds of acres.  </p>
<p>I believe our planet is a living organism in its way, and I know that most things are dependent on other things for the health of our soil, water, air, etc.  We have allowed corporate greed and those interested in total control to devastate much of it, and to turn our own attention to things not really important in the realm of things.  They still use subliminals like the one used in the commercials, movies, cell phones, etc to effect our thoughts, our feelings, and those are things we must overcome if we can.</p>
<p>If anyone else is interested please also research, verify, then hard document so this information is available for others, and safe.  It would be criminal to have to rediscover all that our ancestors knew because those who want us totally dependent on them are destroying the information.  </p>
<p>Not just on growing things for health issues, but on lots of things like steam engines, etc.  All of these things could become useful in the coming times.  Isn’t it time for us to create our own industry?</p>

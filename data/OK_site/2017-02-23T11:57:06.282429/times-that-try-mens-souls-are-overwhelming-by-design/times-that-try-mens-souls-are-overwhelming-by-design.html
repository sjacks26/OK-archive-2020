Only through courage, determination, preparation, skill and a commitment to do what it takes do they prevail. Or we could just post “Molon Labe!” comments.</p></div>
<p>THESE are the times that try men’s souls. The summer soldier and the sunshine patriot will, in this crisis, shrink from the service of their country; but he that stands by it now, deserves the love and thanks of man and woman. Tyranny, like hell, is not easily conquered; yet we have this consolation with us, that the harder the conflict, the more glorious the triumph. What we obtain too cheap, we esteem too lightly: it is dearness only that gives every thing its value. Heaven knows how to put a proper price upon its goods… — Thomas Paine, “The Crisis”</p></blockquote>
<p>The gun-grabbers are coming at us from all directions. Oath Breaker-in-Chief <strong><a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/article/425021/australia-gun-control-obama-america" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.nationalreview.com/article/425021/australia-gun-control-obama-america', 'Barack Obama');" target="_blank">Barack Obama</a></strong> and the leading Democrat contender for his job, the wretched unindicted co-conspirator Hillary Clinton, have both made citizen disarmament centerpieces of their political platforms, implying Australian-style gun confiscations are in the plans.</p>
<p>The “newspaper of record” took the unusual step of giving its citizen disarmament editorial front page headline placement, <strong><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/05/opinion/end-the-gun-epidemic-in-america.html" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/05/opinion/end-the-gun-epidemic-in-america.html', 'advocating');" target="_blank">advocating</a></strong>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Certain kinds of weapons, like the slightly modified combat rifles used in California, and certain kinds of ammunition, must be outlawed for civilian ownership. It is possible to define those guns in a clear and effective way and, yes, it would require Americans who own those kinds of weapons to give them up for the good of their fellow citizens.</p></blockquote>
<p>Another top-reaching paper, The New York Daily News, actually had the <strong><a href="http://www.ammoland.com/2015/12/sponsors-enable-hate-column-equating-san-bernardino-murder-victim-with-terrorists/" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.ammoland.com/2015/12/sponsors-enable-hate-column-equating-san-bernardino-murder-victim-with-terrorists/', 'hate-filled gall');" target="_blank">hate-filled gall</a></strong> to equate one of the San Bernardino massacre victims with the Islamist terrorists who murdered him and 13 other human beings in cold and calculated blood. And that goes to the heart of another evil plot being coordinated from the White House, that in anticipation of further Islamic terror attacks, what’s needed are edicts disarming more Americans.</p>
<p>“To begin with, Congress should act to make sure no one on a no-fly list is able to buy a gun,” the p-word (see Ralph Peters link, below) declared in a speech that should have focused on the threat he’s instead obsessed with importing and embedding throughout the Republic. “What could possibly be the argument for allowing a terrorist suspect to buy a semi-automatic weapon?”</p>
<p>Oh, I don’t know. How about the Constitution? How about due process? How about innocent until proven guilty? How about the entire process is secret, we have no idea how many are on the list and even less of an idea on how to get wrongly placed names off it?</p>
<p>But see, it all fits in nicely with the “progressive” contention that we shouldn’t say “radical Islam” (or “illegal alien”). Instead, we should condemn “illegal guns” (as in those semi-autos the gun-grabbers insist be confiscated), and “violent extremists” (that way, they can follow SPLC’s lead and put no-compromise gun owners and Oath Keepers on their prohibited person watch list).</p>
<p>And the thing is we then get dolts presumably on “our side” buying into the Big Lie and betraying the very people who gave them political power in the first place, like “conservative” <strong><a href="http://bearingdrift.com/2015/12/03/some-ideas-for-addressing-the-mass-shooting-epidemic/" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://bearingdrift.com/2015/12/03/some-ideas-for-addressing-the-mass-shooting-epidemic/', 'Brian W. Schoeneman');" target="_blank">Brian W. Schoeneman</a></strong>. The self-described “Republican activist” brags about his pro-gun creds: NRA endorsement, Virginia Citizens Defense League endorsement, and how he’s “to the right of Attilla the Hun” (Hint: that’s not exactly a confidence builder when the focus ought to be on promoting and protecting individual rights).  He then goes on to propose a mental health tax on all gun transfers (requiring payment to exercise a right and playing right into the <strong><a href="../cornyn-mental-health-bill-promises-protection-but-raises-concerns/index.html" target="_blank">mental health blanket dragnet liberty violations</a></strong>), the no-due-process “terror watchlist,” and a way for government to delay gun purchases indefinitely by giving turning NICS into the National  as Long as We Want to Take System, among other infringements.</p>
<p>We get other “conservatives” who appear to get it, such as Derek Hunter of Townhall, who correctly calls the <strong><a href="http://townhall.com/columnists/derekhunter/2015/12/06/the-democratic-party-is-a-death-cult-n2089473/page/full" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://townhall.com/columnists/derekhunter/2015/12/06/the-democratic-party-is-a-death-cult-n2089473/page/full', 'Democrats a “death cult');" target="_blank">Democrats a “death cult</a></strong>.” He hits all the right marks, how the gun-grabbers are waiting for blood to dance in, blaming gun owners instead of terrorists, how major media is going full throttle with the propaganda, how it’s a total logical disconnect to rail against police for killing blacks and then demand police be the “Only Ones” with guns…</p>
<p>And then he goes and shares all the reasons why we ultimately need to abandon our principles in order to “win”:</p>
<blockquote><p>When I hear Republicans and/or conservatives whine about this, that or the other thing when it comes to someone who agrees with them 80 percent of the time, I’m reminded of why we lose … I’d not only vote for Lindsey Graham, I’d work tirelessly to elect him if he wins the nomination … Anyone who doesn’t do all they can to win for whoever the Republican nominee is has thrown in with the left. They’re urinating on the Constitution … But if we get four more years of a Democrat, you can not only kiss the Second Amendment goodbye, you can forget it all.</p></blockquote>
<p>So voting in Quislings and backstabbers serves a greater good, and it’s not the enemy in your camp you need to worry about?  Turncoat Republican gun prohibitionists like Mark Kirk or George Pataki are better than Democrat gun prohibitionists? And we needn’t worry about Lindsey Graham or Paul Ryan or Marco Rubio and their suicidal “immigration reform” policies that, according to all credible information at hand, will result in the <strong><a href="../red-green-axis-spells-out-danger-threatening-to-destroy-the-republic/index.html" target="_blank">directed cultural terraforming</a></strong> of the Republic within a generation, not to mention an unchallengeable Democrat supermajority in the legislatures and the courts? Hunter can give us something besides wishful thinking and platitudes to assure us Republicans <em>über alles</em> aren’t also a death cult, albeit one that just takes a bit longer for the Kool-Aid to work?</p>
<p>And if the new majority votes out the Second Amendment, our only choice will be to kiss it goodbye? Turn in those guns, Mr. And Mrs. America?</p>
<p>That’s pretty much what “libertarian” blog Popehat wants us to believe in a post by attorney and talking head Marc Randazza, who, in his best Borg voice assures us <strong><a href="https://popehat.com/2015/12/07/you-are-not-going-to-resist-the-government-with-your-guns/" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'https://popehat.com/2015/12/07/you-are-not-going-to-resist-the-government-with-your-guns/', 'resistance with our puny rifles is futile');" target="_blank">resistance with our puny rifles is futile</a></strong>. But why stop at carpet bombing cities to crush defiant gun owner, when even <strong><a href="http://www.ammoland.com/2015/11/editorial-says-govt-would-defeat-armed-rebellion-by-making-major-cities-disappear/" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.ammoland.com/2015/11/editorial-says-govt-would-defeat-armed-rebellion-by-making-major-cities-disappear/', 'more genocidal options');" target="_blank">more genocidal options</a></strong> exist? Who but a traitor and a coward wouldn’t take up arms to stop such monsters?</p>
<p>They’re coming at us from all directions, aren’t they? These are the times that try men’s souls and there ain’t no end in sight.</p>
<p>But that’s the way it was when Paine wrote those words, and thank God no one listened to the naysayers and the “experts” who would have counseled unconditional surrender, turning in the troublemakers and begging for mercy. Many Oath Keepers reading this have gone through your own personal trials by fire and seen things through to the other side of hell on earth with principles and honor intact.</p>
<p>Today we remember Pearl Harbor, another time that tried men’s souls. On Dec. 7, 1941, <strong><a href="http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/ohio/obituary.aspx?pid=158172394" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/ohio/obituary.aspx?pid=158172394', 'my father');" target="_blank">my father</a></strong> turned 21. Hell of a birthday present, wasn’t it?  He went on with the Marines to Guam. <strong><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/06/01/AR2006060101988.html" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/06/01/AR2006060101988.html', 'His brother');" target="_blank">His brother</a></strong> was sent to Guadalcanal. How do you think the horrible choices they had to make, and the terrifying mortal challenges they were forced to face looked to them?</p>
<p>Point being, it’s what we who would call ourselves patriots are required to do. And it’s not just active law enforcement and military Oath Keepers who have a sacred obligation not to follow orders to disarm the American people. The rest of us have an equal commitment to those whose sacrifices bequeathed us the Blessings of Liberty, to ourselves and our Posterity to disobey such orders.</p>
<p>The way we get through to where we must go is to not give in to the ignorance and weaknesses of fools.</p>
<p>“First of all, he keeps speaking about ‘We can’t give in to our fears Don’t be afraid,’” Fox News Strategic Analyst Lt. Col. <strong><a href="https://youtu.be/mfzSlldIUHQ" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'https://youtu.be/mfzSlldIUHQ', 'Ralph Peters observed');" target="_blank">Ralph Peters observed</a></strong> following Obama’s Dec. 6 terrorism address to the nation. “Look, Mr. President, we’re not afraid, we’re angry!   … You’re afraid!”</p>
<p>That’s an astute observation, and it applies to everyone who doesn’t trust Americans with guns, with freedom, and with a commitment to cast out the parasites, the traitors and the criminals who seem to believe their function is to rule. It applies to “progressives” who would have the weak-minded believe opposing their depredations is the same as being “anti-government”</p>
<p>I don’t mean to abuse the great privilege that it is to write for Oath Keepers by suddenly veering into territory best left to those more conversant in religious principles than I will ever be, but Paine started it with his reference to hell not being easily conquered and Heaven knowing the proper price to put upon its goods.</p>
<p>“For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places,” Ephesians tells us. That we do, but it manifests itself in the physical world, and that’s where down payments on the final price are made.</p>
<p>We are facing dark days. We cannot lose courage and we cannot lose faith. And we cannot know what price will be required from each of us.</p>
<p>One thing’s for sure: It will cost a lot more than occasional blog comments and forum posts, at least for those who will make a difference. If you’re not already making them, there’s no better time than now to determine what your best ongoing efforts need to be, and how they can supplement the contributions and labors of others.</p>

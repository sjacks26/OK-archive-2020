So why not give a more complete picture on who this guy is? (WXYZ /Khalil Abu-Rayyan social media photo)</p></div>
<p>It’s the type of low-hanging fruit bust that gets <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3435142/It-dream-behead-Michigan-man-22-arrested-planning-shoot-Detroit-church-support-ISIS.html" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3435142/It-dream-behead-Michigan-man-22-arrested-planning-shoot-Detroit-church-support-ISIS.html', 'sensational headlines');" target="_blank">sensational headlines</a>, even if the actual level of threat deterred is uncertain at best. Khalil Abu-Rayyan, 22, is alleged to have been planning to shoot up a Detroit area church in support of the Islamic State.</p>
<p>‘It is my dream to behead someone,’ he told an undercover FBI agent via social media. He also spoke of his plans to shoot up a local megachurch and bragged he had an AK-47 with a 40-round magazine.</p>
<p>Rayyan was already on law enforcement’s radar for drug and gun charges following a speeding arrest last October. If allegations on the <a href="http://media.clickondetroit.com/document_dev/2016/02/05/SKM_C554e16020515520_2078266_ver1.0.pdf" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'download', 'http://media.clickondetroit.com/document_dev/2016/02/05/SKM_C554e16020515520_2078266_ver1.0.pdf');" target="_blank">criminal complaint</a> are pursued, he could also be prosecuted for lying on a Form 4473 about his drug use. Inexplicably, he “has <a href="http://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/wayne/2016/02/05/fbi-dearborn-hts-man-plotted-isis-attacks-church/79894722/" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/wayne/2016/02/05/fbi-dearborn-hts-man-plotted-isis-attacks-church/79894722/', 'not been charged with any terrorism crime');" target="_blank">not been charged with any terrorism crime</a>.”</p>
<p>Whether he ever possessed the capability to be a credible threat is unknown. He comes off more like an idiot stoner, and has so far proven to be nothing except self-incriminating, almost comically so. His conduct led to the traffic stop and arrest. His uncontrolled mouth led to the Detroit cops finding a .22 revolver in his car. And his online cheerleading for ISIS and indiscriminate sharing of his “plans” make it fair to question how far from reality this guy lives. Basically, he just comes across like a real dumb-***.</p>
<p>In spite of that, he’d still win in a game of “Are You Smarter than Gun-Grabber?” That’s because, unlike them, he’s at least non-delusional enough to understand that so-called “gun-free zones” empower monsters and set victims up for defenseless slaughter. And he also knows such kill zones give the attackers what they crave most: Success and “fame.”</p>
<p>Here’s what he had to say about that:</p>
<blockquote><p>“[I]t’s easy, and a lot of people go there, plus people are not allowed to carry guns in church. Plus it would make the news.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Yet if Rayyan had carried through on his plans, the very ones responsible for demanding citizen disarmament would be the ones exploiting the carnage, demanding more “common sense gun safety laws,” and accusing liberty advocates of having blood on their hands. In reality, the obscene blood dancers would have it on their feet.</p>
<p>There’s an interesting and perhaps telling omission – at least the information does not seem to be prominently featured in all the <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Khalil+Abu-Rayyan&amp;oq=Khalil+Abu-Rayyan&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j69i59.966227j0j9&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;es_sm=0&amp;ie=UTF-8#tbm=nws&amp;q=Khalil+Abu-Rayyan" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'https://www.google.com/search?q=Khalil+Abu-Rayyan&amp;oq=Khalil+Abu-Rayyan&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j69i59.966227j0j9&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;es_sm=0&amp;ie=UTF-8#tbm=nws&amp;q=Khalil+Abu-Rayyan', 'news accounts so far');" target="_blank">news accounts so far</a> – and it’s unclear if that’s due to oversight or intent: Does Rayyan come from a family of “refugees”?</p>
<p>It’s legitimate to wonder in light of Obama’s DHS assuring Americans they are employing “<a href="http://waronguns.blogspot.com/2015/11/just-how-rigorous-is-rigorous-anyway.html" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://waronguns.blogspot.com/2015/11/just-how-rigorous-is-rigorous-anyway.html', 'rigorous security screening');" target="_blank">rigorous security screening</a>” procedures, especially after the Boston Marathon bombings and the San Bernardino killings. It’s relevant in light of a report that DHS is <a href="http://www.wnd.com/2016/02/obama-dhs-scrubs-records-of-hundreds-of-muslim-terrorists/" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.wnd.com/2016/02/obama-dhs-scrubs-records-of-hundreds-of-muslim-terrorists/', '“scrubbing” Muslim terrorist records');" target="_blank">“scrubbing” Muslim terrorist records</a>.</p>
<p>One other bit of information that also appears to be incomplete: the complaint affidavit and all resulting media reports note Rayyan shared ISIS social media posts about, among other things, “men being thrown from a high-rise building to execute them.” At a time when Americans are being primed to warm up to “cultural diversity” and more massive immigration, it’s fair to wonder if mentioning that those were <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/world/2015/06/05/death-fall-isis-continues-to-throw-gay-men-off-buildings-under-guise-sharia-law.html" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.foxnews.com/world/2015/06/05/death-fall-isis-continues-to-throw-gay-men-off-buildings-under-guise-sharia-law.html', 'executions of accused homosexuals');" target="_blank">executions of accused homosexuals</a> might work against the “tolerance” narrative the rest of us are expected, pressured and coerced to live by.</p>
<p>At a time when Americans are <a href="http://waronguns.blogspot.com/2016/02/the-militia-menace.html" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://waronguns.blogspot.com/2016/02/the-militia-menace.html', 'being told');" target="_blank">being told</a> the real threat comes from its patriots, and those spinning that web of lies are <a href="../red-green-axis-spells-out-danger-threatening-to-destroy-the-republic/index.html" target="_blank">culturally terraforming the Republic</a> into something else altogether, those seem curious (and even  intentional) pieces of information to leave out.</p>

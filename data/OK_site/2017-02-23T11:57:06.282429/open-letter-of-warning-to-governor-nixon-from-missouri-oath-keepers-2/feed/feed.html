Declaration of Independence
<p>July 4, 1776<br/>
Show summary</p>
<p>IN CONGRESS, July 4, 1776</p>
<p>The unanimous Declaration of the thirteen united States of America,</p>
<p>When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature’s God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.</p>
<p>We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. — That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, — That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security. — Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government. The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world.</p>
<p>He has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and necessary for the public good.</p>
<p>He has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate and pressing importance, unless suspended in their operation till his Assent should be obtained; and when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to attend to them.</p>
<p>He has refused to pass other Laws for the accommodation of large districts of people, unless those people would relinquish the right of Representation in the Legislature, a right inestimable to them and formidable to tyrants only.</p>
<p>He has called together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable, and distant from the depository of their public Records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his measures.</p>
<p>He has dissolved Representative Houses repeatedly, for opposing with manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people.</p>
<p>He has refused for a long time, after such dissolutions, to cause others to be elected; whereby the Legislative powers, incapable of Annihilation, have returned to the People at large for their exercise; the State remaining in the mean time exposed to all the dangers of invasion from without, and convulsions within.</p>
<p>He has endeavoured to prevent the population of these States; for that purpose obstructing the Laws for Naturalization of Foreigners; refusing to pass others to encourage their migrations hither, and raising the conditions of new Appropriations of Lands.</p>
<p>He has obstructed the Administration of Justice, by refusing his Assent to Laws for establishing Judiciary powers.</p>
<p>He has made Judges dependent on his Will alone, for the tenure of their offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries.</p>
<p>He has erected a multitude of New Offices, and sent hither swarms of Officers to harrass our people, and eat out their substance.</p>
<p>He has kept among us, in times of peace, Standing Armies without the Consent of our legislatures.</p>
<p>He has affected to render the Military independent of and superior to the Civil power.</p>
<p>He has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitution, and unacknowledged by our laws; giving his Assent to their Acts of pretended Legislation:</p>
<p>For Quartering large bodies of armed troops among us:</p>
<p>For protecting them, by a mock Trial, from punishment for any Murders which they should commit on the Inhabitants of these States:</p>
<p>For cutting off our Trade with all parts of the world:</p>
<p>For imposing Taxes on us without our Consent:</p>
<p>For depriving us in many cases, of the benefits of Trial by Jury:</p>
<p>For transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended offences:</p>
<p>For abolishing the free System of English Laws in a neighbouring Province, establishing therein an Arbitrary government, and enlarging its Boundaries so as to render it at once an example and fit instrument for introducing the same absolute rule into these Colonies:</p>
<p>For taking away our Charters, abolishing our most valuable Laws, and altering fundamentally the Forms of our Governments:</p>
<p>For suspending our own Legislatures, and declaring themselves invested with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever.</p>
<p>He has abdicated Government here, by declaring us out of his Protection and waging War against us.</p>
<p>He has plundered our seas, ravaged our Coasts, burnt our towns, and destroyed the lives of our people.</p>
<p>He is at this time transporting large Armies of foreign Mercenaries to compleat the works of death, desolation and tyranny, already begun with circumstances of Cruelty &amp; perfidy scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages, and totally unworthy the Head of a civilized nation.</p>
<p>He has constrained our fellow Citizens taken Captive on the high Seas to bear Arms against their Country, to become the executioners of their friends and Brethren, or to fall themselves by their Hands.</p>
<p>He has excited domestic insurrections amongst us, and has endeavoured to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers, the merciless Indian Savages, whose known rule of warfare, is an undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes and conditions.</p>
<p>In every stage of these Oppressions We have Petitioned for Redress in the most humble terms: Our repeated Petitions have been answered only by repeated injury. A Prince whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a Tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people.<br/>
Nor have We been wanting in attentions to our British brethren. We have warned them from time to time of attempts by their legislature to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us. We have reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration and settlement here. We have appealed to their native justice and magnanimity, and we have conjured them by the ties of our common kindred to disavow these usurpations, which, would inevitably interrupt our connections and correspondence. They too have been deaf to the voice of justice and of consanguinity. We must, therefore, acquiesce in the necessity, which denounces our Separation, and hold them, as we hold the rest of mankind, Enemies in War, in Peace Friends.</p>
<p>We, therefore, the Representatives of the united States of America, in General Congress, Assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the Name, and by Authority of the good People of these Colonies, solemnly publish and declare, That these United Colonies are, and of Right ought to be Free and Independent States; that they are Absolved from all Allegiance to the British Crown, and that all political connection between them and the State of Great Britain, is and ought to be totally dissolved; and that as Free and Independent States, they have full Power to levy War, conclude Peace, contract Alliances, establish Commerce, and to do all other Acts and Things which Independent States may of right do. And for the support of this Declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes and our sacred Honor.</p>

<content:encoded>I have a team of 4 vets, but the average person in our community; if anymore asleep would be comatose. The normalcy bias is so thick it’s impossible to break through. I’ve got my end covered and appreciate the reassurance from you on yours.<br/>
Thanks: Rick

<content:encoded>Stewart, How long do we set back and allow this president use things like this to implement the national police force he so boasted about during his election. He is making the local police of every town USA look like a bunch of yahoo’s by the getting the governors to issue stand down orders. If this is allowed to go on game over, civil war on the home front
<p><strong>RESPONSE BY STEWART:  And that is exactly why it is critical that we Oath Keepers show our fellow Americans a better way, like we are doing right now in Ferguson, by successfully guarding four businesses.  We are showing them that they must protect themselves and each other so we are not vulnerable to manipulated crisis and incompetence (usually there is a mixture, depending on how high up the ladder you look).  The reality is that it ALWAYS comes down to the locals having to defend themselves and each other.  There are just not enough cops to do that during civil unrest.  We saw that back in the Rodney King riots, when the Korean store owners and their families had to defend their stores, and they did so successfully.  There were burned out and looted buildings all around them, but their buildings were intact.   And we saw it again during Katrina, and we see it after every Hurricane, with people standing on their front lawns with shotguns and rifles in their hands, protecting their neighborhoods.  That is what it takes.  </strong></p>
<p>And that is ESPECIALLY what it takes when there are also power-hungry elites who seek to maximize human tragedy, crime, and chaos for their own ends.  They want us to believe that there is no answer other than emergency decrees, “setting aside” our Constitution (as the Second Amendment was “set aside” during Katrina) in the name of security, and even justifying martial law if it is bad enough.   Here, we see an intentional, systematic failure to protect small business owners, while the posh fat cat politicians and their expensive buildings are always, always protected.    The people are made desperate, destitute, and full of fear, and then they are told “now, you must give up EVEN MORE of your rights, for your own good.”   They are told that they must militarize the police even more.  </p>
<p>The answer is to guard yourselves, and come together as a community to mutually protect each other.  That has always been the answer.  That is how we counter this manipulation of crisis – by doing what the “authorities” refuse to do – secure and protect those businesses.  If We the People stop the looting and arson ourselves, that kills the perceived need to set aside the Bill of Rights, and preserves the rights of both the property owners and their employees and any peaceful protesters, while also killing and defusing the push toward a race war, and it also kills any justification for further militarization of police.   </p>
<p>And so, we are not just sitting by as this happens.  We are doing exactly what we need to do – teach the people what the Founders expected us to do in such situation.  Remember, we are supposed to be the militia, the security of a free state.  That is supposed to be us, the people, not the government.  The Founders understood why that was necessary, and why you will not be either free nor secure until we get back to that reality and that timeless truth.  We the People means just that, in all things.  Not, “they the government.”  </p>
<p>it is funny, but sad, when I see comments on some article or forum discussion about our team in Ferguson, and someone says “they are trying to do the cops’ job, and they need to stop.”  No, we are doing OUR job, as Americans, and to the degree there is a lack of security, it is due to Americans not doing their own duty as the security of a free state.  Protecting ourselves and our communities has always been our “job” – our duty.  Always has, always will be.  The only question is will we, as a people, remember that in time, or will we leave that power vacuum to be filled with a hyper-militarized police state?   The elites want us to stay home, leave it to the police, and then when the police, and even the Guard, fail to protect people and their property, they will demand even more power, and many people will be tricked and scared into giving up what little is left of our Bill of Rights.  </p>
<p>We, as Oath Keepers, have a duty under our oaths to lead the way.  We MUST do it.  And we will.  And we ARE, right now in one small strip mall in Ferguson, guarding the bakery of a black woman, along with the businesses of her Asian and white neighbors, all of whom came together, united, and accepted our help.   You may have heard the annoying chant “this is what democracy looks like!”  Well, those united shop owners, of various races, standing together, and joined by American veterans standing guard all night, is what a <em>Republic</em> looks like!   Now, we need to teach them and their families how to guard themselves.  We will always be willing to help, but they must also become their own guardians.  That is liberty.  And that is what the Founders Republic really looks like.  The shop-owner with shotgun or rifle in hand, joined by his neighbors, whether veterans or not, all trained, equipped, and organized as the militia.  That is what we need to restore.  </p>
<p>And that is how we stop this.  How to get there from here?   CPT.  Neighborhood watches.   Sheriff’s Posses.  And it all starts with each of you looking in the mirror, and accepting that public duty to step outside your door, knock on your neighbor’s door, and get that neighborhood watch started.  Got team?  Got watch?  And when it comes to stopping looters and arsonists, the fundamental questions are:  who’s on your buddy team?  Who’s on your fire team?  Who’s in your squad?   Got team?  Well, do you?  If not, then get on it.  Build a team.  – Stewart</p>

<content:encoded>Most Governors are criminals, a few States are fugitive States, most States could not pass admission to the Union standards if they were kicked out, during readmission processes many State sponsored crimes would be exposed. Most States are very dependent and need the Union, there is where the battle lies for the ones that want to bail out, get the crooked ones kicked out and expose the corruption that the corrupt ones need, and thereby you will have your legal argument with worldwide appeal, you all lawyers don’t know tactics very well, do you? Remember Succession? Told you all yeas ago it would die out, I was right, you all had the wrong tactics.

<content:encoded>I am amazed that you folks have finally awakened to the presence of the police state. for this I was persecuted when I was a member,  and finally banned. At that time all I had done was to try ,  and educate the members who were police,  or retired to clean their own house, to make their brothers in blue understand that the path the police were taking was dangerous,wrong, and unconstitutional.<br/>
              I am not a cop hater, nor ever will be. Just one who when injustice raises it’s ugly head,  will address same without prejudice .  I am vindicated.<br/>
                                                                Edwin : O’Keefe
<p><strong>–<br/>
[Editor’s Note: You are too easy to be “amazed”. Oath Keepers was created to prevent the police state, Dude. I moved to Montana thirteen years ago to get away from the police state in Atlanta and Memphis. The fact that you claim we at Oath Keepers are just now awakening to the presence of the police state indicates that you never bothered to read my five piece article on the SWAT raid at Tucson in 2011. It also proves that in your zeal and zest to assert your ego’s superiority you managed to blast and blunder with stupid verbosity which insulted us and caused us to see that you viewed us as your students and exegetes — in other words, your arrogant rhetoric insulted us. Now you’re here to pat us on the head like we’re good little doggies who finally brought you the right bone. Whatever you want to think is fine with me, but your superiority doesn’t float here.<br/>
Go read all five installments of this from 2011 and let me know if I’m just now awakening to the presence of a police state, okay? Thanks.</strong></p>

<p>You’ll do better in this world if you learn to talk to people as equals, not talk down to us as if we are your inferiors who need to learn from you. Note that your attitude toward us did not get you very far with Oath Keepers.</p>
<p>Salute!<br/>

<content:encoded>Oh and to cal, I understand the constitution and following bi-laws, doesn’t mean they follow it, and if current trends are any indication, their operation under color of law while being granted immunity to persecution leads to one thing, they get what they want, PERIOD. it wouldnt’ be a pretty outcome I am willing to bet but let’s face the reality, these words are all well and good, but the reality of the situation is they will do as they please until a citizens miltia of considerable size with enough support backing it steps in. IE the bundy ranch incident.  they only understand numbers with ability of return fire.

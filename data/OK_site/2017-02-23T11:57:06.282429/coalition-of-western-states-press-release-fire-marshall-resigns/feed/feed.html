<content:encoded>I don’t get it, aren’t the Hammond’s in prison for arson? And shouldn’t the sheriff arrest this group for breaking and entering?

<content:encoded>If you pay close attention you’ll learn that the ex-Fire Marshal simply followed the car with the two suspicious dudes until it stopped. He did not pull them over, and he was not driving a fire truck. Sheesh!<br/>
Regarding who has access to government lists, well, since DHS created its Fusion Centers to interface local law enforcement with State and Federal enforcement agencies and (now) the U.S. military, anyone can get info on anyone. The ex-Fire Marshal has been in that County for many years and knows all sorts of public service people including LEOs. If you don’t know how things work amongst We The People, well, I’ve not got time to educate you.<br/>
What “smells funny” here is your failed attempt to cast disparaging interpretations of reality into the minds of readers at this website. You lose. The People win. 
<p>Salute!<br/>

<p><strong>D. Wysinger:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Testimonial: I am a proud American veteran of the Viet Nam “conflict”. I was given the command, and opportunity, to serve my Country in combat. With pride in God, Family and Country; I went, as my Father had before me. I am, in no way, a hero! The ones who earned that title did not return on a “freedom bird”. I am only an American Soldier.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I am old now; possibly past my usefulness, 100% service connected disability. However; I want to state this LOUD AND CLEAR. While I am not as fast, fit or strong as I once was; I am even meaner, when you mess with my family or Country!’ My oath HAS never, and WILL never expired! I AM AN OATH KEEPER till my last breath!!</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Marc Mauss:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Testimonial: I took my oath the first time in December of 1963, when I enlisted in the Naval Reserve. I took it the second time in June of 1965 when I entered the U.S. Naval Academy.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I love my country and will protect and defend it, even against its own government, if necessary.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Viper:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Testimonial: Hello all… Where do I start. I am a born patriot in a family that believes in God, Country and doing right by others. Every male and some female members of my family have served in the armed forces. Being a kid growing up and dreaming of the day it would be me in that uniform brought joy to my heart. Unlike most kids I never had a dream to go to college out of school. It was the Army and the Army only. I ate, breathed and slept the military, and everything about this great nation of ours. I have been a believer in not of the government but of the great people of this nation. It saddens me to think we are coming to a time where we have to worry about this type of stuff.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I have read the constitution front to back many times and I have long lived by the rules set forth in it. (and always will). I have faith that the men and women that have taken the oath, like myself, will do what is right at the time it needs to be done. I understand that our military members don’t have the freedoms we have and the rights to voice how they feel, and what they believe. I was once one of them, but trust me when I say this. EVERY ONE of them are patriots and this is why they do what they do. It is not the money or the glory. It’s the fact that some people have the calling for it, and when it comes down to it, they all have brains and MOST will do their main job: To support and defend the constitution.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I am grateful to have found this site, by accident, surfing the web in the middle of the night, trying to find as much info as I can to be informed with what is really going on. I thank god I’m not the only one and not the only one by far. There are thousands if not millions of us that haven’t found this site, or haven’t made it known that we are patriots. I still get cold chills and a tear in my eye every time I stand for the national anthem. And think how blessed I am to be born in the greatest nation on this earth.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Oath for me didn’t start the day I stood at the MEPS station and said it with my hand raised. It started the day I was born on this earth. It was breed in my blood and pumped thru my veins and does to this day. I want all of you to know I stand with you my brothers and sisters. And will do anything I can to help protect the right and liberties of every citizen of this great nation. I hope with numbers this can be resolved peacefully, and I hold faith that is what will happen. I pray I don’t see what some think is gonna happen. I pray the good people outweigh the bad, and I pray that we haven’t got caught up in what kind of cloths we wear , what kind of car we drive and how much money is in our bank accounts, and get back to what this nation was founded on. As more of us start to see what is going on and we reaffirm our loyalty to not the government but to what our founding fathers shed their blood for and see that, that very thing is slipping thru our hands as we speak one piece at a time.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I recited my oath tonight in my living room with my hand on the bible and a tear in my eye, and I thought to myself is this what is right? Is this what I should do? I thought back to all my brothers that lost their live’s fighting for this county. So here I stand putting my feelings out to everyone on here. I stand by you all and just like I gave my blood sweat and tears in 1997. I give that to you and willing to give my life if need be to protect what is right. United we stand and divided we fall. I salute you all….god bless….</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Nicholas Piere:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Testimonial: The oath I took in 2008 at the age of 23 to begin my service to my country and to defend the Constitution means so much to me. Not only am I part of a family tradition to defend my Countrymen and my Constitution I am also apart of a group that is willing to risk their own lives to protect them. When I took the oath for the first time it hit me with such pride and with such power that I felt I was a part of something more than myself for the first time in my life. Not only had it opened my eyes to what it means to be an American but it also instilled in me, a life style that I wouldn’t trade for anything.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I began to become more interested in politics and what was going on with our country, because I felt a pull, not only to defend the Constitution, but also to make sure that my Countrymen and fellow Soldiers/Veterans were not having our freedoms infringed upon. I have become more of a Patriot since I took my first oath and after I re-enlisted in 2009, that at the age of 28 I have grown so much and become more aware than the previous 22 years of my life. I take my oath to heart and even being medically discharged from the Army I continue to uphold my oath and will die protecting the Constitution and my fellow citizens if it comes to the point that even as a veteran I must stand up against a corrupt government. My oath I will uphold to my grave, for God and Country I will protect our Constitution and our fellow Countrymen.</p>

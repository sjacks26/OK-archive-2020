<content:encoded>I had a garden two years ago and the end product, I was expecting more.<br/>
Three ears of corn on one tall plant and well after you water it three months that cost more than a good price at a local store. Maybe use other water source help. Plus the chemicals and picking off the fungus that spread through out the garden. I think 5 gal pots or build a garden and bring in the soil. Some things like broccoli I believe will keep reproducing through the winter and who knows how long just get it indoors during the winter and care for it. I learned most states across the south are acidic dirt and you use lime to build the PH to 7.0 for plants not requiring acidic dirt like tomatoes peppers etc.<br/>
Use sulfur to make dirt more acidic. In the winter start your seeds in side nurturing them so they are strong and produce in spring. Canning I found is not hard at all, you may wait up to 45 min or so to hear the ping that seals it air tight. Don’t be afraid to boil those jars, I used a little over medium heat, I got scared.

<content:encoded>People ask me what will happens if the SHTF and I tell them that people will just sit there and shelter in place like the government has trained us to do. It won’t be pretty because most of us will die from starvation or disease. Prepare and practice. Buy the best equipment you can and do not try to create the illusion of security for yourself by hoarding lots of low quality crap. Having a dozen battle rifles and not knowing how to use them won’t help in reality. Having one quality rifle, learning to shoot and maintain it is priceless. Having a year’s supply of quality food (not Ramen Noodles!) and water will be paramount.

<content:encoded>I get ya Daisy, but I don’t want to be independent!!! YIKES that is blasphemy in the Liberty movement.But let me explain I am a Christian, very unpopular these days but even as a Christian when I was younger I worked very hard at being independent really wore me out. Now that I am old, I have found out that I am really not in control of much, and that is the way that the Lord designed us.First of all to be totally dependent on Him And secondly as a member of the body of Christ, I am just one member. Maybe a finger, but certainly not the Head, the Lord is the Head of the body of Christ.I highly recommend it. It takes a lot off of my shoulders and he carries it. He is my Shepard.

<content:encoded>For the past couple of years I’ve been dabbling in backyard gardening and I’ve just started growing an herb garden this year so that our family won’t have to go to Walmart all the time for food. I’m looking into hydroponics and maybe a greenhouse so I can grow food year round. I actually had quite a bit of success this year thanks to all the rain we got this spring. 
<p>I plan on going through the hunters safety course so I can learn how to hunt should we need any meat.</p>
<p>Some other skills I’d like to learn is blacksmithing and woodworking.</p>

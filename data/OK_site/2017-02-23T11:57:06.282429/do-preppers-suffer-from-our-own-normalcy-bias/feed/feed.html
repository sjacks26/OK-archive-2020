<content:encoded>Great article. I came to the same conclusion when I got to about 5 years into this and started to burn out on the “nothing is happening” thing.

<content:encoded>I see prepping as an insurance policy.  No one thinks twice about having home or auto insurance and this is the same thing to me.  You hope you don’t need it but you have it in case you do.
<p>I have a difficult time trusting people after having trusted only to have been taken advantage of or seriously hurt too many times of the years.  There’s only a handful of people I’m open to being in my group (as it stands now) and I know I need to work on that.  I know one kind of person who I definitely need in my group and that’s a green thumb, I kill every plant I touch.  I’ve got the seeds!</p>

<content:encoded>That is why Oath Keepers has a major push to establish CPT teams (Community Preparedness Teams)  Not a day goes by that I do not consider my community in all my preps, not that I even attempt to provide for the entire community my self but to encourage all to get to some level of preps and to be able to provide some level of service to the community as a whole rather than just my immediate team.

<content:encoded>I think there are levels of preparation for the time of shtf. While you can squirrel away food and water in an underground bunker, my thought is that it could run out and then where are you? So I have been looking into permaculture and learning foraging because no matter where you are, you can find nutrition in the wild. I do not broadcast my intentions regarding this for fear that bad guys would find my place (of course, I realize that some government official could take a liking to my place and take it from me on some trumped up charge) but maybe this site should partner with sites that address these topics so that we will become far better prepared after our “stash” runs out. Permies.com is a good place to start.  BTW, this site is very informative, thank you for that.

<content:encoded>Wonderful article.  Sometimes we do get wrapped up and wound up too tight. This very reason is why I believe the cpt teams are so important in starting communities back up again. Even good neighbors are withdrawn these days. Thank you for this article it reassures family and community first.

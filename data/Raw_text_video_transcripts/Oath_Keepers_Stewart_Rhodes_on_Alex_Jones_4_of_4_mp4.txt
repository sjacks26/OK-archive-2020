Alex Jones: [00:00:00] But finishing up with Stewart Rhodes of Oath Keepers dot blogspot dot com. let me tell everybody here how they're going to attack what you're dealing. It's with fear again, intimidation of police and military that speak out. But as more and more speak out, it's kind of like in those famous historical things when we have a church full of people the Revolutionary War and they'll say who stands with us. It takes about a minute and one guy steps forward and two step forward then everybody steps forward. Same thing with the Alamo in 1836. The enemy. And I bet if google this it's already out there is going to say don't sign up for this it's feds getting your name in the list and they're going to get you meaning you have to be ,I've always said this out in the open. Resisting the New World Order, speaking out, involved that we are the majority, we have to shatter that illusion that we're not the majority and we have to get past the mind game of fear. And so I think it's a great idea whether it's anonymous you write letters and post things or other people should start other oath keeper sites. more groups, lots of people. But it's good In my experience just to go past the point of no return and to commit. We're only saying we'll follow our oath. I mean that's how I got the city of Austin was saying were going to vote against the Patriot Act Repudiation. They were going to vote for the Patriot Act and keep it. And I went in there and I gave them an impassioned, the most powerful speech I probably ever given because it was directly from my soul. And I explained to them their children had no future I explained them all we were doing had no future. This continued. that all they were doing was reaffirming the Bill of Rights, Constitution. all they were doing was saying they follow their oaths of office for the city council, the police, the firemen, the workers. and that they had to do it and they did vote to overthrow it and people that were said they were going to vote against voted for. because I mean I poured everything into literally trying to reach in and grab them. you know grab you know just literally brush up against their souls. And I did and you know literally bending my will with goodness towards them. And believe me that's what humanity is all about folks. You've got power You don't know you have. It's a survival mechanism with the truth To literally be able to reach out to people. when you're telling the truth it's unstoppable. The gloveless going to pull a lot of other tricks. But I wanted to just in closing Stewart Rhodes get your take on that enemy attack angle and has that already happened. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:02:15] Well not yet. And here's what we're going to do. We're going to do the same thing that that Congressman Paul did with his campaign. We're going to let the fuse, already got officer in Houston who's volunteered to run our Facebook operation and we encourage folks to start up meet up groups and the website. We'd like people to send their testimonial to the Web sites. everyone can go there and read the testimonials and we don't screen anything we post them. They send them, we post them. And as far as. 

Alex Jones: [00:02:39] by de-centralizing, by decentralizing with meet ups it turns the enemy engine loose. where no intelligence unit no group in the government can track or trace or stop what we're doing or try dirty tricks with anybody because there's too many of us and agents that are assigned to try to infiltrate or cause problems will convert over to our side. I'd say 80 percent of the time. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:03:01] Exactly. The other thing we do, we do encourage active duty to stay anonymous unless they're short timers, are going to get out soon, or you know a few people standing up and making a convicted statement is fine but for the most part we do think it's probably wise for most of them just sort of an anonymous statement. 

Alex Jones: [00:03:17] Well that's their decision. I'm just saying most of this is anonymous. I'm saying we need more I think to go all the way. because that's what's going to shatter the illusion of the establishment. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:03:27] I agree. But it's up to them. I want them to know they can do it anonymously. They can go on any any discussion and just post an anonymous comment and we'll turn it into an anonymous post. And the veterans Definitely should stand up and be counted for sure. 

Alex Jones: [00:03:42] I mean they'll charge machine gun nest and fly helicopters into hell. But that they won't stand up when the country is imploding. No they are standing up. Certainly Sir, we commend you. the Web site again is Oath Keepers not blogspot dot com or just google. Oath Keepers and folks will find it that way. we'll talk to you in the near future. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:03:59] Awesome sir. 

Alex Jones: [00:04:00] Thank you for spending time with us, really great hearing from you.

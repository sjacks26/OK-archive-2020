<p style="text-align: justify;">The short answer to the question posed in the title of this article is: Yes. Central Banks are the enemy of the people. The following article, and video, show how insidious Central Banks, and the Bank Of International Settlements (BIS) Empire are. The BIS, IMF, and World Bank are institutions set up to gain complete monetary/financial control of the whole world. This article concerns the Russian Central Bank, which is not controlled by the Russians, but by the Central Bank Empire, as you will see. – Shorty Dawkins, Associate Editor</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Larry Bowers – 27 Dec 2014</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Last month, Yevgeny Alexeyevich Fedorov, Deputy of the Russian State Duma and the coordinator of the National Liberation Movement for restoring sovereignty of Russia (<a href="http://eafedorov.ru/" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://eafedorov.ru/', 'http://eafedorov.ru/');" target="_blank">http://eafedorov.ru/</a>), delivered an impassioned interview regarding the role of the Russian Central Bank in Western plans to displace Putin by fomenting Maidan-style protest through economic attack – all part of a larger Western fifth column attack designed to bring Russian wealth/resources (one third of the World’s wealth) under Western control.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VT085isnyB0" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VT085isnyB0', 'Youtube video description');" target="_blank">Youtube video description</a> reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“Economic hardship is being created by the foreign-controlled Bank of Russia’s monetary policies, to spread mass discontent and facilitate a Maidan in 2015 to remove Putin. So claims Evgeny Fedorov, citing the colonialist Central Bank law, established after Washington’s victory in the Cold War, and the <strong>system of fifth-column levers</strong>, methodically operated to steer the revolution.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Before we get to the interview, its worth a quick look at the nature of today’s world financial empire and its machinations. The Western Central Bank (CB) empire has grown to encompass the entire world through the US Dollar Reserve currency. The word “market” has lost its original supply/demand meaning in that markets – whether they be in precious metals, commodities, currencies, equities, derivatives, etc – are centrally controlled. These “markets” will reflect supply/demand fundamentals only if they are allowed to do so. This central control, then, becomes a powerful weapon against any country that attempts to step out of line with Western imperial interest. This is not a war of the people of the west against the people of the east. It is a war of the financial elite against the people of the world – a hallmark of the psychopathic few.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To make the point; if the Western CB empire were truly acting in the interests of Western peoples, why are we – in the West – not enjoying economic prosperity? Where is this economic prosperity outside the circles of financial elites?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Today we are seeing these CB weapons (among others) leveled against Putin, Russia, and its people. Let’s see what Federov has to say about this. A shortened version of the interview with English subtitles:</p>

<p>The English translation for easier reading:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Questioner:</strong> “I would like to understand what influences the exchange rate of the ruble, and how. On the web-site of the Central Bank, they post their accounts. One year ago our currency reserves amounted to $522B. Currently we have $454B, which means we have reduced them by around $70B. It’s not a huge difference.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“We have spent 10% of our FX reserves. Before that we spent 2 years increasing them by 10%. What does that change? It’s a normal ‘respiration’. It’s an overflow mechanism. It’s a dreadful colonialist system, but it does at least protect stability. How to develop the country? What’s needed is that the Central Bank switch to the operating principles of the central banks of the so-called ‘developed countries’. It doesn’t mean changing the people, but changing the principles. The key principle is low interest rates. Look at the English central bank, or the Japanese, or all the European ones – French, German, Portuguese, Polish, as the ECB, the American Fed – they all operate on the principles of low interest rates. They tie the currency to their national wealth and their economy, and release it into their economy, and into ours too, in the form of investments made on 0% interest financing. Our Central Bank, in their own words, operates on the principles of “developing countries and emerging markets”. It means they maintain high interest rates, while not releasing national currency within the country. Consequently, domestic investment is forbidden, only foreign investment (into Russia) is permitted. This is indicative of what they call a ‘developing nation’. We call it a sign of colonial status, i.e. this is how it is done in the colonies, where investment flows from the metropole. This is how a colonialist economic system is set up.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Questioner:</strong> ” The web-site of the Central Bank shows the interest rates for their operations. It’s all documented, including the changes in the various interest rates. What is interesting is that I looked at the long-term financing. For some reason all forms of credit are given either for one day or here we have three months. But anything longer than that, say for two years, is a credit secured with gold, i.e. if I have gold, then they will give me money for two years. Or else credit secured with financial assets or by a guarantor, and so on.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“That means there is no credit. If you have gold, then that already is money. In other words, you have money, and they have allowed you to take out credit, and pay interest on this credit for the money you gave to the creditor. Well, that’s not credit. That’s just exchanging securities. In exchange for your gold, you got credit, as they call it, which you have to pay back, moreover with interest. You could just sell your gold, and receive the same – without any credit. You can’t call this credit. Why is it for one day? Very simple: our Central Bank has organized the operation of banks only for cash-flow, i.e. to facilitate daily operations. Let’s say you’re a retailer. You want to sell some refrigerators. First you have to buy the refrigerators. So you took out credit, bought the refrigerators, sold them a week later, then re-paid the credit. <strong>But that’s not investment</strong>. Investment means construction. And that takes 3-5 years. If you want to build something, you have to go a German bank, or a Polish or Czech or Portuguese one. They would – before the sanctions – give you credit at 4-6% interest. They issued credits for Russia at 4%. But a Russian bank cannot do that. So we allow Portuguese banks to invest in Russia at 4% interest, which they do. We have $700B of foreign borrowing in this country, including for the purpose of investment. But Russian banks are not allowed to do so – it’s institutionalized. In effect, <strong>the Central Bank forbids Russia from investing in herself. </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“Let that be clear. It only exists for cash-flow, not for investment. In order to launch investment domestically, one very simple thing has to be done – lower the interest rates to zero. I.e. align the Russian banking system with, say, the Czech or Portuguese or Greek one, or whatever – what would be the most pejorative in terms of credit systems, say … Romanian. It’s the same in all Eastern European countries. Align us with the Romanian economy, by allowing Russian banks to invest money in the country. Lower the interest rates to zero, scrap Basel III, reduce the yield to 2-3%, as they have done. This is nothing new. There will come a stream of money into the country. We already worked out that this stream of money would be minimum 25 trillion rubles. Now with the ruble falling it’s 30 trillion. Why 25-30Tr – and that’s only in the first year? Because that is the current volume of foreign credit, i.e. 25-30Tr rubles is the equivalent of the $700B of foreign credits that we have. This amount could of course be emitted by the Central Bank – <strong>not additional money into the economy, but substitution for foreign credits.</strong></p>

<p>“Obama calls Kalamazoo officials over shootings, pleads for more gun laws,” <a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/feb/22/obama-calls-kalamazoo-mi-officials-over-shootings/" target="_blank">The Washington Times reported Monday</a>. “Clearly we’re going to need to do more if we’re going to keep innocent Americans safe,” Obama proclaimed at a White House meeting with governors. “[We need] to partner and think about what we can do in a common-sense way, in a bipartisan way, without some of the ideological rhetoric that so often surrounds that issue.”</p>
<p>Like what?  Notice he doesn’t get all that specific?</p>
<p>What he’s doing is playing off long-time fellow traveler Rahm Emanuel’s advice to “never let a serious crisis go to waste.” That and he’s blood dancing.</p>
<p>Because the fact is, at this writing, and certainly at the time Obama made his opportunistic comments, we know very little about the killer and his twisted motives. And because relevant social media pages have been disabled, we’re now dependent on what the police tell us and how the media parrots statements back to us for further information to be revealed.</p>
<p>That’s not necessarily the most reliable way for the truth to come out, as some of us have <a href="http://waronguns.blogspot.com/2016/02/countercurrents.html" target="_blank">found out the hard way</a>. But seeing as how that’s all we’ve got right now, here are two extremely relevant pieces of information about the suspect:</p>
<p>He has <a href="http://www.wcvb.com/national/kalamazoo-rampage-who-is-jason-brian-dalton/38121322" target="_blank">no criminal record</a>.</p>
<p>He passed an <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2016/02/21/what-the-bizarre-nature-of-the-kalamazoo-shooting-says-about-ubers-background-checks/" target="_blank">employment background check</a>.</p>
<p>That means he would have passed a “universal background check” to buy a gun. That’s one of the big ticket items Obama is pushing right now, and it would have been useless here (as well as without registration, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141230124923/http:/www.nraila.org/media/10883516/nij-gun-policy-memo.pdf">per the National Institute of Justice</a>). It’s what Michael Bloomberg has made the centerpiece of his state-by-state march to the sea.</p>
<p>But, as happens every time the monopoly of violence sharks smell blood in the water, the cry goes out that “<a href="http://dailycaller.com/2015/09/18/something-must-be-done/" target="_blank">Something must be done!</a>”</p>
<p>In this case, since the killer was not committed to an institution and segregated from society, and since he reportedly used a semiautomatic handgun, two things that have not been implemented – yet – would be to ban handguns and to require all prospective firearm purchasers pass a comprehensive battery of mental health tests to prove they are qualified before being allowed to take possession.</p>
<p>Who doubts Obama wouldn’t love to be able to impose those requirements? And does either of those preconditions sound like “unalienable” or “shall not be infringed” to you?</p>
<p>All this talk about “common sense gun safety laws” is just that. None of it is common sense and none of it makes anyone but criminals—both freelance and those working for the government – any safer. The end game is citizen disarmament and those imposing it will take it in pieces when they can get it, and then move on to the next target of opportunity.</p>
<p>Anyone who tells you otherwise is either an idiot or a liar, noting there’s nothing stopping them from being both.</p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>This SHTF Intelligence course</strong> is a two-day course that prepares students to gather intelligence information for post-SHTF community security. Each training day begins at 0900 and ends approximately 1700 (5pm), with a mid-day lunch break. Over the course of two days, we cover the following topics:</p>
<p>– threat identification<br/>
– threat analysis<br/>
– understanding the threat environment and you<br/>
– understanding the community security mission<br/>
– community security strategies<br/>
– the Intelligence Cycle<br/>
– how to gather intelligence information (specific for your locale)<br/>
– how to analyze incoming intelligence information<br/>
– how to set up a community intelligence section<br/>
– the fundamental tasks and responsibilities of the intelligence section<br/>
– Intelligence Preparation of the Battlefield &amp; Community<br/>
– Area Assessments</p>
<p><strong>We begin the course</strong> by exploring and analyzing the threats we’re likely to face during a SHTF scenario, and discuss the threat environment and mission of community security. Then we get into how we should configure our intelligence section. This is the ‘brain’ of community security. We work on understanding our SHTF mission and we conduct some threat analysis to identify what we should be preparing for. Then we build our intelligence team around the mission.</p>
<p><strong>You’ll have</strong> the opportunity to do group or individual work where you’ll navigate the Intelligence Cycle and complete relevant intelligence products for your community. We discuss Intelligence collection and then we collect. Then we discuss Intelligence analysis and we then analyze incoming information in order to produce intelligence. Over two days, you should be able to get a great start on your Area Assessment and complete the basics of Intelligence Preparation of the Battlefield &amp; Community.</p>
<p><strong>What we do</strong> over these two days is train students to become the ‘intelligence officer’ during any SHTF scenario. The student will have an understanding of his/her roles and responsibilities, be able to direct collection and then produce threat intelligence. That’s our number one goal, by the way, for any SHTF scenario — produce early warning and threat intelligence.</p>

<p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><a href="http://katu.com/news/local/grant-county-sheriff-glenn-palmer-accused-of-helping-refuge-occupiers" target="_blank">This article comes from KATU TV News</a></span></p>
<p>By Bob Heye, KATU News Friday, February 19th 2016</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">PORTLAND, Ore. — Grant County’s sheriff is under state investigation after complaints about his conduct during the standoff at the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There were apparently concerns Sheriff Glenn Palmer might have been passing information to the occupiers during the standoff.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He was apparently kept out of the loop about plans for the traffic stop that led to the arrest of Ammon Bundy and several others, and the shooting death of LaVoy Finicum.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Now Palmer is facing more than half a dozen complaints – some from law enforcement agencies – about his actions during the standoff.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Palmer is outspoken about gun rights and is sympathetic to anti-government protesters. The sheriff’s office even <a href="http://grantcountysherifforegon.com/" target="_blank"><span style="color: #0000ff;">posted a video clip</span></a> featuring Palmer on its website.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“People are tired of the oppression from their government,” he says in the video. “And at some point it’s got to stop or we’re gonna have problems.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">But complaints, including one from the John Day 911 center and John Day’s chief of police to Oregon’s Department of Public Safety Standards and Training claim Palmer stepped over the line during the refuge standoff, helping keep the militia informed of law enforcement efforts to end the occupation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“We received a number of complaints from residents of Grant County alleging misconduct, or potential misconduct, by Sheriff Palmer,” said Eriks Gabliks, spokesman for DPSST.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The DPSST replied to the complaints by saying its preliminary investigation shows Palmer’s actions “may violate the Board’s certification standards.” That means Palmer could be stripped of his state law enforcement credentials.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“They appear to be very serious and require that we look into them, and we’ve asked the Oregon Department of Justice to conduct the investigation on our behalf,” Gabliks said.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It wouldn’t be the first time the DPSST has taken action against a sheriff. In 2008, Multnomah County Sheriff Bernie Giusto resigned as the DPSST was wrapping up an investigation into alleged misconduct by Giusto.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Palmer declined KATU’s request for comment.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The DPSST said it is not clear how long the Oregon Department of Justice investigation into Palmer’s actions may take.</p>

<p><strong>Gregg O’Neill:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Testimonial: Hi, this is Greg O’Neill, I served with honor for nine years of active duty, with a hitch in the Navy (70-74), serving in the Tonkin Gulf, building bombs on the attack aircraft carrier, KITTY HAWK (CVA-63), and later in the Army (79-83) after a drunken bosun’s mate chief recruiter took off on leave, putting my record jacket in his locked drawer, which caused me to miss my window of opportunity to get back in the Navy, so I joined the Army. Back in 70 – 74 they did not have PTSD diagnosed, so we faced being pariahs when we went home from the “War” as they call it now. I dealt with guilt for building bombs to kill innocent folk in Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos, when we were ordered to be silent about what we were doing, in violation of international agreements, bombing countries we didn’t declare war on, including Vietnam, North and South.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I am not ashamed of taking the oath to serve our country, to defend our constitution against enemies, foreign and domestic, but now I’m disgusted to see those enemies in DC, and in the Pentagon, who serve corporate interests over the needs of our country, and states, they have forgotten who they are serving. Our young people are in Iraq and Afghanistan, not to defend our nation, but to serve the OIL industry, and the drug runners making money from their growing poppies in Afghanistan, and making heroin from selling it to junkies here in the States. There is a company in England now making synthetic fuels, identical to those refined from crude oil, extracting hydrogen and carbon from the air to make hydrocarbons, why aren’t we using that instead of serving Big OIL?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When I attended OCS Class 1-80 at Fort Benning we were told to watch the  senior officers coming out of command classes at Infantry Hall, for them to serve as our role models, what a bunch of slackers, out of shape duffel bags, fat boys, promoted with over inflated efficiency reports from their brown nosing commanding officers. How many of them have made money from the corporations in the military industrial complex that make weapons systems, and supplies, for our armed forces?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We know what the problems are, now what do we do about it? I, and my friends, have access to advanced technologies to provide every state with abundant clean energy, food and water, we are up against a wall put there by those who would rather kill us than to see these technologies used to put our country back to work, and on our feet again to stand tall, and proud of our nation, self-reliant, and independent as we once were.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I’d love to see other vets and active duty personnel ending the “wars” in other countries, and getting to work here to turn our country around, and put back on track to being a country governed by our constitutional law, free of tyranny from DC, and the corrupt feds. Tell the slackers at the Pentagon to do what is right, and to do what they know needs doing NOW.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Testimonial: Anyone of moral character would want Stewart Rhodes to be their team mate. He is a passionate team player and leader. He led a field event in Oregon several years ago which I was able to video tape. I have videoed other events he has done here. He is an inspiration through his behavior. The character trait I enjoy most is his forthrightness. When something is happening the whole team is kept aware. Our biggest challenge as a team is to develop in each of our communities an appreciation for who Oath Keepers really is instead of who the old media say we are. I ignore the accusations, I just keep reaching, teaching and inspiring others.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">————————————————————————————————————————————</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Judy Sue Christenson:</strong></p>
<p>Testimonial: To Stewart Rhodes and all who stand for Liberty:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I wish to express my husband’s and my deepest respect and profound gratitude for all you are doing and have done. We are all one in the Spirit of the 56 who signed the Declaration of Independence, the greatest Master Mind in history. Your courage and others’ is inspiring a nation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">May each of us be guided by God. I have been keeping a virtually perpetual prayer vigil for several years that increased in intensity prior to the Bundy situation 2014. One such time was the day before and exactly during that intense confrontation day. Archangel Michael is the patron saint of all who work to protect and defend Liberty and he has stepped through the veil to save many lives including World War I and World War II. I will continue a fiery vigil until the Hammond/Bundy situation is resolved by God’s grace with no harm to life and we restore Liberty in America and the planet. We pray that much is mitigated in the current situation and I know many are praying and acting as guided.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">God is in charge and I believe we are in the midst of George Washington’s third vision. I also believe and hope that victory is nigh in the not far distant future, and the fire of freedom and Liberty is greatly accelerating in America in these critical times. Prophecy is given so that it can be mitigated or averted by actions and prayers.</p>
<p>George Washington’s Third Vision:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“And, I dimly saw these vast armies devastate the whole country and burn the villages, towns and cities that I beheld springing up…..’Son of the Republic, look and learn.’ When the voice had ceased, the dark shadowy angel placed his trumpet once more to his mouth, and blew a long and fearful blast.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“’Instantly a light as of a thousand suns shone down from above me, and pierced and broke into fragments the dark cloud which enveloped America. At the same moment the angel upon whose head still shone the word Union, and who bore our national flag in one hand and a sword in the other, descended from the heavens attended by legions of white spirits. These joined the inhabitants of America, who I perceived were well-nigh overcome, but who immediately taking courage again, closed up their broken ranks and renewed the battle……</p>
<p>“’Instantly the dark cloud rolled back, together with the armies it had brought, leaving the inhabitants of the land victorious…</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“’…the bright angel, planting the azure standard he had brought in the midst of them, cried with a loud voice: “While the stars remain, and the heavens send down dew upon the earth, so long shall the Union last.” And taking from his brow thecrown on which blazoned the word ‘Union,’ he placed it upon the Standard, while the<br/>
people, kneeling down, said, ‘Amen.'”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I will sign off with The American’s Creed by William Tyler Page:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“I believe in the United States of America as a government of the people, by the people, for the people, whose just powers are derived from the consent of the governed; a democracy in a Republic; a sovereign Nation of many sovereign States; a perfect Union, one and inseparable; established upon those principles of freedom, equality, justice and humanity for which American patriots sacrificed their lives and fortunes.</p>
<p>“I therefore believe it is my duty to my Country to love it; to support its Constitution; to obey its laws; to respect its flag; and to defend it against all enemies.”</p>
<p>I would add to only support laws in alignment with the Constitution and God’s natural laws.<br/>
May God Bless our endeavors.<br/>
With deep respect,<br/>
Judy Sue Christenson</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Tom McMillan:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Testimonial: I just got off the phone with a friend who is a member of the Jackson County Community Preparedness Team, here in the Smoky Mountains of Western North Carolina. I’m a Associate Member of Oath Keepers and also a member of JCCPT. The topic of Civil War came up so I proceeded to tell the story of my family the McMillan’s, it goes like this.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Back in the 1970’s me and my father, John B. McMillan, were reading Mother Earth News and saw the section about, The Economic Outlook. So off to back to the land world we went. We bought a beautiful 30 acre farm that was in the family at one time in Barrow, County, Georgia. After several years of bringing the old home place back upscale we had a wonderful place. It was a old dairy farm with lots of outbuilding, Lakes, pastures and woodlots.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So, to keep a long story short, this standoff in Oregon has some of us remembering the damage done to families when confronted with the task of standing up for our rights as Americans. My father said, per Art. 1, Sec. 10, of the US Constitution, that the only thing that’s legal tender is gold and silver coin. So, all his debts were null and void. That brought the Law Enforcement to the door… and this was Sept. 30th, 1982, his birthday. A SWAT team from Athens Georgia came on the farm and shot him 18 times for Terrorist Threats. They blocked off all the roads in the area and I was the first one of the family to arrive on the scene since it was his birthday. I had worked with him in Automotive Sales Promotion for 14 years in Atlanta, Georgia, where he was well known for being on TV for Central Chevrolet in the sixties.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So, we got Bobby Lee Cook to represent us in a Civil Rights Violation…since it’s Martin Luther King day civil stories work. The wrongful death, excessive force charges went on for several years until we settled out of court with a Gag Rule on the case…I can’t find any information on it. So, they talked about it on the Phil Donahue show in relation to Gordan Kahl who was a tax protester out west and took out some US Marshalls and the Sheriff.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So now at 64, disabled but still upright I’m wondering if this Oregon action is effecting other people of the US Patriot Community. Now I’m looking for a battle rifle, AR, some camo and some people to hang out with. Both my grown children who lived on the farm are disabled now. I hope the checks keep coming…but don’t let them say disabled people are exempt of the 2nd Amendment.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Blessings, Tom McMillan , Whittier, NC</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Testimonial: I am a veteran. I fought for the freedom of people I did not know and whose language I do not speak for 2 years. Do you think for one minute I would give up my freedom? Not bloody likely!</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Kyle Jennings:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Testimonial: Born and raised in Dallas, Texas. Joined the military at 18 did basic at Fort Sill Oklahoma; nearly froze to death, then went on to Fort Hood. Served under 3 star Gen. Ulmer in the first and seventy seventh cavalry in field artillery on the 109 howitzer got lucky and got teamed up with best group of green privates anywhere. We quickly became number 1 gun in world history and received 2 letters of accommodation in our files from General Ulmer for putting more rounds on time and on target than had ever been done.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Before I took my life-time oath I pledged allegiance to the flag of the United States of America.I had an uncle die in WW2 I never got to meet and 3 older cousins that made it home from Vietnam thank God. So when I swore to protect and serve my American brothers and sisters I meant for life .I never thought I would see the greatest nation on earth become the most hated and evil murdering bunch of Satanic homosexual and pedophiles running our government and I can document everything I say. I never lie to anyone. There are two things they can’t take away from us: one is your education, if you were fortunate enough to get to college, and next, and most important, is your word! I gave my word, and I’m giving it again, to give my life if necessary, defending those that aren’t capable, and taking my honorable country back from the criminals that have disgraced all the soldiers that made this country great may Almighty God be with us when the battle starts. This is the last time</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I will say this as well.”BARACK OBAMA I DEMAND THAT YOU IMMEDIATELY CEASE AND DESIST AND TURN YOURSELF IN FOR TREASON AS WELL AS CONSPIRACY. WHEN YOU ORDERED THE 2 UNDER COVER FBI(FUMBLING BUNCH of IDIOTS)AGENTS TO DRESS AS MILITIA MEMBERS IN OREGON AND TERRORIZE THE CITIZENS AS WELL AS THE NUMEROUS OTHER CRIMES YOU HAVE COMMITTED. IF YOU DO NOT, THEN WHEN THIS STARTS AND YOU DECLARE WAR, THAT’S WHEN I DECLARE WAR ON YOU AND I WILL COME AND ARREST YOU PERSONALLY</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Testimonial: I have taken the oath on three occasions and seen 19 different countries. The second time I took the oath, I reflected upon it as very just. The third time I took oath, I was mentally prepared and strong in the convictions of the oath. I look at our Constitution as solid as granite and a standard to act upon in reverent caution.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The reason for seeing these other countries was to help correct other countries that abused their citizens or that of other countries. We have many dead soldiers buried abroad that fought for the freedoms in our constitution we hold dear.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There are no dead foreign soldiers buried in the US from other countries that was here to free our citizens.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I remember the days of John F Kennedy running for president quoting, “Ask not what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for your country.” The actions of government with its people is in complete opposite today. President Kennedy views would be a far right extremist today.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I have no problem defending the Constitution, especially when I see gross abuse of other people and positions of office that have taken the same oath.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Constitution is my rock.</p>

<p class="CSSBody"><em>This article was written by Luis R. Miranda and originally published at <a href="http://real-agenda.com/">The Real Agenda</a></em></p>
<p class="CSSBody">Political correctness is key in centralizing power. That is why more and more people, who are purportedly liberal or progressive, are all out to curve people’s choice of words and even thoughts.</p>
<p class="CSSBody">The growing number of people who think that individuals’ speech should be regulated by the government to avoid politically incorrect statements are persons who have been hiding under the shadows for a long time as victims of the hatred they feel for their own lives.</p>
<p class="CSSBody">People who feel entitled to restrain someone else’s speech are what I have come to call the “perpetually offended”. Scholars and academics who analyze the current move towards intellectual slavery as well as people who are well-aware about the agenda behind enforcing politically correct speech have found very insightful information about the “thought police”.</p>
<p class="CSSBody">The real agenda behind politically correct speech and intolerance towards a diversity of ideas is that political correctness is a manipulative tool for centralizing power. Just as that that who counts the votes is more important than those who vote, and just as those who control food can control a population; controlling speech enables diversity-of-thought haters to take over people’s mental abilities.</p>
<p class="CSSBody">“The left is definitely using these mass manipulation tactics,” says Stella Morabito, a former intelligence analyst. She says that conservatives have no clue about the propaganda manipulation tactics and that most people in the <em>left</em> aren’t even knowledgeable enough to understand it. They just go along with the flow.</p>
<p class="CSSBody">According to Morabito, mass ignorance is key in bringing about the type of society we live in and the kind of environment the Elite has planned for us all. She says that the very human fear of being rejected is one of the pillars of the current move to divide social groups that would otherwise make strong links among individuals.</p>
<p class="CSSBody">In other words, people, who for a long time have felt left out, are the most likely to open their ears and join so-called liberal movements. Unsuspecting supporters of Feminism, LGBT, Gender Equality and other left-wing movements are included in the group of potential victims.</p>
<p class="CSSBody">Recently, <a href="http://real-agenda.com/ted-cruz-psyop/">Thierry Meyssan explained</a> how companies that are in the business of setting up campaigns and movements work in favor of a candidate or an idea to make it mainstream.</p>
<p class="CSSBody">Separating society into small groups and making those groups go after each other is paramount if the Elite is to be successful in destroying human identity. Language manipulation through the imposition of a veil of semantic fog has become a powerful tool in turning individuals into self-censoring, mindless and easily controllable beings.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="CSSRed"><em>“If we revisit the example of the “quick public opinion shift” on same-sex marriage — which was basically an implausible idea 15 years ago — we might ask: why did the activist push for it became so fast and furious? Couldn’t the idea withstand real public discourse and stand on its own merits without extreme public shaming of anyone who had doubts?  Couldn’t it have come about through the legislative process without an activist judge overturning the referendum results of an entire state? Or Supreme Court justices claiming that those opposed were filled with “animus?”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="CSSBody">The effective capture of society is done via the most important communication outlets, including the media, Hollywood, pop culture, academia, religion, and more recently, the family. “If you push an agenda to centralize power, you need mass ignorance and effective propaganda,” Morabito explains.</p>
<p class="CSSBody">The Elite’s agenda to centralize power and control is brought upon society in disguise, hidden behind messages of fairness, equality and anyone who dares speak their mind against the brainwashing movement is immediately accused of driving homophobic speech, racism, anti-Semitism, of being a womanizer, a holocaust denier, a ‘flat earther’ and so on.</p>
<p class="CSSBody">“Opinion cascades, particularly on ideas that seem implausible — rely on a great deal of propaganda and agitation, through political correctness. They are very fragile things.  The survival of such opinion cascades requires a lot of tweaking and teasing and discipline and balancing acts by those pushing them, including activists, politicians, celebrities, academics, media moguls.” That is precisely how the masses of the perpetually offended get mobilized. In simple terms, the Elite gives the naked Emperor a new set of clothes that only the brainwashed are able to see. In reality, though, the Emperor is naked. “It’s all about conditioning,” says Morabito.</p>
<p class="CSSBody">When propaganda alone does not work, the Elite resources to PsyOps. Psychological Operations are far more complex than propaganda, which is aimed only at deforming the perception of reality. This tactic is often used to convince people who have resisted the propaganda and to reinforce the thoughts of those who are already in the bag.</p>
<p class="CSSBody">Companies like SCL, whose business is to profile human drones and zombies who feel left out, offer their services which include “using behavioural techniques in order to fabricate a political party which would sweep its client to power.” Psychologists in these company and others “define the profile type of the sincere and manipulable militant”. Later, data is collected, usually by <a href="http://www.voltairenet.org/article190187.html#nb7">paying off companies like Amazon</a> to obtain data from target populations. An analysis is conducted to find out who best fits the profile. Based on this information, the company designs a message that will convince people to support their idea or personality.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="CSSRed">“Through propaganda and agitation, you get behavior modification on a mass scale. Yesterday it was same sex marriage.  Today it is transgenderism.  Tomorrow? It could be absolutely anything at all.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="CSSBody">The techniques used to manipulate masses of people come directly from academia, where specific terms are employed to name mass manipulation tactics. “<a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=138144">Availability cascade</a>” is an academic term that basically has to do with manufacturing public opinion approval for a policy of some sort.  Any kind of policy at all,” explains Morabito.</p>
<p class="CSSBody">Brainwashing the masses is as easy as injecting a new idea into public discourse, to turn it available to the target masses. Fake populism is one of the best tools to manipulate the public, which is why politicians have attempted to master populism for a long time. The goal is to “saturate the media with praises for the idea, and add just the right celebrity endorsements,” says Morabito. We saw this tactic during Super Bowl 50’s halftime show, where <a href="https://t.co/ViAKwnCNRO">performers used explicit visual tools</a> to send a message to the dissatisfied masses of people who were tuning into the broadcast.</p>
<p class="CSSBody">The dangers of falling for the political correctness gimmick is that there is no way back. Once people fall in the deep hole of thought control, there is little to do to bring them back. We need far more conversations about how political correctness – i.e., coercive thought reform – undermines our ability to think independently,” warns Morabito. She agrees with the fact that once people’s ability to think freely is gone, they become ideal subjects of manipulation. “On a mass scale, this is very bad for any society.”</p>
<p class="CSSBody">The question is, how do we prevent ourselves and other people who live around us from being manipulated? How can we build a shield of protection against coercive thought reform? The answer is, by learning more about it, by learning how to identify it and how to reject it. Once we are able to create a shield, it is possible to go out and help others. Put it simply, it is necessary to hack-proof your mind.</p>
<p class="CSSBody">In this article, <a href="http://thefederalist.com/2015/12/01/10-resources-for-hack-proofing-your-mind/">the author provides a list of books</a> that will help anyone build the shield, keep it strong and elevate its intellectual ammo to go out and have conversations about how political correctness threatens the free human mind.</p>

<p><em>This article was written by Brandon Smith and originally published at <a href="http://www.alt-market.com/articles/2810-markets-ignore-fundamentals-and-chase-headlines-because-they-are-dying">Alt-Market.com</a></em></p>
<p>Normalcy bias is a rather horrifying thing. It is so frightening because it is so final; much like death, there is simply no coming back. Rather than a physical death, normalcy bias represents the death of reason and simple observation. It is the death of the mind and cognitive thought instead of the death of the body.</p>
<p>Ever since the derivatives collapse of 2008 the public has been regaled with wondrous stories of recovery in the mainstream to the point that such fantasies have become the “new normal”. These are grand tales of the daring heroics of central bankers who “saved us all” from impending collapse through gutsy monetary policy and no-holds-barred stimulus measures.</p>
<p>Alternative economists have not been so easy to dazzle. Most of us found that the recovery narrative lacked a certain something; namely hard data that took the wider picture into account. It seemed as though the mainstream media (MSM) as well as the establishment was attempting to cherry-pick certain numbers out of context while demanding we ignore all other factors as “unimportant.”</p>
<p>We just haven’t been buying into the magic show of the so called “professional economists” and the academics, and now that the real and very unstable fiscal reality of the world is bubbling to the surface, the general public will begin to see why we have been right all these years and the MSM has been utterly wrong.</p>
<p>Mainstream economists have done absolutely nothing in the way of investigative journalism and have instead joined a chorus cheerleading for the false narrative, singing a siren’s song of misinterpreted statistics and outright lies drawing the masses ever nearer to the deadly shoals of financial crisis.</p>
<p>Why do they do this? Are they part of some vast conspiracy to mislead the public?</p>
<p>Not necessarily. While central banks and governments have indeed been proven time and again to collude in efforts to cover up financial dangers, most economists in the media are simply greedy and ignorant. You have to remember, they have a considerable stake in this game.</p>
<p>Many mainstream economists tend to have sizable investment portfolios and they base their careers partly on the successes they garner in the annual profits they accumulate playing the equities roulette. They also have invested so much of their public image into their pro-market and recovery arguments that there is no going back. That is to say, they have a personal interest in using their positions in the media to engineer positive market psychology (if they are able) so that their portfolios remain profitable. Not to mention, their professional image is at stake if they ever acknowledge that they were wrong for so long about the underlying health of the real economy.</p>
<p>This atmosphere of deluded self interest also generates a cult-like collectivist attitude. There is a lot of mutual back scratching and mutual ego stroking in the MSM; a kind of inbred conduit of regurgitated arguments and unoriginal talking points, and people in the club rarely step out of line because they not only hurt their own investment future and career, they also hurt everyone in their professional circles.  Meaning, no more cocktail party invitations to the Forbes rumpus room…</p>
<p>This is not to say that I am excusing their self interested lies and disinformation. I think that many of these people should be tarred and feathered in a public square for attempting to dissuade the public from preparing in a practical way for severe economic instability. I do not think they see themselves as being responsible to the people who actually take their nonsense seriously and their attitude needs adjustment. I am only explaining how it is possible for an entire profession of supposed “experts” to be so wrong so often. Mainstream financial analysts WANT to believe their own lies as much as many in the public want to believe them.</p>
<p>Like I said, normalcy bias is a rather horrifying thing.</p>
<p>One of the root pieces of disinformation in the mainstream that feeds all other lies is the disinformation surrounding falling global demand. MSM pundits cannot and will never fully admit to the cold hard reality of collapsing demand within the global economy. If they are forced to admit to falling demand, then the facade of a steady or recovering U.S. economy crumbles.</p>
<p>I covered the facts behind falling global demand for raw goods and consumer goods last year in part one of my six-part article series, <a href="http://www.alt-market.com/articles/2528-one-last-look-at-the-real-economy-before-it-implodes-part-1">‘One Last Look At The Real Economy Before It Implodes.’ </a> The hard evidence and numbers I presented have only become more important in recent months.</p>
<p>For example, U.S. inventories are building and freight shipments are <a href="http://www.joc.com/economy-watch/us-economy-news/us-inventories-build-freight-shipments-decline_20160212.html" target="_blank">declining</a> in the U.S. as retailers cite falling demand for goods as the primary culprit. Official retail sales numbers for the holiday season of 2015 have come in flat. When one takes into account real inflation in prices, consumer sales are actually far in the negative. According to the more accurate methods the U.S. government used to use in their calculations of CPI in the 1980’s, we are looking at annual price inflation rate of around <a href="http://www.shadowstats.com/alternate_data/inflation-charts" target="_blank">7%. </a>Price inflation does not necessarily equal improved sales.</p>
<p>Energy usage has been crushed since 2008. Despite a growing population and supposedly a growing economic system, oil consumption in 2014 <a href="http://www.weforum.org/agenda/2015/07/the-surprising-decline-in-us-petroleum-consumption/" target="_blank">according to the World Economic Forum</a> dropped to levels not seen since 1997.</p>
<p>This is the exact opposite of what should be happening and it is the opposite of mainstream projections for oil consumption made back in 2003. This is why inventories and storage for oil across the globe are reaching capacity in a manner never seen before. American demand for oil is not growing exponentially as expected because Americans cannot afford to support such growth anymore. Falling energy demand at these extreme levels is an undeniable indicator of a failing economic system.</p>
<p>Of course, mainstream economists in their desperation to keep market psychology rolling forward and the equities casino producing profits seek to spin this problem as an “oversupply” issue rather than a demand issue. And this is where the disparity in their arguments begins to bleed through.</p>
<p>Here is the problem presented in the mainstream; what came first, the chicken or the egg? Did falling demand lead to oversupply and thus a fall in prices? Or, is demand remaining steady and is overproduction the cause of falling prices?  Yes, let’s confuse the issue instead of looking at the obvious.</p>
<p>As already linked above, it was falling demand which came first in 2008, and demand which continues to fall in relation to past trends. Have producers failed to reduce oil production to match falling demand? Yes. But this does not change the fact that oil demand today is well below levels needed to sustain the kind of economic growth markets have come to expect. Mainstream economists attempt to distract by hyper-focusing on supply, or twisting the discussion into an either/or scenario. Either it is a supply problem, or it is a demand problem, and they assert it is only a supply problem. This is not reality.</p>
<p>In fact, both can and often do exist at the same time, though one problem usually feeds the other. Falling demand does tend to result in oversupply in any particular sector of the economy. The bottom line, however, is that in our current crisis demand is the driving force and supply is a secondary issue. Supply is NOT the driving force behind the volatility in oil markets. Period.</p>
<p>This same chicken and egg distraction rears its ugly head in discussions on shipping markets as well.</p>
<p>The mainstream claim that the historic implosion of the Baltic Dry Index is nothing more than a problem of “too many ships” operating in the cargo market has been throttled, dissected and debunked so many times that you would think that it is surely dead. But the lie just will not die.</p>
<p>Mainstream propaganda houses like <a href="http://www.economist.com/blogs/economist-explains/2015/03/economist-explains-7" target="_blank">The Economist </a>and <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2016/02/10/zero-hedge-still-wrong-on-maersk-global-trade-and-the-baltic-dry/#397e7a3f509f" target="_blank">Forbes</a> continue to produce articles on a regular basis which deny the issue of falling demand for raw goods and claim that oversupply of vessels is the root cause of the BDI losing around 98 percent of its value since its highs in 2008.</p>
<p>I haven’t seen any of these articles offer actual stats or evidence to back their claims that oversupply of ships is the culprit and that demand is not a legitimate issue. But beyond that, why does the mainstream seem so hell bent on dismissing the BDI as a reliable economic indicator? Well, because shipping rates fall when demand falls, thus, when the BDI falls, it signals a lack of global demand. This is a fact they refuse to accept. When the BDI falls by 98 percent since the 2008 highs preceding the derivatives crisis, this signals a disaster in the making.</p>
<p>So, let’s stamp out the “too many ships came first” disinformation once and for all, shall we?</p>
<p>Shipping companies like <a href="http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/trade-crisis-maersk-warns-abnormal-conditions-global-economy-are-much-worse-2008-1543085" target="_blank">Maersk Lines</a> have already publicly admitted that <a href="http://nypost.com/2016/02/13/blame-less-trading-for-freight-shippings-harsh-decline/" target="_blank">falling global demand</a> is the core problem behind falling rates and that supply is a secondary driver. They view the current financial crisis to be “worse than 2008”.</p>
<p>The fact that the largest shipping company in the world is warning of falling demand does not seem to be having any effect on the mainstream talking heads, though.</p>
<p>So, what do major shipping companies do when demand is falling and too many ships are operating on the market? Do they field those ships anyway and drive rates down even further? No, that makes no sense.</p>
<p>What companies do is either leave ships idle in port or scrap them. According to BIMCO (Baltic And International Maritime Council), 2015 was the busiest year since 2012 for the scrapping of older ships to make way for new arrivals. This process of scrapping ships or storing them idle destroys the argument that too many ships are driving falling rates in the BDI. In fact, as chief shipping analyst <a href="https://www.bimco.org/Reports/Market_Analysis/2015/0507_Dry_bulk_demo_story.aspx" target="_blank">Peter Sand of BIMCO stated</a> last year:</p>
<p><strong>“The increase in Capesize scrapping comes at a much needed time for the market. Looking at the development so far this year the fleet growth has actually been negative, with a reduction of 0.8 %.”</strong></p>
<p>I hope the garbage peddlers at Forbes and The Economist caught that — NEGATIVE growth of ship supply, not massive over-growth of ship supply. The scrapping increase was also across the board for other models of ships, not just the Capsize, and the increase of cargo capacity by new ships has been negligible.  Yet, shipping rates continue to plummet to historical lows.  Only falling demand, as Maersk Lines admits, explains the crash of the BDI in light of this information.</p>
<p>China in particular has been offering considerable incentives to those companies that do scrap older ships, to the point that some are even <a href="http://worldmaritimenews.com/archives/179270/bimco-chinas-scrapping-of-younger-ships-may-increase-newbuilds/" target="_blank">scrapping semi-new ships</a> in order to cash in.</p>
<p>Now, this is not to say there is not an “oversupply” of ships. There are indeed many ships within cargo fleets that are not in operation. But again, this is because demand has declined so completely that even with increased scrapping and idling, shipping companies cannot keep up.  Falling demand OCCURRED FIRST, and oversupply is nothing more than a symptom of this root problem.</p>
<p>So, mainstream hacks, can we please put the “too many ships” nonsense to rest and get on with a real discussion on obvious issues of demand?  Stop focusing on the symptoms and examine the cause for once.</p>
<p>These are just a few of the hundreds of fundamental problems plaguing the global economy today, and they are all problems that the mainstream continues to ignore or dismiss out of hand. Which brings us to the now accelerating volatility in stock markets.</p>
<p>Stock markets are crashing, there is no other way to paint it. They are crashing incrementally, but crashing nonetheless. When you have violent swings in equities and commodities between 5 percent and 10 percent a day, then something is very wrong with your economy and has been wrong for some time. If global consumption and demand were really steady or growing, then you would not see the kind of systemic backlash in the financial system that we are now seeing.  If companies listed on the Dow were making legitimate profits due to a healthy consumer base and enjoying solid expansion, stocks would not be increasingly volatile.  If investors and mainstream analysts actually looked at the real numbers in demand (among other things), then the strange behavior in markets would be easy for them to understand. They will not look at such numbers until it is too late.</p>
<p>Instead, markets have chosen to chase headlines, and here is where the ugly circle of normalcy bias and cognitive dissonance completes itself. There are no positive indicators within the fundamentals today to energize market faith or market investment. So, investors and algorithmic trading computers track news headlines instead. The MSM hacks now have the power (along with central banks and governments) to create massive stock rallies with one or two carefully placed news tags, such as “<a href="http://www.cnbc.com/2016/01/27/russia-wants-to-talk-to-opec-about-output-cuts-to-bolster-oil-price.html" target="_blank">Russia To Discuss Oil Production Cuts With OPEC</a>.”</p>
<p>Market speculators and trading computers jump on these headlines without verifying if they are true. In most cases, they end up being false or just hearsay from an “unnamed source.” And so, the markets then crash further down into the abyss, waiting for the next headline to bolster activity even for a day.</p>
<p>The sad truth is, if any of these headlines turned out to be legitimate, their effect would still be meaningless in the long run as the overwhelming weight of the fundamentals continues to topple poorly placed optimism. Now that the investment world no longer has the certainty of central bank intervention as a useful tool, they don’t know if bad news is good news or if good news is bad news. The fact that the system is moving into a death spiral without the psychological crutch of central bank stimulus measures should tell you all you need to know about the supposed recovery since 2008.</p>
<p>No society wants to admit economic failure or economic sabotage, and this is why the con-game is able to continue in the face of so much concrete truth. Ultimately, the market trends and economic trends will flow into the negative. In the meantime, expect massive market rallies, rallies which will then disintegrate in a matter of days. And, whatever happens, never take what mainstream economists say very seriously. They have failed the public for long enough.</p>

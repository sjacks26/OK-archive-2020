<content:encoded>No, Ed,  we did not leave when ordered to do so.   Please tell me you are not one of those that believe what you read in the media?   We told the police to leave.   We told them they are on private property without a warrant and they need to leave.  Thus the 2.5 hour standoff.   The police eventually left.   We were there the next night and on the roof as well.   Need proof?   Check the ABC Nightline segment,  it was filmed on the roof, and I was armed,  all on Saturday night.   The real irony here is that you had to point out your own ignorance and naivete.

<content:encoded>We never left our post. The night we were initially conducted by the police, we were already in the process of breaking down for the night/day when they threatened to illegally arrest us. We went right back the very next evening, just as we had done every other night. We defied their illegal orders, and we won, just like Oath Keepers are meant to do.

<content:encoded>This supposed Richard Sharp is likely a Federal agent provacatuer.<br/>
Likely a Fed trying to fish/provoke. NO one here is interested in hate Richard is selling.
<p>I have had Jew, Atheist, Christian, Pagan, Humanist, Heathen, red, yellow, black, brown, white, Stand Watch at some time in my life as I slept like a baby.  Not often warm. Not always dry. But Even though I was surrounded by those trying to kill me.  I slept as well as a Fat Happy Baby.  Because I knew that one my brother’s was standing watch and would destroy anyone that tried to harm me. </p>
<p>Anyone that has been sent to war torn shit holes for mostly FALSE reasons has likely had same experience. I’m not all that special.</p>
<p>So No one here is buying BS, momma dropped you on head “Richard Sharp.”  AKA Pancake head..thin and flat, no room for brain cells.       </p>
<p>Protect the Constitution. Protect ALL Americans. Save the Republic.<br/>
Happy Hanukkah.<br/>
Merry Christmas.<br/>
Happy Holidays to ALL.<br/>
Love and Peace to ALL.</p>
<p>PS-If I owned one of the shops being guarded by Israel in Ferguson. I would sleep like a big fat baby.<br/>
Because I would know that a brother is standing watch as I sleep.</p>

<content:encoded>Sirs:
<p>I was considering joining until I read this; “Israel, an Army veteran and Oath Keeper, stands guard on Ferguson shop rooftop.” If this statement means that you have an Israeli in you ranks, you have been compromised. Those people start all Riots, Revolutions, and ALL wars, and then they crawl back into the shadows and let the blood flow. Then when the winner steps up, they step in and take over and kill all the leaders of which ever side winds as they don’t care which one it is. </p>
<p>I was at the Randy Weaver Siege in “92” with my Mini 14 and 30 round clip. We almost had a revolution then, but it was stopped by GOD. Interesting story.</p>
<p>You need to study those people that manipulate our lives and Gov. You are falling right into their plane to bark up the wrong tree. They’re in the other tree. Go after them and peace will be the true result.</p>
<p>–<strong><br/>
[Editor’s Note: Richard, we would prefer you do not join Oath Keepers. There are two reasons. The first is that you appear to be stupid. “Israel” is the gentleman’s given name. He is not an Israeli; he is an American Oath Keeper.  The second reason we would not want you as a member has to do with your generalization about Israel the nation. While we do understand that the Israeli lobby in WDC is powerful, and that MOSSAD works with our CIA, we do not want anyone for a member in Oath Keepers who is prone to lump all Israelis into one group and hold all Israelis responsible for the sins of a few in Israel’s government apparatus. In other words, your racist attitude and generalized animosity against all Israeli people is not welcome in Oath Keepers. Our by-laws are very clear about that.</strong></p>
<p>Salute!<br/>

<content:encoded>Police friend moved to Houston.<br/>
House robbed FOUR times.<br/>
Car stolen twice.<br/>
His wife pulled her gun on thugs trying to take her car while putting groceries in car.<br/>
This is crap that happened off duty. On duty was not a fun day at the office.
<p>He said things were not bad in Houston until Katrina refugees and Central American gangs moved in.<br/>
Anyone is allowed to cross our border and then set up shop being thugs.</p>
<p>So after combat in many the worlds hot spots as a Marine. Police street duty and Swat duties there after.<br/>
He decided Houston was no longer fit for a family man. </p>
<p>He moved.<br/>
An American city being vacated by a hard core combat vet, because of  the influx of criminals, due to an open border.<br/>
That is really sad.  That is the USSA changed Amerika.</p>
<p>Secure the Border.<br/>
Arrest arsonist, looters, thugs, criminals. Even the ones wearing suits and holding public office.</p>

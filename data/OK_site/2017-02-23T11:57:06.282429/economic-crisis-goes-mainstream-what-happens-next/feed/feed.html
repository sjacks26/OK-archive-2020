<content:encoded>Well…let’s see, here, and I may be off… but not far. The chaos and havoc promotion, which is the U.S. news media, overlooks (…by design?) major details which are relevant; so I would urge us all to not do the same. Thomas Jefferson knew an educated public was necessary to the establishment and continuance of a free people; and that education doesn’t stop when one graduates High School or College and any longer it certainly does not stop at the 6 or 11 PM news. I’m an Associate `round here; never got to serve due to a medical dis-qual (1H), but I can read, and have, considerably on this subject. 
<p>The issue is certainly not a simple “yes or no” situation, and involves considerable necessary change and impact on the current THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA (Inc.) system.</p>
<p>Iran has “…been close to having a nuclear weapon…” for over 30 years.  Syria, Libya, Ukraine, Iraq, Afghanistan…Well, check out Germany vs. Poland in 1939. Read “Hitler’s Henchmen” and “Night of The Long-Knives” to learn how those (who have for decades been embedded within our own military and intelligence, posing as Americans of “Life, Liberty…” while all the while manipulating conflicts into existence to empower themselves toward dictatorial powers).</p>
<p>The FED is the major culprit, or at least agency (definition being “… an agent or conduit through which change, plus or minus, alteration, increase, decrease can be effected”.), through which the American People have been slumbered into slavery. Supporting the FED is a dire conundrum, at best. By continuing their continued existence we support our own indebtedness and increased slavery. They must fail and be removed. Info here – <a href="http://alcuinbramerton.blogspot.jp/" rel="nofollow">http://alcuinbramerton.blogspot.jp/</a>. Also, read “I Was An Economic Hit-Man” by John Perkins, “The Secret of Jeckyl Island” (not sure that last title is accurate).</p>
<p>Are there bad, evil, insane individuals who exhibit their fundamentalist views with murder and mayhem? Terror is terror; but it was always been the province of Police work, not continual war-fare against and undeclared enemy or  “Pre-emptive” actions taken unilaterally by government elements who supposedly represent all of us; it disgusts me that such underhanded (but very smoothly) use of the good will of brave and giving vet’s, and their families, and others in gov’t and general law enforcement to destroy our United States results in a diminished United States and bigger THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.</p>

<content:encoded>Just a comment on the Iranian deal, the worst part of it is the inspections. The way it’s now they habe 24 between the notice and the actual inspection. It should have been NO NOTICE INSPECTIONS.

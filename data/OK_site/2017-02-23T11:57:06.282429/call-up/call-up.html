Fellow Oath Keepers and Patriots,</h3>
<p>We are working with Pacific Patriots Network (PPN)(See <a href="http://www.pacificpatriotsnetwork.com/" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.pacificpatriotsnetwork.com/', 'http://www.pacificpatriotsnetwork.com/');">http://www.pacificpatriotsnetwork.com/</a>) which has established a buffer between the Wildlife Refuge occupiers and the authorities in Oregon.  PPN has asked Oath Keepers to put out the call for volunteers to assist in this peaceful mission, which includes a “hearts-and-minds”campaign with the locals, as well as facilitating open dialogue and negotiations between law enforcement and Ammon Bundy.</p>
<p>If you volunteer, you must go to the <a href="http://www.pacificpatriotsnetwork.com/" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.pacificpatriotsnetwork.com/', 'above PPN website ');">above PPN website </a>and go to the “<a href="http://www.pacificpatriotsnetwork.com/contact.php" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.pacificpatriotsnetwork.com/contact.php', 'Contact');">Contact</a>” page and then email the volunteer coordinator (<a href="mailto:volunteer@pacificpatriotsnetwork.com">volunteer@pacificpatriotsnetwork.com</a>) and initiate their vetting process.  You must go through that process. This is not an option, and if you fail to do so, you will be turned away.  We are diligently working to coordinate all volunteers.  We always look for admin and outreach volunteers regardless of physical condition, along with security personnel, to provide a level number of  volunteers at all times.</p>
<p>PPN wants all volunteers that come to dress in civies, no BDUs, or other camouflage clothing.   if security/tactical bring you kit. PPN is requiring long guns stored out of sight, and pistol open carry if no OR CCW.  We have some hotel rooms and food to help defray your costs.  The weather is cold to colder (30* to 35*f days, nights to very low 3* to 7*f). Be prepared for wind chill factors below zero.  Bring medical supplies for yourself and others, in case of need.  At the least, bring your Individual First Aid Kit (IFAK), but if you can bring more, please do.</p>
<p>Oath Keeper volunteers will come under operational control of PPN with Oath Keeper National Operations NCO, SGM Santoro helping to facilitate integration into the PPN operation.  We are united with the PPN to bring this situation to a safe and peaceful resolution.</p>
<p>Only level headed patriots, who are calm under pressure, need apply as this is a tense situation and we don’t want a negligent discharge or other mishap.  Hot heads stay home.</p>
<p>If you cannot go but would still like to support this effort please use the PayPal Button below (which is the same as on the PPN website).  All funds donated go directly to the PPN.</p>
<p>Please Honor your sacred oath as you pledged.</p>
<p>Joseph Santoro, SGM, US Army RET</p>
<p>Oath Keepers National BOD Member, and OK National Operations NCO</p>

<p>NOTE FROM STEWART:  We are honor bound to do all we can to prevent this from turning into another “Waco” type incident.  We still don’t agree with what Ammond has done, as stated at length elsewhere, but we must try to prevent the Obama Administration dropping the hammer on him and his followers.   Oath Keepers have been on the ground there since the beginning of this incident.   Two of the Founders of PPN are Oath Keepers (Joseph Rice and Brandon Rapolla) and SGM Santoro has been there for over a week, lending his wisdom and experience.   We are already there, so any objections to our participation are now moot.  This is the right thing to do.  We have brothers and sisters on the ground who need our help, and we should help them in a righteous and honorable cause to try to keep the peace and keep this from blowing up in all our faces.   This is a very limited and narrow mission.  You are not going there to be part of Ammon Bundy’s security or to take part in his occupation.   You are just a buffer, and in particular, there to facilitate understanding and open communication, as well as to bring awareness of the broader issue of justice for the Hammonds and justice for Western land users.  If you are able, and within driving range, and you have your own family provided for, then please volunteer at the PPN site.  But be aware that this is a fluid and fast changing situation.</p>
<p>Please note that there will be future demonstrations and we will keep you updated here at OathKeepers.org</p>
<p>UPDATE 1/22/2016:   I updated the text to add “If you volunteer, you must go to the <a href="http://www.pacificpatriotsnetwork.com/" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.pacificpatriotsnetwork.com/', 'above PPN website ');">above PPN website </a>and go to the “<a href="http://www.pacificpatriotsnetwork.com/contact.php" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.pacificpatriotsnetwork.com/contact.php', 'Contact');">Contact</a>” page and then email the volunteer coordinator (<a href="mailto:volunteer@pacificpatriotsnetwork.com">volunteer@pacificpatriotsnetwork.com</a>) and initiate their vetting process.”   There was some confusion on where to go on the PPN site to volunteer.  I hope that clears it up.</p>
<p>MEDICAL PERSONNEL URGENTLY NEEDED.   There is a vital need for trained medical personnel to volunteer.   There is little or no medical outside of the Burns, OR hospital, and we need you to step up if you are medically trained, especially for field trama (medic, corpsman, civilian EMT or Paramedic, trauma nurse, doctor, etc).  If you think you can help, hit the contact tab on the PPM site and be sure to put “MEDICAL VOLUNTEER” in the subject box.</p>
<p>Also need Communications personnel.  Just as prior operations, medical and communications are the two skillsets most in need and least on site.  Please help fix that if you have the skills and can make it there.</p>

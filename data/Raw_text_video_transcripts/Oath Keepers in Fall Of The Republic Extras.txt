Title Screen: OK Tab, with “Est. APRIL 19, 2009, LEXINGTON GREEN.” Oathkeepers.org

DG: When you entrust a man with the public trust, and you know he’s human, and you don’t want him to run amuck, you bind him down with an oath. We heard today about someday you may see those in the uniform in violation of their oaths, putting the gun at you their masters in an unlawful manner. I pray that never happens. It has happened. I want to assure you, the man in the uniform will not be I.

CD: Law enforcement and military are not the enemy. A lot of people think we’re gonna have to fight the US forces, we’re gonna have to fight the Marines, fight the Army. That’s not the case. US military is not against the people, we are the people.

GL: Today, in many respects, our government is stepping aside the rule of law.

NR: Gun confiscation is exactly what happened during the state of emergency following Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans (0:01:07.0).

AJ: Social controllers are very scared of police and military rediscovering their oath of office.

SR: [Administering an oath to GC] Not obey orders to impose martial law.

GC: I will not obey.

AJ: They understand that throughout history, tyranny comes to your door in a uniform.

SR: I will not obey orders to conduct warrantless searches on American people

GC: I will not obey.

DG: Every instance you can think of in history, where republics have fallen through usurpation of power. Particularly think of the times when it has happened through the military. 

GAC: My father lived under Stalin. His whole family was killed by Stalin. My mother’s family escaped from North Korea, lost all of their property and were supposed to be killed 3 or 4 times. (0:01:53.6) I was fortunate to be born in this great nation. Yet I see the same signs, our country going in the direction my parents escaped from.

NR: US troops also arrived, far easier to do now after last year’s elimination of the 1878 Posse Comitatus Act. That forbid American troops from policing on US soil.

SR: I will not obey any orders to force American citizens into any form of detention camps under any pretext.

GC: I will not obey. (0:02:27.1)

DG: To what degree are we anymore mindful of oaths?

RM: If we had law enforcement in America keeping their oath, to do just that, we would have our constitutional republic back tomorrow. That’s how powerful this movement is.

GL: I’m GL, the Patriot Pastor. This is where the battle was fought, right on the Lexington Battle Green. This is sacred ground, one of the most important pieces of real estate in America. This is where it happened. This is the shot heard around the world, and still being heard I think. I grew up in Lexington, standing on the Green, playing on it. When I was a boy, my mother told me about our ancestry. I started to go on the village green. I didn’t pay a whole lot of attention except to the statute of John Parker. Everyone could look up to him, he wasn’t white he wasn’t brown he wasn’t red he wasn’t yellow he wasn’t black, he’s green actually. So anyone can identify with him. I said one day when I grow up I want to be like him.

GL: Welcome to Lexington, the cradle of American liberty (0:03:49.5)

GL: Most people don’t know what happened at the Battle of Lexington. Basically, the night before the battle, April 18, riders came in, that’s the midnight ride of Paul Revere, it was actually John Dawes and Prescott, because Paul Revere was interdicted by British troops. They were bringing a message from Dr. Warren and the Committees of Correspondence and the Committees of Safety in Boston to tell them it looks like the British are mounted troops. We’re not exactly sure what they’re trying to do, they’ll probably go after the munitions in Concord. They’re probably going to try to capture Samuel Adams and John Hancock and either send them back to England in chains or shoot them right there (0:04:36.8). When the British came, it was obvious they had some bad plan. The Minutemen, the regulated militia, did not want to engage the British troops in a fight. These men stood their ground when they were told, you are to drop your weapons and disband. They started to disband, but they would not drop their weapons because they were militia. When they started to disband, they were fired upon. The first shot was fired by the British, not by the Minutemen, by the colonists, by the people of Lexington. (0:05:14.7) We can find that in Jonas Clark’s narrative. 8 were shot and killed, many were bayoneted, some died later. Many were wounded. They stopped the British as they were on their march to Concord. They did what was right. This was a principled stand for freedom and we’re doing the same thing today.

SR: We will not obey orders to disarm the American people

GC: I will not obey.

SR: Today we’re here on the Green of Lexington, April 19, which is the anniversary of April 19, 1775, which was the first shot fired in the American Revolution. I’m SR, founder of OK, which is a non-partisan association of current serving military, police, and veterans. All of us who swore an oath to defend the Constitution. Our mission is to make sure all the other oath takers are oath keepers.

NR: (0:06:08.6) Gun confiscation is exactly what happened during the state of emergency following Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans. US troops also arrived, something far easier to do now thanks to last year’s elimination of the 1878 Posse Comitatus Act, which forbid US troops from policing on US soil.

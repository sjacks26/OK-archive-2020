<p><strong>Brothers &amp; Sisters in Arms,</strong></p>
<p><strong>My name is  SGM Joseph A. Santoro (Ret) and I served 25 yrs US Army Inf. and EOD, 5yrs Contractor at the 10th SF Group and 3 yrs Contractor at the US Army EOD School.  I have served this great country for 33 yrs. After retiring I volunteered with the Pueblo County Republican Party as the Precinct Coordinator for the 2012 election. I finally realized that a different tact was needed to free our country from tyranny.  I spent many hours, as I believe that many of you have, or are doing, trying to decide what actions to take.  I finally decided to join the Oath Keepers and the 3%ers patriot organizations.  I currently serve on the National Board for the Oath Keepers and with the 3%ers of Colorado and have never looked back.</strong></p>
<p><strong>I want to say to each and every one of you out there that the time for being keyboard warriors is over and we must stand up and step out.  Patriots can no longer sit back and observe without taking action.  Those actions must take into account, and be based on our Constitution, Bill of rights and the “Rule of Law”.  At no time can we surrender the Moral high ground. Every one of us swore an oath to protect the Constitution of the United States from all enemies, foreign and domestic.  We pledged our lives, our fortunes and our Sacred Honor.  To this end I am asking each of your to stand up, step out, and honor your sacred honor pledge.</strong></p>
<p><strong>I am extremely proud of what we are doing to take back American from the individuals who would destroy America.  We must be careful when going to situations like the Bundy Ranch, Sugar Pine mine, White Hope mine, Fergueson, MO, and now the Burns, OR situation.  We are providing a buffer and security for the Bundy occupiers at the Wildlife Refuge to prevent another Waco.  As veterans we are the ones that know how sweet the taste of freedom really is as many of us have bled and some have died to insure our freedoms.  The only way for us to insure freedom in our country is to get away from our computers, stand up and volunteer to support our fellow Americans.  When any citizen’s Constitutional rights are being infringed upon we must insure they have a redress of their grievances in defense of their rights.</strong><br/>
<strong> I do understand that many of us are no longer in the physical shape to return to the field, however, all of us have skill sets that are valuable.  We can provide the leadership needed for any emergency.  Many people are waking up to the reality that they are not prepared to survive during any type of emergency.  We can help them learn about communications, medical, security, preparedness and engineering.  These are skills that will be needed during natural or man made disasters and are sorely needed in today’s world.  If all of us pass these skills to our fellow Americans, we empower them, make them more self sufficient, and secure freedom for all.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Having said all this I am asking each one of you to honor the oath that you took years ago.  Since I believe in God I have asked for his grace to make me the instrument of his will and that I do the right things to bring his kingdom back to earth.  I will stand with everyone of you if the SHTF and I ask for God’s blessings for each one of you.  Please search your hearts and minds and make the decision to support our country. Please close ranks with us, your fellow Patriots, so we re-secure the freedoms given to us by God Almighty and our Founding Fathers.</strong></p>
<p><strong>SGM Joseph A. Santoro</strong><br/>
<strong> Oath Keeper and 3%er for Life</strong></p>
<p>NOTE:  SGM Santoro is also the Oath Keepers National Operations NCO, and is in Burns, OR, in that capacity, to assist with the Pacific Patriot Network (PPN) “Buffer” operation to prevent another “Waco” and to facilitate open dialogue between the Feds and Ammon Bundy, toward a peaceful resolution.  While none of the groups in the PPN coalition agree with Bundy’s chosen method, we agree with his cause of justice for the Hammonds, the vital necessity to return western lands unjustly claimed by the federal government to the states and the people, and the protection of the rights of people of the land out west.  And we agree Ammon Bundy and his follower have the right to life and due process.   So, we are obligated to step in between and keep the peace.   Here is SGM Santoro at a press conference at the Wildlife Refuge, explaining this:</p>
<p><iframe allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Z11RFT4BIPo" width="560"></iframe></p>
<blockquote>
<div>
<p>“<strong><em>Our greatest concern is that the federal government ‘Wacos’ the people right down that hill.  It is our opinion, that, as men and women, as free Americans – patriots – that if they do that, they will start a conflagration so great – nobody wants it, nobody needs it, but I think it will grow out of hand exactly like the American Revolution.  …. after hundreds of hours of research, and many conference calls, we will be coming here to Burns to come under the umbrella of the Pacific Patriot Network to help them in any way that we can, to advise the people of Burns, Oregon, particularly the committee for Safety, an anyone else that asks for information.   We will also, if the people of this area would like to be trained we will be more than happy to train them in the manual of arms</em></strong>.</p>
</div>
<p><em><strong>I say it again, one more time, no more free wacos.  The American patriots in this country have had enough.  We’re standing up.  We’re going to everything to bring this to a swift conclusion, peacefully.  So that it is amicable for everyone.  But we are supporting the redress of grievances here and all over the United States. </strong></em>(SGM Joseph A. Santoro (Ret.) Oath Keepers BOD member, and National Operations NCO, at January 12, 2016, press conference, OR).<em><strong><br/>

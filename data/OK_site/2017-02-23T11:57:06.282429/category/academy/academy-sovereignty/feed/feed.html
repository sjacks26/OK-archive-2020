<p><strong>This little diddy</strong> is one which you’ll want to save and share with friends, especially with our friends of the “statist” mindset. It has been on the Internet since 1993. The <a href="http://www.waterwind.com/gratslav.html" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #0000ff;"><em><strong>original page</strong></em></span></a> is still available.

<h1 style="text-align: center;">Grateful Slave</h1>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">by Paine’s Torch</h3>
<p style="text-align: center;">copyright 1993 – ZENO Press</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>I am a grateful slave.</strong><br/>
My master is a good man.<br/>
He gives me food, shelter, work and other things.<br/>
All he requires in return is that I obey him.<br/>
I am told he has the power to control my life.<br/>
I look up to him,<br/>
and wish that I were so powerful.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>My master must understand the world better than I,<br/>
because he was chosen by many others<br/>
for his respected position.<br/>
I sometimes complain,<br/>
but fear I cannot live without his help.<br/>
He is a good man.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>My master protects my money from theft,<br/>
before and after he takes half of it.<br/>
Before taking his half,<br/>
he says only he can protect my money.<br/>
After taking it, he says it is still mine.<br/>
When he spends my money,<br/>
he says I own the things he has bought.<br/>
I don’t understand this, but I believe him.<br/>
He is a good man.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I need my master for protection,<br/>
because others would hurt me.<br/>
Or they would take my money<br/>
and use it for themselves.<br/>
My master is better than them:<br/>
When he takes my money, I still own it.<br/>
The things he buys are mine.<br/>
I cannot sell them,<br/>
or decide how they are used,<br/>
but they are mine.<br/>
My master tells me so,<br/>
and I believe him.<br/>
He is a good man.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><a href="https://www.oathkeepers.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/suburbia_wiredDotCom.jpg"><img alt="suburbia_wiredDotCom" class="wp-image-10126 alignleft" height="463" src="https://www.oathkeepers.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/suburbia_wiredDotCom.jpg" width="579"/></a>My master provides free education for my children.<br/>
He teaches them to respect and obey him<br/>
and all future masters they will have.<br/>
He says they are being taught well;<br/>
learning things they will need to know in the future.<br/>
I believe him.<br/>
He is a good man.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>My master cares about other masters,<br/>
who don’t have good slaves.<br/>
He makes me contribute to their support.<br/>
I don’t understand why slaves must work<br/>
for more than one master,<br/>
but my master says it is necessary.<br/>
I believe him.<br/>
He is a good man.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Other slaves ask my master for some of my money.<br/>
Since he is good to them as he is to me, he agrees.<br/>
This means he must take more of my money;<br/>
but he says this is good for me.<br/>
I ask my master why it would not be better<br/>
to let each of us keep our own money.<br/>
He says it is because he knows<br/>
what is best for each of us.<br/>
We believe him.<br/>
He is a good man.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>My master tells me:<br/>
Evil masters in other places are not as good as he;<br/>
they threaten our comfortable lifestyle and peace.<br/>
So, he sends my children<br/>
to fight the slaves of evil masters.<br/>
I mourn their deaths,<br/>
but my master says it is necessary.<br/>
He gives me medals for their sacrifice,<br/>
and I believe him.<br/>
He is a good man.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Good masters sometimes have to kill evil masters,<br/>
and their slaves.<br/>
This is necessary to preserve our way of life;<br/>
to show others that our version of slavery is best.<br/>
I asked my master:<br/>
“Why do the evil masters’ slaves have to be killed;<br/>
along with their evil master?”<br/>
He said: “Because they carry out his evil deeds.”<br/>
“Besides, they could never learn our system;<br/>
they have been indoctrinated to believe<br/>
that only their master is good.”<br/>
My master knows what is best.<br/>
He protects me and my children.<br/>
He is a good man.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><a href="https://www.oathkeepers.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/suburb_CHESS2014_Suburbs_Photo_MStrozier_Flickrr.jpg"><img alt="suburb_CHESS2014_Suburbs_Photo_MStrozier_Flickrr" class="wp-image-10130 alignleft" height="264" src="https://www.oathkeepers.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/suburb_CHESS2014_Suburbs_Photo_MStrozier_Flickrr.jpg" width="397"/></a>My master lets me vote for a new master,<br/>
every few years.<br/>
I cannot vote to have no master,<br/>
but he generously lets me choose<br/>
between two candidates he has selected.<br/>
I eagerly wait until election day,<br/>
since voting allows me to forget that I am a slave.<br/>
Until then, my current master tells me what to do.<br/>
I accept this.<br/>
It has always been so,<br/>
and I would not change tradition.<br/>
My master is a good man.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>At the last election,<br/>
about half the slaves were allowed to vote.<br/>
The other half either broke rules set by the master,<br/>
or were not thought by him to be fit.<br/>
Those who break the rules<br/>
should know better than to disobey!<br/>
Those not considered fit should gratefully accept<br/>
the master chosen for them by others.<br/>
It is right, because we have always done it this way.<br/>
My master is a good man.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><a href="https://www.oathkeepers.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/SPOiLER.jpg"><img alt="SPOiLER" class="size-full wp-image-10131 alignleft" height="350" src="https://www.oathkeepers.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/SPOiLER.jpg" width="250"/></a>There were two candidates.<br/>
One received a majority of the vote –<br/>
about one-fourth of the slave population.<br/>
I asked why the new master<br/>
can rule over all the slaves,<br/>
if he only received votes from one-fourth of them?<br/>
My master said:<br/>
“Because some wise masters long ago<br/>
did it that way.”<br/>
“Besides, you are the slaves;<br/>
and we are the masters.”<br/>
I did not understand his answer, but I believed him.<br/>
My master knows what is best for me.<br/>
He is a good man.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Some slaves have evil masters.<br/>
They take more than half of their slaves’ money<br/>
and are chosen by only one-tenth,<br/>
rather than one-fourth, of their slaves.<br/>
My master says they are different from him.<br/>
I believe him.<br/>
He is a good man.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I asked if I could ever become a master,<br/>
instead of a slave.<br/>
My master said, “Yes, anything is possible.”<br/>
“But first you must pledge allegiance<br/>
to your present master,<br/>
and promise not to abandon the system<br/>
that made you a slave.”<br/>
I am encouraged by this possibility.<br/>
My master is a good man.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He tells me slaves are the real masters,<br/>
because they can vote for their masters.<br/>
I do not understand this, but I believe him.<br/>
He is a good man;<br/>
who lives for no other purpose<br/>
than to make his slaves happy.<br/>
I asked if I could be neither a master nor a slave.<br/>
My master said, “No, you must be one or the other.”<br/>
“There are no other choices.”<br/>
I believe him.<br/>
He knows best.<br/>
He is a good man.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I asked my master how our system is different,<br/>
from those with evil masters.<br/>
He said:<br/>
“In our system, masters work for the slaves.”<br/>
No longer confused, I am beginning to accept his logic.<br/>
Now I see it!<br/>
Slaves are in control of their masters,<br/>
because they can choose new masters every few years.<br/>
When the masters appear to control the slaves<br/>
in between elections,<br/>
it is all a grand delusion!<br/>
In reality, they are carrying out the slaves’ desires.<br/>
For if this were not so,<br/>
they would not have been chosen in the last election.<br/>
How clear it is to me now!<br/>
I shall never doubt the system again.<br/>
My master is a good man.</p>

]]&gt;</description>
<content:encoded>–
<p><a href="https://www.oathkeepers.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/waco-never-forget.jpg"><img alt="waco never forget" class=" wp-image-9594 alignleft" height="234" src="https://www.oathkeepers.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/waco-never-forget.jpg" width="379"/></a><strong>While the Bureau of Land Management (BLM)</strong> is taking it on the chin in the western States the current occupation of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge in Oregon has prompted Oath Keepers Founder and President Stewart Rhodes to issue a cautionary <a href="https://www.oathkeepers.org/critical-warning-to-u-s-military-and-federal-leo-do-not-follow-orders-to-waco-ammon-bundy-occupation-in-oregon-or-you-risk-starting-a-civil-war/" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #0000ff;"><em><strong>warning</strong></em></span></a> which is going viral across America:</p>
<h2 class="fn entry-title">“Warning to U.S. Military and Federal LEOs: Do Not Follow Orders to “Waco” Ammon Bundy Occupation, or Risk Civil War”</h2>
<p>Of particular interest to me is Stewart’s use of the name “Waco”.</p>
<p>On April 19 in 2016 the nation will reflect once again on Waco. The date will mark the twenty-third anniversary of one of the most cruel, insane, and even demonic actions ever perpetrated by the U.S. government upon its own citizens. It is not the only cruel and insane event done by government to the governed, but it is one of the most horrendous.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.oathkeepers.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/waco-texas_ammoland.jpg"><img alt="waco-texas_ammoland" class=" wp-image-9592 alignleft" height="359" src="https://www.oathkeepers.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/waco-texas_ammoland.jpg" width="462"/></a>As an older man I recall seeing the burning of that church in Texas while at a restaurant in Georgia. The entire restaurant was glued to the TV screen in disbelief. All we had heard was that the church had been molesting little children and manufacturing illegal drugs. That, a sickened nation would later learn, was a pack of lies made up by the ATF and presented to the Pentagon in hopes of getting military aid in resolving the standoff which resulted from the botched raid on the church.</p>
<p>The church had been assaulted by the ATF in a very stupid raid to garner support for the ATF’s increased budget requests due before Congress, a fact we learned in retrospect from the Dallas Morning News. As it turns out, the ATF had notified the press that there would be a newsworthy event at Waco and the ATF actually requested media coverage. <em>Why?</em></p>
<p>The ATF felt they needed something big in “the news” to push through their requested budget increases. So goes the logic of government agencies, because government agencies, as our nation’s Founders well knew, by their very nature become ruthless infrastructural mechanisms of self-perpetuation. <a href="https://www.oathkeepers.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/waco2.jpg"><img alt="waco2" class=" wp-image-9593 alignright" height="246" src="https://www.oathkeepers.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/waco2.jpg" width="327"/></a></p>
<p>So Waco has become an undying testament to the inherent abusive nature of government. The recognition of that nature, by our Founders, has much to do with why there is a Bill of Rights attached to the Constitution. But the ATF could not care less about the original intent of the Founders. Nope! The ATF marches to the beat of its own drums, fully-well knowing that according to the Constitution the agency does not even have any legitimate authority to exist, much less the authority to murder scores of women and children in horrible fiery deaths over some alleged “gun violations”. My God! The document says “.<em>..shall not be infringed.</em>”  All the ATF does is infringe, and it cares not one whit about your or my unalienable rights or our Constitutional protections as American citizens. Nope. The ATF is hell-bent on tormenting anyone who would dare stand up for the fuller meaning of our Constitution and Bill of Rights.</p>
<p>But while most readers here already know such truths, I would like to invite everyone to carefully view a movie which has been around for more than fifteen years. Those who have seen this film will learn yet more by watching it again, as I do each time I review it. Those who have not seen this owe it to themselves to inform themselves with the ghastly truth of the outright evil and domestic terror perpetrated by the ATF on a church full of good American citizens. The movie reveals the government’s feeble and vain attempts to cover-up the ATF’s sins in Congressional hearings.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.oathkeepers.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Charles-Schumer.jpg"><img alt="Charles Schumer" class=" wp-image-9597 alignright" height="199" src="https://www.oathkeepers.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Charles-Schumer.jpg" width="265"/></a></p>
<p><em><strong>Pay close attention to Charles Schumer’s wicked facial expressions.</strong></em></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>After watching this film, allow oneself to reflect upon what is behind Mike Vanderboegh’s famous statement, “No more free Wacos”. Then one will more fully understand why Stewart Rhodes alluded to Waco in his open letter to the military and enforcement agents who are being pulled into a possible confrontation with American citizens at Burns, Oregon.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>“It’s more important to have a gun in your hand than a cop on the phone.”</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>Editor’s Note:</strong> Regarding the guns owned by, and the inherent gun rights belonging to all Americans, Fox News has just <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/us/2016/01/15/growing-number-police-chiefs-sheriffs-join-call-to-arms.html" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #0000ff;"><em><strong>published</strong></em></span></a> a remarkable stride toward common sense perception of reality. I will just place a few key paragraphs below from the Fox News article and urge every Oath Keeper and patriot to enjoy this article at the Fox News website.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #0000ff;"><em><strong><a href="http://www.foxnews.com/us/2016/01/15/growing-number-police-chiefs-sheriffs-join-call-to-arms.html" target="_blank">http://www.foxnews.com/us/2016/01/15/growing-number-police-chiefs-sheriffs-join-call-to-arms.html</a></strong></em></span></p>
<p>But I also would like to note for our readers that a question does exist regarding State-level codes and statutes which might somehow force free Americans to jump through government hoops and obtain “permits” to exercise protected rights, one of which is the Second Amendment.</p>
<p>Attached to that question is the observation that the Amendment itself states “<em>…shall not be infringed.</em>” Clearly, having to buy a government “permit” to carry one’s arms inside the U. S. of America is an infringement. Yet I do realize that most folks settle for the collectivist’s view on that, and most folks seem to feel that after all there should be *<em>some</em>* restrictions on gun ownership and gun bearing.</p>
<p>Therefore I am not directly challenging the consensus sentiment on the matter — but certainly wish to acknowledge the more aware Oath Keepers who have read <a href="https://www.oathkeepers.org/oath-keepers-academy/edwin-vieira/" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #0000ff;"><em><strong>Dr. Edwin Vieira’s books</strong></em></span></a> and subsequently do understand the fullest meaning carried in the words, “<em>…shall not be infringed.</em>”</p>
<p>That said, let’s jump into, and enjoy, a rare <em>friendly flag</em> article from the mainstream media:</p>
<h1>Growing number of police chiefs, sheriffs join call to arms</h1>
<p><em>This article was posted at Fox News by Cody Derespina on January 15 2016.</em></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #0000ff;"><em><strong><a href="http://www.foxnews.com/us/2016/01/15/growing-number-police-chiefs-sheriffs-join-call-to-arms.html" target="_blank">http://www.foxnews.com/us/2016/01/15/growing-number-police-chiefs-sheriffs-join-call-to-arms.html</a></strong></em></span></p>
<p><strong>Miscellaneous  paragraphs from the Fox News article:</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">One of a growing number of rural and big-city law enforcement officials who openly encourages responsible gun ownership, [Florida Sheriff Grady] Judd believes guns allow citizens to defend themselves when police cannot.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">“If you are foolish enough to break into someone’s home, you can expect to be shot in Polk County,” Judd said in a statement after a homeowner shot a would-be home invader earlier this month. “It’s more important to have a gun in your hand than a cop on the phone.”</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Such full-throated embrace of the Second Amendment as a crime-fighting tool isn’t confined to red states like Florida…</p>
<p><a href="https://www.oathkeepers.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Marion-County-Sheriff-Chris-Blair.jpg"><img alt="Marion County Sheriff Chris Blair" class="wp-image-9573 alignleft" height="326" src="https://www.oathkeepers.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Marion-County-Sheriff-Chris-Blair.jpg" width="514"/></a><strong>Marion County Sheriff Chris Blair</strong>, <em>(pictured at left)</em> who has said, “If you are certified to carry a gun, I would like to encourage you to do so.” <span class="source">(Marion County Sheriff’s Office)</span></p>
<p>….One California police chief is backing teachers in his district packing heat. Detroit Police Chief James Craig has been a leader in urging his community to arm itself. A Maryland sheriff is working with the state’s general assembly to try to make it easier for citizens to obtain handgun permits.</p>
<p>(<em><strong>End teaser paragraphs from the Fox News article.</strong></em>)</p>
<p>The gun culture has been saying it for decades, and I am delighted that Florida Sheriff Grady Judd got it out on Fox News —</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><strong>“It’s more important to have a gun in your hand than a cop on the phone.”</strong></em></p>
<p>That is “common sense”, as all Oath Keepers know. It is encouraging to see that sort of common sense gaining momentum in the public attitude and perception. Now that the Empire’s so-called “War on Terror” has been created afar and brought home to American soil, (courtesy of our own Intelligence community and coercive foreign policy), people everywhere are feeling the need for personal protection. Chattanooga and San Bernardino are two prime examples. Just as Obama has proven himself to be the greatest gun salesman of all time, so too has the collectivist anti-gun lobby suddenly seen a severe blow-back as many on the Left side of the aisle are awakening to the logic in the gun culture’s “common sense”.  To justify that statement I’ll add here one more paragraph from the Fox News article.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><em>“The number of concealed handgun permits soared from 4.6 million in 2007 to 12.8 million in 2015, according to the Crime Prevention Research Center. Those numbers match an evolution in the general public’s attitude toward guns. Just 35 percent of respondents in an August 2000 Gallup poll said they felt safer with a gun in the house. That rose to 42 percent in 2004, 47 percent in 2006 and 63 percent in 2014.”</em></p>
<p>Obama, anti-gun lobby — I’ve got just four words (and a smile) for you:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>“Sorry ’bout your luck.”</em></strong></p>

<h1 class="post-title title title-large entry-title" style="text-align: center;">BREAKING:</h1>
<h2 class="post-title title title-large entry-title" style="text-align: center;">Idaho Legislators Travel To Burns Oregon</h2>
<p><strong>This article</strong> was posted at <a href="http://www.radiofreeredoubt.com/2016/01/12/breaking-idaho-legislators-travel-to-burns-oregon/" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #0000ff;"><strong>Radio Free Redoubt</strong></span></a> by Polly-01 on January 12 2016.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Idaho State Representatives</strong> Judy Boyle, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/RepHeatherScott/?fref=nf" target="_blank"><strong>Heather Scott</strong></a>, and Sage Dixon were among a group of western state legislators who traveled to Burns, Oregon last Saturday (January 8, 2016) on a fact finding mission.</p>
<p>We were among a selected group of state legislators invited by an Oregon legislator because of our commitment to liberty, freedom and efforts to curb federal government overreach. Numerous<span class="text_exposed_show"> constituents in each of our Districts have expressed concerns about the situation unfolding in Burns, and similar frustrations in dealing with federal agencies. We would like to avoid any type of similar situations in our own districts; therefore we went to assess this situation for ourselves and our constituents.</span></p>
<p>We first met in Burns with local county officials, law enforcement officers, and the FBI to receive a briefing and make them fully aware of our intentions. We were cautioned about proceeding out to the Refuge for various reasons but were not prohibited from going. One county official was visibly hostile towards our presence and used very inflammatory language about our participation, and the citizens at the refuge.</p>
<p>Based on information we heard during this meeting, coupled with other discussions with local residents, we determined the need to corroborate this information with that offered by the group at the Refuge to completely understand the situation. We made the decision as a group to hear both sides of the story which required hearing directly from Ammond Bundy and his group. Clearly, based on our brief visit to Burns, a further investigation is warranted to find a satisfactory solution not only to the standoff but to the alleged unwarranted actions of the federal agencies.</p>
<p>At the Refuge, we received a petition of grievances from the group, which is a right guaranteed to citizens under the First Amendment. They believed their grievances have been and still are being ignored.</p>
<p>It is part of our job as legislators to continually understand citizen grievances, find solutions based on facts and attempt to de-escalate volatile situations whenever possible. We believe it is very important to try to preempt any similar situation that may occur in our state.<br/>
We expect to stay abreast of the situation and will provide any further information we discover</p>

<p><strong> Written by Patrick Wood and published at</strong>  <a href="http://technocracy.news/index.php/2015/10/23/reflexive-law-the-new-legal-system-driving-sustainable-development/" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><strong>Technocracy dot News</strong></em></span></a></p>
<p>–</p>
<p>Every society in history has been hinged on compatible systems of social structure, economics and politics. And, every unique society is regulated by a compatible legal system that settles all disputes between its citizens. In the Western world and especially in America, this is revered as the “Rule of Law”.</p>
<p>On August 26, 2014 the <em>New York Times</em> blasted out the head­line, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/27/us/politics/obama-pursuing-climate-accord-in-lieu-of-treaty.html?_r=0"><em>Obama Pur­suing Cli­mate Accord in Lieu of Treaty</em></a>. In short, Obama was to use Exec­u­tive Orders to entangle the U.S. in a global “treaty” on cli­mate change, without con­sulting the U.S. Senate. How­ever, the Con­sti­tu­tion requires the Senate to vote on all treaties and the bar is high: It takes a two-third vote to approve.</p>
<p>To the globalist, the Con­sti­tu­tion is out. The Rule of law has col­lapsed. Reflexive Law has sur­passed it all. The bal­ance of this article will show you how and why.</p>
<p>If you are saying “Huh?”, you had better read every word of this report and figure it out, because this might be the most impor­tant shard of evi­dence ever revealed about the wrenching trans­for­ma­tion of Amer­ican society.</p>
<p>Obama’s prin­cipal adviser and “nego­tiator” on this so-called cli­mate accord was John Podesta, and this whole treaty-by-executive-order debacle can be laid squarely at his feet. Until just recently, Podesta was a member of the Tri­lat­eral Com­mis­sion. He was Bill Clinton’s chief-of-staff in the 1990s and the orig­inal insti­gator of Exec­u­tive Branch policy of using Exec­u­tive Orders to bypass Con­gress on cer­tain issues. Clinton, also a Tri­lat­eral member, cre­ated many such EO’s to side-step Con­gress, and Con­gress unfor­tu­nately let him get away with it.</p>
<p>Enough about Podesda. Just remember that he was the prime mover in what I am about to reveal.</p>
<p>The NYT article stated,</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>To side­step that require­ment </em>[of a 2/3 Senate vote]<em>, Pres­i­dent Obama’s cli­mate nego­tia­tors are devising what they call a “polit­i­cally binding” deal that would “name and shame” coun­tries into cut­ting their emis­sions. The deal is likely to face strong objec­tions from Repub­li­cans on Capitol Hill and from poor coun­tries around the world, but nego­tia­tors say it may be the only real­istic path.</em></p>

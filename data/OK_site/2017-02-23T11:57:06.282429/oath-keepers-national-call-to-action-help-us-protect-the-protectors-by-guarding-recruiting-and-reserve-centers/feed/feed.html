<content:encoded>Okay, you called us out about 11 weeks ago, and Indiana Region #1 has been, and still is, standing guard at the Fort Wayne Armed Forces Career Center, but we’ve heard nothing more about it. We feel committed, but judging from the web site, it no longer seems to be a priority. We’re starting to feel forgotten out here. What is the status of this project?

<content:encoded>I have a different take on this.  The military should be standing up for themselves.  Who is Washington to tell these men they must accept LGBTQs, and fly rainbows, or stand there defenseless and take whatever happens!  This is silly!  The white house says?  The pentagon says?  They treat the military like dogs.  Do as we say.  Cut their pay, and benefits.  Give the worst treatment in their hospitals.  PTSD, depression, homeless, Washington could care less!  You should be top priority, and not out fighting wars for worthless polititions, who screw it all up years later, anyway!  So, who the hell cares what they say, when they say things like “you will not have the means to defend yourself”!  The military should be standing up for themselves!  What are they, a bunch of pansies, or are they fighters!  Do we want pansies fighting our wars, or real men!  LGBTQs flying rainbows, or men who aren’t afraid of anything!  How about fighting for America (and each other), and setting things right!  How about you stop fighting for the NWO folks, and start fighting for America!  You swore an oath — to America!  It’s our duty to fight wrongs, and to rebel against evil, it’s your duty too!
<p>Go read the Declaration of Independence. This came in the first year of the Revolutionary War with Britain.  Let it now lead us to revolution again, and let us abolish the leviathan that has become our central government.  Let us reset it to its Constitutional limits, and values.  We have come full circle, and now have a central government that is infinitely worse than Britain ever hoped to be.  Washington has failed to live up to its part of the agreement.  They have failed to uphold the Constitution.  They abuse our rights, and subvert the laws, with armies of lawyers.  They fight wars we don’t want.  They represent everything perverse, and corrupt, but not the people.  They refuse to protect our borders.  They tax us to death.  They have created so many ridiculous laws, that control every aspect of our lives, that the terms “freedom”, and “liberty”, are now an embarrassment in the context they are used.  They gave God the boot, and now proudly fly rainbows.  The sign of the covenant between God and Noah, is now a total slap in God’s face.  Caitlyn, and rainbows, are now the new face of America!  We export immorality to the world in tv, movies, music, and porn!  How much worse will it be for us, than sodom, and gomorrah?  </p>
<p>Why do we continue to feed this machine that no longer has any interest in representing us.  The military should take a break.  A week of insubordination!  Let washington know were it stands!   Let it serve as a warning!  Yes, it would ruffle some feathers, and be the talk across the country.  But this is what’s needed.  Washington needs a slap in the face!  The commander and chief might actually have to start acting like one, and display, and convey, the respect these men deserve, and should require!  But, we need more, far more!  We absolutely need to reset fedgov!</p>

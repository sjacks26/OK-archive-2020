<content:encoded>I have been studying Business innovation, Sustainability, real estate development, currently working on a degree in Sales Management, I am an early american descendent both sides of my family were pre revolutionary war, . I have been developing strategies that entail taking an economic crash and turning into a brighter future, there is hope for our future , not that an economic crash is good but life is good and we can rebuild a better country, I have found out things about money and banking systems that blow my mind, if only our forefathers would have known this stuff, sustainability is such an easy process, much of our current crisis seems to be our old enemies the communist and socialist, the KGB subversion strategy was explained well by Yuri Bezmenov a defector who was a propaganda expert for the KGB. I have thought of non profit as well as profit businesses what will super impose a new economy , our current economy is built upon lies and fantasies of a few luxury gods. However our nation is real and not make believe, I studied agriculture and I studied every form of business I could to figure out how to turn things around, everything from a new box office, to a new banking system, a new sustainable super store,, and much more, I am currently initiating come kind of contact to move for a new Army Branch to solve a lot of the issues in current police and military actions to secure the country. I just wanted to let you know that there is real options out there, our nations business leaders are retiring, much of our economy was centered around them, Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, Warren Buffet , Donald Trump, all the men such as these guys are slowing way down and our economy slowed down with them, they started this global empire thing in business, and the bankers followed, the bankers were the followers I believe, they had to keep their money somewhere , their bankers are retiring as well , so we are not retiring and we are not from their family and wont be inheriting their wealth, We need to build things a new way , knowing what can happen when things are done the way the old leaders did things, and making effort to do what we can to avoid the same things happening again. Value what is important , Justice, Freedom, Your Soul, Independence, and the real American Dream. It’s about a real way of life that sets us apart from the rest of the world, making God our standard or banner not our presidents gods

<content:encoded>I was raised a “prepper”. If we didn’t prepare food for the winter months we ate poorly and needed to use scarce cash to buy food. Now I’m lunatic fringe because of my heritage. I spend a great deal of time living in a tent and cruising the woods, then hunt in the fall. I notice that because of the latest forestry practices that it would be very hard to live off the public lands. There is little small game or mast crops as there was when I was a child. Lots of predators though. The only saving grace are the “invasive” species of plants growing unchecked now which really irks the lunatic eco-freaks. Bull thistle, burdock and dandelion from uncertified hay will be a lifesaver in the future. The people who think we are crazy will be the ones to perish and must perish because of their own folly. Probably not for another generation though. I see the survival shows on TV and wonder if these exist just to prove how impossible it would be to survive and thrive in the wild without government protection. These shows usually don’t show the freedom involved living off the land. Naked and Afraid and Alone aren’t exactly glamorous.

<content:encoded>I’m no prepper by definition. Once I was leaving the Buy in Bulk Membership Warehouse and the employee who checks the receipts at the exit asked me… You sure have a lot of peanut butter don’t you? What do you plan to do with all of this? I apologized to him and explained to him that I didn’t know buying a lot of peanut butter was made illegal.

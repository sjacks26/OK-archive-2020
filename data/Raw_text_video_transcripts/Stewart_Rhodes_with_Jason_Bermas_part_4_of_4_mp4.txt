Jason Bermas: [00:00:00] You Jeff in Utah Jeff you're on line. 

Jeff In Utah: [00:00:03] How are you guys doing. 

Jason Bermas: [00:00:04] Good good. 

Jeff In Utah: [00:00:05] I'm watching the Super Bowl right now and there's the commercials are rather really disturbing this time. They've got a Doritos commercial where a dog has a RFID shock collar. 

Jason Bermas: [00:00:15] Actually caught that one actually caught right there. 

Jeff In Utah: [00:00:19] On the guy and knocks him on the floor and people laugh about it. 

Jason Bermas: [00:00:22] Now I know well for those that don't know dogs have two kinds of collars. Now you can get the one where you have the invisible fence. They can't go outside. But they also have the bark collar and the commercial is that the dog takes the bark collar off it puts it around the neck of a human he talks and he gets shocked. Really you know I don't know if that's predictive programming, I don't know if that's getting us ready for shock collars. I do know that they have proposed the TSA has proposed that people getting on a plane should wear a wrist shock collar to ensure their safety so that if you're a terrorist they can subdue you with this shock collar. that could be the new America. It's not bad enough you know they want to see your naked body through the scanners and possibly radiate you with cancer. Now they want you to wear a shock collar. How do you feel about the shock collar Stewart. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:01:05] Oh on the plane? 

Jason Bermas: [00:01:08] Yeah the arm shock collar. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:01:08] That's just absurd. 

Jason Bermas: [00:01:09] It's out of control. But you know what. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:01:10] Why did they have a collar that they will inject like darts into your neck and just kill you. The CIA can just say oh we think is a terrorist. 

Jason Bermas: [00:01:18] Well you know we really are getting to that level with all these uses of drones. You're not seeing it domestically. But it is. I mean I got one of those in my stack where you're seeing more and more drone use by the United Kingdom and the United States and NATO where? Afghanistan Iraq and Pakistan. and then really what I see is a beta test because they are bringing these drones on they're already using them in Miami. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:01:38] Well they also said that they are targeting U.S. citizens who they suspect of being part of al-Qaida. And the question people should have is would that make a difference if they're here at home. There's no there's no there's no legal distinction between abroad and at home if you're a so-called unlawful enemy combatant. 

Jason Bermas: [00:01:55] Yeah and I don't think people are going to understand it until these drones are judge, jury, and executioner. you know because at first it's going to be all we're using drones to stop crime. Then all of a sudden they're going to be the enforcement arm and hey you know the drone told them to stop and the guy didn't stop and he ran we were forced to gun him down. We did want to gun him down. And when we say we've gun him down it's a guy sitting there with an Xbox controller looking at a screen, controlling a drone, so disassociated from the human life. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:02:20] He used his best judgment to determine this guy was a threat. And so you know he blew up the family SUV. 

Jason Bermas: [00:02:26] And that's why we have to stop these things while they're still abroad. All right let's go to our next caller. Let's go to Julio in Illinois. Julio you're on the line. 

Julio In Illinois: [00:02:35] Yes sir. Jason I'm somewhat watching the Super Bowl. I listen to your show and Alex's. quickly this past week I saw the department of Homeland Security at my home town here in McComb that. there was a shooting like a hostage situation they brought out this unified command post. Some of the officers were mentioning that it was a place where the officers come and stay warm. But I looked up info on this and pretty much it's like a cellularized truck kind of like a vehicle from V for Vendetta, surveilling all your. 

Jason Bermas: [00:03:11] Well Homeland Security has exploded in a big way. I had somebody out in Pennsylvania send me four pictures of a new homeland security vehicle in his home town. And what you're seeing is first of all Homeland Security was set up after 9/11 it was already on the backburner. They already had the basic infrastructure in place to launch the program. OK so in other words it wasn't 9/11 that brought us Homeland Security. They talked about it for years. So then Homeland security is put into place. But in the last 18 months they've said well you know it's not really going to be this agency that's independent of itself. It was absorbed by the National Security Agency. That should tell you something. This thing was set up from the beginning to look at American citizens doing things in this country and now exactly as the enemy and now it has been absorbed by the National Security Agency publicly. What's your stance on homeland security. We know that Ron Paul has said if he would be elected he would get rid of that and many other illegal bureaucracies. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:04:07] Well I think he is right. And like I always tell people is that all of the infrastructure is put in place under the Bush administration to supposedly go after Islamic terrorists is now being turned inward on the American people. And so all the people that cheered and supported what Bush did are now having the guns pointed to them. 

Jason Bermas: [00:04:23] And they were pointed to them before. We just had less leaks we didn't have all these MIAC reports coming out. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:04:29] But now the rhetoric itself is coming. Exactly. Yeah. 

Jason Bermas: [00:04:31] Well well now you're seeing it in on the local level in these fusion centers. I mean that MIAC report was just one of hundreds. I mean we went over the Virginia fusion center document right. And I can't remember what the other one was. But I mean it was a 200 plus page document where they admitted yes we are targeting Christians. Yes if you go to this school you may be being watched. If you go to this Web site we are watched. you go to the southern Southern Poverty Law Center site and there's just a total list including InfoWars.com of sites that are racist oh my god. Final segment coming up with Stewart Rhodes. We're just kind of discussing in the break here right before we went on how the First Amendment is more important than the Second Amendment. you mentioned Thomas Paine and how you know. I mean Thomas Paine author of Common Sense very vocal during his time. Yeah. I mean this guy was out there really screaming bloody murder. and you just mentioned that you know the war was won before the first shot was even fired before we even entered the battlefield because it was in the minds of men. I mean speak to that how powerful is the pen. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:05:27] Well as the saying goes you know the pen is mightier than the sword. and nothing's more powerful than an idea whose time has come. And that's how we revolted and won against the British Empire because the people understood the bedrock fundamentals. I mean and before that you had scholars aged like you had you had now I'm drawing a blank. Yes. So you see his name. 

Alex Jones: [00:05:52] While you're thinking of that name, Stewart. I just want to say that I'm proud of us on Super Bowl Sunday. Not like we're sacrificing anything. We're in here concerned about the state of this country and for the real game the real fight for liberty. I wanted to point out that was good to have in you with us. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:06:07] Thank you very much. Algernon Sidney I was thinking of. OK so of course, now I'm drawing a blank again, about John Locke. OK. That was the philosophical basis for the revolution. But that is not a put in play put in practice yet. And so what happened with the American people is they had the opportunity, a window of opportunity to put into practice the fundamental principles of the liberty of the people. But before then the Soul sovereign was the king. It was the Divine Right of Kings who supposedly was God gave power to the king who gave power to the lords and down the very bottom was the people. well that the Founders put in practice the philosophical idea that look it's from God to us directly, our natural rights and the sovereignty of the people. That's what they had a cry of no king but Jesus because to them only God was above them. The people come first then below that is the government. 

Jason Bermas: [00:06:54] Absolutely and anybody who wants to work. And that's why it sickens me that Europe still has these families out there that the queen I mean people don't understand. The Queen is a real political position. This woman has shadow government control. They just release some documents just a month ago saying that she was going to relinquish some of her powers to Prince Harry when he was I'm sorry Prince William as he comes up. These people get briefed by parliament. They can seat the prime minister. I mean they have actual powers that are derived from nothing but US actually allowing it. We give them the power. God is not giving the royal family power I'm sorry it's impossible. It's ludicrous. It's it's insanity it's. Talk about massive mind control so brainwash. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:07:40] So we rejected that idea. we now consider it absurd the notion that some king has a divine right to rule over us and treat us like his property. And yet we have this weird devotion to majority rule. And so they say the majority of the people have spoken and they've elected me the president or whoever it is. And now therefore I can go in and be basically a king supposedly with the authority of the people. 

Jason Bermas: [00:08:04] Well according to John Yoo wrote these memorandums that it's OK for us to torture people you know. He's my buddy. He is a good guy that guy let me tell you. I mean he sits up there. I look at this guy. He must weigh like a buck 30. he's this little Asian man and he sits there with such frankness that no the president does have the power to do what he wants and if we're going to torture people in front of them for terrorism reasons, we'll do so. and in the papers that actually talks about crushing a young person's genitals in front of their parents and then you see. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:08:36] That just the debate. Yeah. 

Jason Bermas: [00:08:38] Well someone brought it up that white paper he's like well you know of course. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:08:42] He said what he said. Well it would depend upon why the president thought he needed to do that. 

Jason Bermas: [00:08:48] Yeah but then you look at the pictures they published of Guantanamo Bay. OK. I mean we had people with half of their heads eaten off from the dogs they were siccing on them. they had the mound piles. They didn't I mean there were some really really gruesome pictures they didn't show us in this country that were published overseas that I have. that they blow my mind to this day. And then on top of those pictures the Senate came out in 2004 and said they've seen video of what happened there and they were disgusted. Those videos were still under the veil of national security. We may never see them. Folks, wake up if you're out there and you're a veteran and you want to do something right go to Oath Keepers.rg and sign up. anything quickly Stewart?

<content:encoded>I hate to say this but.. a medical martial law happens, there WILL be fear so Brandon may not be far off with his threat. if you are trying to quarantine yourself FROM infected, and there are SCARED and DESPERATE infected, it could very likely result in a bullet sent the way of the infected, whether by AR, 9MM luger, or any other type of projectile.<br/>
 so it may not necessarily be ignorant entirely.
<p>you proposing retaliation against him as if you where an infected and militantly trained person shows you are also ignorant, as if the situation happened, you are basically declaring you will just stay out of his range and pick him off, then take his resources which only reinforces his opinion and or fear.  so bravo on the bravado. </p>
<p>as for me and my family, sorry but if we are self quarantining from society to prevent contraction, and you are infected, then you are NOT WELCOME onto my property, end of discussion. </p>
<p>Also how about this point of view.. people self quarantine away from the infected to prevent transmission and infection within their household.. they are now limited to the number of people within their household for OPSEC, fairly easy for a 4-6 man squad to come in and relinquish them of their firearms and or life if a fight ensues. this gives them the upper hand for D2D raids for confiscation. </p>
<p>the best bet, get your neighbors prepared and organized, creates a small community within the area  that can set up patrols and fall back security, and will be a much more difficult to take over for confiscation.</p>

<content:encoded>Please, share this article with all Oathkeepers and Patriots about The Hegelian Principle being used by governments worldwide:
<p>“The Hegelian Principle</p>
<p>Revolutionaries in government have created economic chaos, shortages in food and fuel, confiscatory taxation, a crisis in education, the threat of war, and other diversions to condition Americans for the “New World Order”.</p>
<p>The technique is as old as politics itself. It is the Hegelian principle of bringing about change in a three-step process: Thesis, Antithesis, and Synthesis.</p>
<p>The first step (thesis) is to create a problem. The second step (antithesis) is to generate opposition to the problem (fear, panic, hysteria). The third step (synthesis) is to offer THE solution to the problem created in step one – change which would have been impossible to impose on the people without the proper psychological conditioning achieved in stages one and two.</p>
<p>Applying the Hegelian principle, and irresistible financial influences, concealed mattoids seek to dismantle social and political structures by which free men govern themselves – ancient landmarks erected at great cost in blood and treasure.</p>
<p>Their objective is to emasculate sovereign states, merge nations under universal government, centralize economic powers, and control the world’s people and resources.”</p>
<p>Excerpted from The Phoenix Liberator, January 5, 1993, page 10, column 3.</p>

<content:encoded>Stands to reason why the NDAA came to the forefront in-order for the military to arrest an American Citizen/National without Due Process for as long as need be !

<content:encoded>Yup, its time.  Seek out your unorganized militia and oathkeeping sheriffs and deputize all citizens to act as a posse, and then let them come.   Training us would be useful and women have already said they are prepared to do the same.  God bless you all, we need you, for sure.

<content:encoded>@ Doug, “MARTIAL LAW.”
<p>Doug, “martial law”  and “emergency powers” are the EXACT opposite of the US Constitution.  There is no such thing LAWFULLY as either of them here in the USA. IF you won’t look up Dr. Vieira, read these.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court of the United States, 1866 – YES This IS applicable now, more so then the recent courts: “The Constitution of the United States is a law for rulers and people, equally in war and peace, and COVERS WITH THE SHIELD OF ITS PROTECTION ALL CLASSES OF MEN, AT ALL TIMES, and UNDER ALL CIRCUMSTANCES. No doctrine involving more pernicious consequences was ever invented by the wit of man than that any of its provisions can be suspended during any of the great exigencies of government. Such a doctrine leads directly to anarchy or despotism.”</p>
<p>James Madison: “Because if . . . [An Unalienable Natural Right of Free Men] . . . be exempt from the authority of the Society at large, still less can it be subject to that of the Legislative Body. The latter are but the creatures and vicegerents of the former. Their jurisdiction is both derivative and limited: It is limited with regard to the coordinate departments, more necessarily is it limited with regard to the constituents. The preservation of a free Government requires, not merely, that the metes and bounds which separate each department of power be invariably maintained: but more especially that neither of them be suffered to overleap the greater Barrier which defends the rights of the people. The Rulers who are guilty of such an encroachment, exceed the commission from which they derive their authority, and are Tyrants. The people who submit to it are governed by laws made neither by themselves nor by an authority derived from them, and are Slaves”</p>
<p>James Madison:</p>

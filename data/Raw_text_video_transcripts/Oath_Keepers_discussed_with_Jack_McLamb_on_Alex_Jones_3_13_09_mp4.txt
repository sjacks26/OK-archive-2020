Jack McLamb: [00:00:11] Patriotism is growing among our police and military brothers. Last night I did my whole show on Oath Keepers. This new group of lawmen and soldiers that have formed a group called Oath Keepers. and it's very exciting because you go to their Web site and you read lieutenant colonels and others saying they're absolutely right and I'm a part of it and I'm going to be with you and stand back to back with you on the denying declaring these orders that they will not obey and they're right on target. All of these things are going to be orders that are going to be given. And they're saying no we're not going to enforce them. 

Jack McLamb: [00:01:22] It says here, Number one we will not obey any order disarm the American people. And they say here right after the attempt to disarm the people on April 19 1775 was the spark of open conflict and the American Revolution that vile attempt was an act of war. And the American people fought back and justified righteous self-defense of their natural rights. Any such order today would also be an act of war against the American people and thus an act of treason. We will not make war on our own people and we will not commit treason by obeying any such treasonous order nor will we assist or support any such attempt to disarm the people by any government entity, state or federal. 

Alex Jones: [00:02:11] Let me stop you there. I will go back through the 10 points then we can read more of that. But yeah it's a spell they tried to hire thugs, they've tried to demonize the people, they try to make the cops scared of the public instead of not with the people as guardians and protectors in a very honorable sacred position. and I am seeing with police and military it's like the spell is breaking. It's like there was what I did. No Mike it's like a spell isn't it. 

Jack McLamb: [00:02:33] It is a spell and it's their training because when I was on the Phoenix Police Department the sixth largest city in the United States, we had twenty six hundred men and women under arms and we were taken in for in-service training repeatedly and they were massaging our brains and brainwashing us about all these things. With that with statements like You can't trust the American people out there to ever come to your aid. if you ever need help you can only trust fellow officers. 

Alex Jones: [00:03:03] Meanwhile the media meanwhile while meanwhile the media was demonizing telling Americans is not right to defend yourself don't help cops stand down they'll handle it. So see brainwashing the public not to defend themselves or help the police and to stand down and then tell the cops the public won't help you. Go ahead. 

Jack McLamb: [00:03:23] That's right and this Oath Keepers is not a nation of sheep. They're not sheep they're standing up as God told us to do against the evil doers and taking a stand. And it's very unhealthy in the military to do that. Pat Tillman did it. Made the mistake of telling him over there in Afghanistan that he was going to. He had discovered that we were only there protecting the opium field. 

Alex Jones: [00:03:49] Go over point one pledge one. 

Jack McLamb: [00:03:52] Pledge one, they say we will not obey any order to disarm the American people. 

Alex Jones: [00:03:58] OK that was one that has to be because they're training the police and military to confiscate guns. They're openly admitting it and saying they're gearing up have massive gun bills introduced so again they respond to a real threat. Number two. 

Jack McLamb: [00:04:10] Number two we will not obey any order to conduct warrantless searches of the American people, their homes, their papers, vehicles or effects. 

Alex Jones: [00:04:20] Over the all over the country and I want you to respond to this. They're putting liaison regular Army regular troops in the police department they're sending to patrol America has already started the shooting Alabama. They've out regular army, we had the Colonel on, they're acclimating everybody that this is happening. And in Iowa they were gonna do the drill till we stopped it and they're still planning to do a scaled down one of door to door asking if they can search for guns in people's homes. Go ahead. 

Jack McLamb: [00:04:46] OK number three we will not obey any order to detain American citizens as unlawful enemy combatants or to subject them to trial by military tribunals. 

Alex Jones: [00:04:57] That's right underneath through the Military Commissions Act that says U.S. citizens can be secretly stripped, secretly arrested, of rights, secretly tried by kangaroo court and secretly executed. 

Jack McLamb: [00:05:08] That's right. Absolutely brother. And then number four we will not obey orders to impose martial law or a state of emergency on a state or to enter with force into any state without the express consent and invitation of the state legislature and governor. 

Alex Jones: [00:05:26] That's the ninth and tenth amendment, the feds are openly taking everything over. NORTHCOM admits that to take over governors and states and legislatures. That the U.S. Congress is titular, vestigial, ceremonial, under PD-51 and that they're preparing to take over the state. So that's actually happened to resist that. Go ahead. All these are violations of the oath and police and military do this. Please do this go ahead. 

Jack McLamb: [00:05:45] Yes. And they say that this is an act of war. Each one of these orders or an act of war against the American people and they are right. And it's treason they say in this article. We will not obey orders to invade or subjugate any state that assert its sovereignty and declares the national government to be in violation of the compact by which the state entered the Union. 

Alex Jones: [00:06:10] And that's again 9th and 10th Amendment, Constitution, all the Federalist Papers. Please continue. 

Jack McLamb: [00:06:15] Number six we will not obey any order to blockade American cities. Thuss turning them into a giant concentration camp. 

Alex Jones: [00:06:25] And the feds admit, and in Canada, the US everywhere, England they're all announcing that they're preparing to cordon and lock down cities and the Army War College admits their main mission is engaging the American people in combat. High Treason is how they're responding to that go ahead. 

Jack McLamb: [00:06:39] That's right. That's right. Number seven we will not obey any order to force American citizens into any form of detention camps under any pretext. pretext meaning a lie here. 

Alex Jones: [00:06:51] Yeah well they always say oh it's going to be fun camps for your safety with nightly movies. Local Preachers are going to be in a minute because everything's collapsing and we're doing this for your own good. continue. 

Jack McLamb: [00:07:00] Right. Number eight we will not obey orders to assist or support the use of any foreign troops on U.S. soil during or against the American people to keep the peace or to maintain control during an emergency or under any other pretext. We will consider such use of foreign troops against our people to be an invasion and an act of war. And they say they're going to stand up with the people and fight against the foreign troops. 

Alex Jones: [00:07:28] Now again going back at least a decade they signed open documents to use Mexican, Canadian, Czech Republic, Dutch troops, British troops, Australian troops, I've been in the urban war for drills to take over the U.S. Then early last year about a year and a half ago. About a year and two months ago it was in the Toronto Star everywhere. Congress said what are you doing in the Canadian governments and what are you doing we control this. The military now is starting to use Canadian and Mexican troops and the U.S. and vice versa. And now is openly being announced. Please continue. 

Jack McLamb: [00:07:56] OK. Number nine we will not obey any orders to confiscate the property of the American people including food and other essential supplies. Under any emergency pretext whatsoever. 

Alex Jones: [00:08:09] And that's in the executive orders to put you in force work brigades. Even if you've done nothing. confiscate your food. Obama saying they're building medical centers at the FEMA camps now he's announced that. this is really happening. they blow everything out and make you accept martial law for safety. Let's do the last one. 

Jack McLamb: [00:08:24] OK the last one we will not obey any orders which infringe on the right of the people to free speech, to peaceably assemble, and to petition their government for the redress of grievances. 

Alex Jones: [00:08:36] Absolutely will not suppress free speech and political action which the police have been trained to do ever with free speech zones and more.

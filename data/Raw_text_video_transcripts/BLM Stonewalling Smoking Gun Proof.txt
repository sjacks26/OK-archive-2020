JR: Rick [Barclay] and George, the Sugar Pine Mine claim owners, have filed 14 FOIAs in the past 6 months on the Sugar Pine Mine and the BLM’s claim they have to file an operations plan. A stranger walked into the BLM in Portland and is given a stack of paperwork on the mine by verbally asking for it. (0:00:27.4) BLM has only provided Rick and George 2 of the 14 FOIA requests. Here is the harassment of the BLM and them trying to kick the can down the road and not do their job. See for yourself when Rick discovers the records he’s been asking for.

KJ: (0:00:48.7) These are Sugar Pine records. Rick and George have 14 FOIA requests out the BLM are not answering. Kevin Pruce over here, he got the records from the Portland BLM office, the state office. They sent these to him on April 16. You just went up there and requested them, didn’t you?

KP: Yeah, I just asked for them, and they said they’d get them right out.

KJ: They sent them right out to him. As of April 16, when they sent them to him, George and Rick hadn’t heard anything on their FOIAs. They didn’t get anything until April 22. These are Sugar Pine records. Rick, what do you think about the fact that you have 14 FOIAs out, BLM won’t answer them, won’t give you anything (0:01:39.5) and just some guy off the street asks for them and they give them to him?

RB: I’m glad somebody can get my records, cause I can’t. I put in FOIAs in the beginning of February and I’ve gotten very little back. We have this big package that contains records to my mine, that I’ve been asking for repeatedly. I find this highly intriguing.

KJ: So what’s in the package?

RB: We should see what’s in it. (0:02:14.6) Look at all this nice stuff. There’s quite an abundance of materials here, way more than I’ve gotten. This shows the claims here. How interesting. Something from ’56.

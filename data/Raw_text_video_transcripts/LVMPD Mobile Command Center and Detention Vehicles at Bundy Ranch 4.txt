## Video taken by someone standing on the side of the freeway. In the opening seconds, the camera moves past a man with an OK hat and shirt. He’s on the phone. He appears to have a sidearm visible (seen at 0:01:11.8)

MS1: Wow, they just brought the command unit out.

FS1: Supposedly the cows have all been released. What’s the deal then?

FS1: That’s a paddy wagon

## It’s not clear whether FS1 is referring to a full-sized bus or one of several vans following it.

<content:encoded>@WGP
<p>Thank you for your comment.</p>
<p>It is good to hear another person’s view on things.</p>
<p>Actually my comment was in reply to another one but not posted as such in correct order.</p>
<p>The point I was making is that no man can be free if he enslaves another one.</p>
<p>The European Union is run by ‘leaders’ who made a pact with the devil and the peoples of Europe do not want it.</p>
<p>But they are in the same position as USA citizens i.e. they are disenfranchised.</p>
<p>I certainly hope that the USA will be The Land Of The Free again as the world needs it as an example of a proper Republic.</p>
<p>Thanks once again.</p>
<p>Henk</p>

<content:encoded>@ Henk:
<p>Today, in the USA, we are being occupied by a tyrannical government. Many here just float along not recognizing the symptoms of tyranny. On the other hand, many are fed up with the current level of tyranny and are fighting back through elections and other intellectual peaceful means. However, that does not mean there will not be a day when it is blood that needs to be spilled as the cure.</p>
<p>As for losses of life in Europe during WWII, we, unlike Europe and the Asian fronts, the US was not being governed under Stalin or Hitler, nor the likes of the tyranny in the Asian fronts; who imposed their violence on their own citizenry – who being disarmed could not protect themselves with the guns of the day. Rest assured, we are wide awake to the coming of such vile hatred on our horizon.</p>
<p>The European Union is a mistake that is leading to all out war….again. Nothing personal, but the USA did save Europe and Asia from themselves. Now we have to look to saving ourselves.</p>

<content:encoded>A fine article!
<p>But….</p>
<p>The USA citizens may have felt free but the Korean and Vietnam wars had been fought, suppressing the natives.</p>
<p>And the USA occupied Europe   and is still doing it against the will of the peoples, when it promised after WW2 that it would leave in five years time.</p>
<p>Food for thought.</p>
<p>I do not wish it upon you but if the USA had been physically occupied by a foreign power you would understand how it feels to be dominated every day of your life.</p>
<p>Please do not believe that the USA liberated Europe.</p>
<p>It only entered the theater of war there in 1944 and it was Germany which declared war on the USA, not the other way around.</p>
<p>And with all due respect to every soldier the fact remains that the USSR suffered 40 million dead, Germany 20 million.</p>
<p>The USA lost 780,000 in ALL theaters of war.</p>

Well said!<br/>
Accurate, concise, and articulated quite well, Bravo.<br/>
I will go so far as to say that the information contained in your post is as good, if not more insightful, than the article.<br/>
I have been trying to tell people this for years. Unfortunately what I usually come up against is a combination of ignorance and apathy. Not necessarily willful, but it’s there none-the-less.<br/>
In my opinion, one of the best ways I have found to combat and resist the propaganda is to do as I did many years ago. Turn off the danged TV!!! People need to understand that there is NOTHING of any value on TV, nothing. FOX, CNN, ABC, NBC, they all are in on the con. Furthermore, sports is one of the main ways used to get into people’s heads, along with all the talent shows, sitcoms, and the so called reality shows. Once they get you interested, you absorb a lot more than you would ever imagine.<br/>
“No longer lend your strength to that which you wish to be free from.”<br/>
Question everything and everyone. Always. Believe me, it helps.

<content:encoded>Written by my 15 year old daughter for school. It is a shame she gets it and most adults do not.
<p>America used to be a melting pot. Back before the 1980s, people would come to America for the “American Dream”. Back in those days, people loved the idea of a free society governed by the people, for the people, and no one was persecuted for believing in the constitution. When people used to come to America, they would take civics classes to earn the right to become a citizen. They would also strive to learn English, which was the language of the land. America was founded on the principle of being able to be a Christian and not be persecuted for it. The words “In God we trust” was etched on our founders’ hearts, monuments, and even our currency. This is what made America great. Also part of what made America great was the check and balance system in place through Congress, the House of Representatives, and the Supreme Court. This system was put in place to keep a single political party from becoming too powerful to govern the people. The job of Congress was to serve the people, not rule over them.</p>
<p>America has now become a salad bowl. As more immigrants pour into America daily, they come for a piece of the “Dream” but instead of America changing them, they change America. Immigrants no longer conform to the American way of life, but instead seek to change America and make it more like the countries they fled from. Instead of English being the language of the land, you have a lot of people that can barely even speak it and are not even seeking to learn it. An example of this would be any time you make a phone call to pay a bill, you press 1 for English and 2 for Spanish. If you hang on to the old American beliefs and dreams that once made this country great, you are branded a constitutionalist, which should be a good thing, but it’s starting to become a bad thing. If you believe in the first and second Amendments now you are being branded in a negative way that can endanger your family. The first Amendment is the right to free speech and the second one is “…the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.”</p>
<p>If America continues the course she’s on, she will no longer be free. Lady Liberty will not exist. Each day more of the principles this country was founded on are being chipped away at. Things like honor and tradition are being destroyed because of other people considering it racism or hatred. Nothing is sacred in this country anymore. Communism and Socialism used to be bad words. Now they become our future a little more every day. We need to remember what made America great, because taking away those things leads to America’s great fall. It’s sad when even Russia refers to us as “the United Socialist states of America”.</p>

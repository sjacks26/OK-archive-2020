<p> DEAR LIBERTY BROTHERS ( And Sisters),</p>
<p>And a quote from you….</p>
<p>“Some un-American Americans just don’t get it.<br/>
OMG! they shriek — these miners would dare oppose federal authority– OMG!”: </p>
<p>OMG  WE SHRIEK…..these  Un-American Americans( ? whoever you may be) “Just don’t get it”</p>
<p>These separate and individual Volunteers who just happen to be members of OK or 3% ( WONDERFUL Organizations in many ways!!!) …..would dare OPPOSE us for OPPOSING or questioning certain others who made not just little life learning mistakes…but Openly violated the very Oaths they took and the By Laws of their organization they were as “leaders” to uphold.<br/>
Leaders who are suppose to be, by the very Title or the Positions they gave themselves…are suppose to be ABOVE Reproach!!</p>
<p>Leaders and PIO’s using their positions to “THANK” people for going up on Facebook and swearing and cussing and giving out the private cell phone of a dedicated person who happens to see not just smoke…but BLACK Smoke….and was rebuffed for wanting to be included in the AAR’s that, that individual Felt was up there in importance with discussion about the ( now concluded Mine Security)  Security, Communication and Supply. This Licensed individual was vetted and confirmed over and over and was sent many times to many different “jobs” to perform. Medical with the person who was there the Most often should have been presented…even if the message and CONSTRUCTIVE Criticism was not what the “VOLUNTEER ” Leadership wanted to hear.<br/>
Kill the messenger and you can kill the message ….and lessons that could be learned from thus…</p>
<p>” some people advocate blindly following whatever statute the force of government declares to be “the law”. ”</p>
<p>Many saw people  “Blindly” Following JR ( not the “Dallas JR Ewing”- but they have many of the same characteristics)</p>
<p>and that only IF HE said it ,,,,was it the truth……”If it doesn’t come out of MY Mouth it is “B _ _ _S_ _ _ !”</p>
<p>“Some people do not see any value in questioning authority. ”</p>
<p>Many others DID…. “See …value in questioning ‘authority'”</p>
<p>as he made himself as the main and at times the ONLY Authority…even when he was ‘gone’ in clandestine meetings with the FBI and CIA and “others” ….or in suddenly being gone at the same time when suddenly at those VERY Times it was passed down that ‘ threats of attack from the BLM and Government ‘was thrust upon us. He was “Gone ” or “Absent” more then he was at staging or at the mine. He would supposedly ‘delegate’ and then steamroller over those same individuals or even marginalize his second in charge behind his back…..or to us…….AND even marginalized his PIO as well as his logistics officers.</p>
<p>It appeared so many of them had ‘private’ information on each other….causing his ‘second’ right hand man to storm off and quit.</p>
<p> “Even now there is an Internet chorus of lame-brained quasi-Americans who are spreading lies about the Oath Keepers”</p>
<p>(” who are standing to protect  property rights for some miners in Oregon. I will not link those here because they don’t deserve the clicks,” )</p>
<p> QUOTE:</p>
<p>“Internet Chorus of lame-brained quasi-American’s who are spreading Lies…ABOUT the OATH KEEPERS?”??? ( as an Organization?)</p>
<p>NO, people are not “Spreading lies about the OATHKEEPERS” but questioning some practices of two to four Separate Individuals who may have violated the sacred Trust of so many, and who have most defiantly violated some of the OATH KEEPERS National BY Laws.</p>
<p>but  we can tell you that some of the rumors are very nasty,  Yes, Those “LIES” That they are accusing Some people of….are LIES that THEY Themselves Have told about their former Life Members ( of which I am not one) and many of their Devoted supporters ( As I was at one time, until my naïve  rose colored glasses were stripped off.  I was one of those maligned and libeled and slandered at a Private Meeting of less then 50 “hand picked”  individuals made up OF OATH KEEPERS and 3% AND OTHER “Patriot’ groups. They took the gossip of others, the “concerns” I had voiced to some of them……the Jealousy of and insecurity of someone being labeled a ‘celebrity’ of sorts ( not my view)…and tried to spread “RUMORS (that) ARE VERY NASTY.”</p>
<p> “and some even wish death upon the Oath Keepers….”  REALLY!!???</p>
<p> “who are helping protect lawful property rights from an insane government mechanism called the “BLM”.   Yes YOU ARE! HOORAH!</p>
<p>“They are pumping outright lies and vicious rumors onto the Internet,”  GO LOOK AT CORY’s AND BJ’s Facebook against Maggie Rose…and Passing her Private Cell phone INTRUSTED TO THEM FOR the “Security” Operation….. and then repeat your above statement. And include the “NASTY” “C” word they called her.</p>
<p> and have the gall to accuse Oath Keepers of violating “the law” by standing up for the miners’ property rights and for the right to due process.”</p>
<p>Certain OK Members Violated Maggie’s and Others “Right to Due Process” and to “Redress” for grievances committed against them.</p>
<p>“So the ATF and FBI revealed why unchecked government “authority” was prohibited by our Constitution’s authors and the several States which ratified it. And yet some Americans to this day insist that We The People are not to question authority.”</p>
<p> And HOW DARE… Volunteers…people “question” during and after the operation…JR’s past and present….and HIS self Professed SOLE “AUTHORITY”!</p>
<p>“That is the progressive statist mindset.”  ” And that particular mindset is now making up lies about Oath Keepers.” (this is a lie…it is not ABOUT “OATHKEEPERS” as a Whole or as a Organization…..it is questioning the blind Following of a person with deceptive practices and deceit and “Secrets” and pulling in others to blindly follow without question.</p>
<p>“Even now there is an Internet chorus of lame-brained quasi-Americans ”</p>
<p>“You can read the article by Jason Van Tatenhove of The Liberty Brothers Radio staff, who went there “boots on the ground” to film this interview”</p>
<p>“Some people do not see any value in questioning authority”</p>
<p>FROM THE OATHKEEPERS NATIONAL AND JOCO/OREGON CHAPTER WEBSITES:</p>
<p>“10. We will NOT obey any orders which infringe on the right of the people to free speech, to peaceably assemble, and to petition their government,”  ( OR LOCAL MEMBERSHIP/NON PROFIT organizations) ” for a redress of grievances. ”<br/>
“There would have been no American Revolution without fiery speakers and writers such as James Otis, Patrick Henry, Thomas Paine, and Sam Adams “setting brushfires of freedom in the minds of men.”</p>
<p>Patrick Henry: “Give me Liberty, or Give me DEATH!”</p>
<p>“Tyrants know that the pen of a man such as Thomas Paine can cause them more damage than entire armies, and thus they always seek to suppress the natural rights of speech, association, and assembly. Without freedom of speech, ”</p>
<p>“the people will have no recourse but to arms. Without freedom of speech and conscience, there is no freedom.”<br/>
“Therefore, we will not obey or support any orders to suppress or violate the right of the people to speak, associate, worship, assemble, communicate, or petition …….. for the redress of grievances.”</p>

<p>Many of us had “BOOTS ON THE GROUND: over and over….some were still National Guard, Local and former Law enforcement, Current Reserves and “Others”<br/>
Today in and around 4th of July ……our not being willing to blindly follow “Authority” or ask for a person in Leadership to be “Vetted” more thoroughly……is wrong. You can not Serve TWO Masters…for Title….for Status ….or Money…..or Position.  You either commit to those overseas that line your pocket and bank account…or you stand with your Fellow Constitutional  Americans. We have the right to question and find answers….and re dress for perceived or Real Grievances!</p>

<content:encoded>Why now?                                            How long have these unlawful actions been taking place?      We must stop these federal agency’s  and their unlawful actions by convening a states convention, and compelling our representatives to defund  these tyrannical and unconstitutional actions. And return the land to the states and then to the very citizens that support it. These rights are guaranteed by God. .

<content:encoded>We are indeed a country of laws, a democratically founded republic. The problem does not exist with our country’s system.  ADMINISTRATIVE law, or the abuse of authority through rules and regulation is the actual problem.  If you want to deal with the BLM the administrative process must be dealt with first before anything gets into civil court.  Plus, administrative law carries the authority to do just about anything and thus is the right arm of federal abuse.  This is not to say the federal government is bad or evil, just that if there is abuse it will exist within the various departments, within those who administrate the departments.

<content:encoded>I agree. These agencies that Obama uses to kill the coal industry are operating illegally.

<content:encoded>I just read Chapter 7 in Technocracy, as Elias suggested, and I’m starting to get a handle on “reflexive law”. It helps to answer the question I keep asking, “How can they get away with doing that?”

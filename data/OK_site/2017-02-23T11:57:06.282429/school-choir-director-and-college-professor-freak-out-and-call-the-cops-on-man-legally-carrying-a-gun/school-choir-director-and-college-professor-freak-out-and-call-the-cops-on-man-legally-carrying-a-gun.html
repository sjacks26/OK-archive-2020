<p>by Chuck Ross</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A Michigan man was not acting erratically or threatening other people at an Ann Arbor high school music recital, but he was openly — and legally — carrying a firearm.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">That was enough for a school choir director to call police and for a music professor to publicly shame him at the event.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The incident happened Thursday evening at Pioneer High School when Steven Lorenz, the director of choirs at the school, spotted the man, later identified as Joshua Wade, openly carrying a gun and called police.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[Update: The Daily Caller contacted the open carrier, Joshua Wade, after this article was first published. Wade granted permission to use his name while restricting other personal information given that he has received death threats online.]
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">As Michigan Live reported, police arrived to investigate and determined that Wade had not broken the law. While it is illegal for citizens with a pistol licenses to carry concealed weapons on school grounds, license holders can open carry, Ann Arbor police Sgt. Shane Dennis told Michigan Live.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">But that was not good enough for one event attendee, University of Michigan, Flint music professor Brian DiBlassio.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">DiBlassio took unsolicited photos of Wade carrying the holstered gun and uploaded his picture to Facebook along with two breathless posts.</p>
<p>The professor wrote in his first missive:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There’s an idiot with a handgun with two magazines attending the Ann Arbor Pioneer Choral Cavalcade, sitting in the tenth row. Police came in droves, escorted him out to interview him in the hallway and could do nothing based on his permit. He’s now back listening to 8th grade girls singing Hey Jude. My first experience witnessing this ridiculous show of…I don’t know what. Who does this at an event with 100s of children ffs??? Who does this anywhere? ‘Merica!</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">DiBlassio’s second post included the man’s picture and other identifying information. DiBlassio said that Wade is the grandson of a former superintendent of Ann Arbor public schools.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I decided that the parents of 200+ junior high and high school students might want to know that they had someone with a military weapon, replete with rounds of ammo, watching their kids sing (he was in the front row). After the last song (about global unity and peace, from the olympics. .oy), I got up on my soapbox — literally, it was a theatre box — and announced as much to the entire audience. In the lobby, [redacted], the former Deputy Superintendent for. Business Affairs. for Ann Arbor Public Schools lectured me on how wrong it was for me to disrupt a public event (disrupting people exiting the auditorium?), etc. Soon after I learned who brought the weapon into the concert. [redacted] grandson (phone in the pocket).</p>

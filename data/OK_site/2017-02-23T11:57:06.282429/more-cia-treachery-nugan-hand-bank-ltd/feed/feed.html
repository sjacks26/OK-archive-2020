<content:encoded>Awesome, Edward. Thank you so much for sharing that with us here. I will hit that link this weekend and enjoy ordering the book. What is interesting, perhaps, is the fact that I have met not too many years ago someone who was employed by Mike Hand here in the USA, so I was aware that he migrated to America and took an identity and went into business. My guess is that he was assisted in all that by our cowboys from Langley, and I’ll bet you may think that also. I’ll totally enjoy reading the book, Merchants of Menace.<br/>
Happy New Year to you, Edward.<br/>
Salute!<br/>
Elias Alias, editor

<content:encoded>A new book, Merchants of Menace – the True Story of the Nugan Hand Bank Scandal offers new insights into this extraordinary story and also uncovers Michael Hand’s whereabouts after 35 years on the run. The book is no rehash of Kwitny’s book.<br/>

<content:encoded>An interesting note…reminiscent of Air America’s operations in Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia….the CIA today, when they need to get an agent or two into Colombia or elsewhere, they just can’t get on an airliner with their toys, so instead, they seek-out (reputable and consistent) rogue drug smugglers, which in-turn transport them into the country with weapons, etc (to do whatever) and at the same time, protect that smuggling operation to continue their work without being intercepted and seized. 
<p>When a CBP aircraft intercepts a CIA vetted drug plane, the call is to “Break off” with no further explanation, after the Omaha (callsign) aircraft pulls up on the suspect aircraft from behind and gets the tail number. The tail number is routed through EPIC, the El Paso Intelligence Center, and if the plane is either allowed to work, because it is under investigation, or it is a vetted CIA plane, the Omaha unit has to break-off.</p>
<p>Bigger CIA drug  operations can be Googled, using C-130 transport planes assigned the U.S. Forest Service. Then of course, the Gulfstream jet used by the CIA rendition program crashed with a load of cocaine in southern Mexico….or the almost daily shipments of cocaine in large commercial airliners from Bogota, stashed in long flower boxes are allowed to continue, after Colombian law enforcement stick the box with a long metal rod and confirm the presence of cocaine. </p>
<p>The captain is given a code number to call-in to his operations, and what’s suppose to happen….U.S. Customs meets the airliner in Miami and they do their thing, but mostly…NOBODY shows up.</p>
<p>That CIA black budget allows the agency to do anything they want and never have to ask congress for a penny.</p>

<content:encoded>I remember as a teenager learning how the Queen of England made money introducing Hong Kong to Heroin. Our MSM and our trustworthy Government called it a conspiracy.

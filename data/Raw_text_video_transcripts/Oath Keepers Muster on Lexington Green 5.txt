[First few words are the last few words of “Oath Keepers Muster on Lexington Green 4_19_2009 4 of 10”]

SR: Let the ATF and FBI go do it on their own. Now they swore an oath too. I would hope the FBI and ATF agents would keep their oath. Of course, the ATF agents would probably need to resign their office to keep their oath.

DF: We will not obey any order to blockade American cities thus turning them into giant concentration camps.

SR: (0:00:48.0) In our own history, that was done to Boston. It was blockaded in, they tried to starve them out essentially. The other colonies supported them over land. And Boston was put under martial law, put under the rule of General Gage. It was in that environment, under those circumstances, that he tried to confiscate the weapons of the colonists. In modern history, we’ve seen this. The Warsaw ghetto, where the Nazis corralled the Polish Jews into a ghetto then exterminated them. Whether it’s that or the Japanese Nanking experience, where the Japanese cordoned off Nanking and turned it into a giant death camp. Governments throughout history have had the inclination to blockade cities and captivate the people. In Boston, the people were told they were blockaded in after the fighting began, they were not allowed to leave. They were told if you turn in your weapons, we’ll let you have safe passage out of the city. When they turned in their guns, they weren’t allowed to leave. It took the militia to kick the British out of Boston and liberate the people. (0:02:05.2)

SR: We look at modern history. Look what happened at Katrina. We put a video on YouTube, where we show what happened in Katrina was people were told to go to the Superdome to get help, then they were locked inside, they weren’t allowed to leave, they weren’t allowed to cross the bridge to get out of there. That city was placed under martial law essentially, and they were locked in. Don’t think it can’t happen here, because it already has. Our goal is to make sure it doesn’t happen again. Just like after the Holocaust, the battle cry is Never Again. The same goes for this. Never again do we ever want to see such a circumstance. Some people would say what about if there’s an epidemic or something. Once again, the governor of the state should make the decision about that, not the feds, not FEMA going in there and, as you see in our video, blocking people from bringing water in, cutting power and communication lines, doing all kinds of stuff. They made it worse. They don’t need to be doing that. Let the state government handle it.

DF: (0:03:17.2) We will not obey any order to force American citizens into any form of detention camps under any pretext

SR: (0:03:36.1) The sad history of the 20th century showed just that being done to people. You can go as far back as the use of internment camps by the British against the Boars. We know the history of the Holocaust. You can go to the gulags of Communist Russia, the Soviet Union, where Solzhenitsyn and his friends burned in the camps, wondering what would have happened if they had fought back and not allowed themselves to be taken into camps. Remember that quote? He said how we burn in the camps later. If only they had realized they had nothing to lose and set up an ambush down the hall, with pokers and hammers and axes, against the organs of the state, the state would have run out of organs and officers, is what he said. Throughout history, tyrannical governments eventually and invariably put people into camps to silence them. We have seen that in our own history. During WW2, American citizens of Japanese descent were interned, treated as unlawful enemy combatants, treated as foreign enemies even though they were citizens, interned here on US soil. We cannot think it cannot happen here, it already has. We’re gonna commit that not on our watch will that ever happen again.

DF: (0:05:21.2) We will not obey orders to assist or support the use of any foreign troops on US soil to be used against the American people to keep the peace or to maintain control.

SR: (0:05:47.9) Of course, a lot of folks say that’s a conspiracy theory, a bunch of black helicopter nonsense. I gotta tell you, it’s also been a pattern of governments throughout history to bring in foreign mercenaries who don’t have any loyalty or love for the people. We’re only looking at history. Why would you think history would be any different today than it has been in the past? Those who fail to learn from history, guess what happens to them. They’re doomed to repeat it.

DF: (0:06:22.1) We will not obey any orders to confiscate the property of the American people, including food and other essential supplies

SR: (0:06:40.6) Once again, throughout history, deprivation of food has always been a weapon of war. We’ve seen in recent history mass starvation, intentional starvation, of those the state sees as an opponent, whether it’s a communist dictator or a fascist dictator. Whether it’s Communist China or Communist Soviet Union, where they starved out the Ukrainians, all of that stuff happens, it’s happened before, but it will not happen here. Not on our watch.

DF: (0:07:19.9) We will not obey any orders which infringe on the right of the people to free speech, to peaceably assemble, and to petition their government for a redress of grievances.

SR: (0:07:43.8) Tyrants well know that the pen of a man like Thomas Paine, or the fiery speech of a man like Patrick Henry can be more dangerous to them than entire armies. They will always attempt to chill, suppress, and silence you. I have received emails from people who say we are with you but I am afraid to stand up and speak out. How can it be that in the USA, there are people who are afraid to speak, because they’re afraid of persecution, they’re afraid of being singled out, they’re afraid of being on some list? You know what our answer should be? We’re all on the list. Put us all on the list. Make it so the list is so big there are 350 million names on it. (0:08:46.4) Apparently, now veterans are already on the list. You might as well step up and say yeah I’m on that list, go right ahead and put me on that list. I cannot believe my eyes when I saw that DHS report that said that veterans returning home from combat who have fought for this country are now security threats. When they’re across the ocean serving their country, they’re considered heroes. But when they come home, now they’re considered potential terrorists. We saw a video posted on YouTube last night by a young current active duty soldier. He’s fighting mad. His video is on our blog now. He said, look, I cannot believe my eyes, like I just said, I can’t believe this, that you would think because of my knowledge, because of what I know how to do, that I’m gonna come home and be a threat to the American people. Shame! That’s right. Those of you who put us on that list, he said, you should worry about us only because we oppose what you are trying to do to our republic. (0:10:10.7) What I believe he means by that is that we the veterans and current serving military are no threat to you the people of this country. We are your protectors. We are the guardians of this republic. The only time the veterans and military of this nation would ever take up arms here on US soil would be to defend the people against those who would enslave them.

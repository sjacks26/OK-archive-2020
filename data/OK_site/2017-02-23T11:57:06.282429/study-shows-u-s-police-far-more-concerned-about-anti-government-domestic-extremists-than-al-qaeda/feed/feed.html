<content:encoded>I would just like to thank you for an outstanding post. Vieira has the answers, imo. Love his books. In fact, I’d like to just link now to one of his more powerful tomes, a small but power-packed book entitled
<p> “<strong>Three Rights</strong>“.</p>
<p>(Order it from the “Auriga Distribution Group” at this link) —<br/>

<content:encoded>So we must ask ourselves, how has the greatest free country in world history fallen so quickly to lovingly embrace the ravages of socialist ideologies? Perhaps It may be due to a desensitization of moral values through media and the social nurturing of individual self gratification. No God, no family, no country, no morals – equals a very unhealthy emphasis and trend towards a misguided mindset based solely upon individual self-gratification. For the better of the one and not the whole. All for one and none for all! Herein lies the United States current conundrum. While we are so busy tending to our greedy selfism the U.S. Government is having a feeding frenzy off of this distraction and building tombs into which our liberties shall be buried to rest and nevermore to be resuscitated. 
<p>A government does what it can, by any means necessary (DHS), to reproduce itself and grow. And, like a viral infection (or zombie apocalypse), governments attempt to infect (and will violently attack) every living cell of the host nation until all facets of the populace host are irreversibly infected. This is the very plague of power the American forefathers spoke so vehemently against.</p>
<p>So very much like WWII under Hitler’s regime we can see very vivid similarities to the SS and our new DHS. The government knows the populace is afraid of its all encompassing might and uses that fear to grow more powerful. Obama and his executive orders are single handedly decimating every freedom and liberty from every U.S. citizen yet know one seems to care to say a word. What a power trip that must be for the White House. </p>
<p>There will always be those who despise freedom and liberty. There is always someone waiting in the wings to do us harm. We must be continually vigilant in protecting our precious rights from tyranny and injustice from all enemies both foreign and domestic. Our first thought is to seek revenge upon those who wish us harm but that would make us no better than them. However, there is a more powerful tool each citizen can use and that is a mass protest from every citizen that has a voice to speak now before it is too late. We the people own this country and it is time to stand upright.</p>
<p>“The declaration “when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce the [ People ] under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government” affirms, not only an explicit right and duty, but also an implicit power, of “the People”. But not, quite revealingly, a privilege – for a privilege is the opposite of a duty; and because, under the posited circumstances, it is “their duty to throw off such Government”, “the People cannot be free or at liberty not to do so. On the other side, because every “Government” is no more than a mere creature and instrument of “the People”, and it is “the [ People’s] duty, to throw off [an abusive] Government”, then no “such Government” can claim either a right or a power to oppose ”the People’s” fulfillment of that duty. Indeed, because it is “the People’s” “right” under “the Laws of Nature and of Nature’s God” to “throw off such Government”, it is the correlative duty of every “such Government” to allow itself to be “throw[n] off.” Any resistance interposed against “the People” is fundamentally unlawful. Thus “the People’s “ “right” and “duty” imply an absolute immunity from interference by rogue public officials and a correlative absolute disability in those officials.” ~<br/>

<content:encoded>This government created al Qaeda and later ISIS, armed and financed these terrorist groups and use them like a dangerous rattle snake a killer would use by placing the snake in their enemy’s bed while avoiding being accused of murder/assassination, even though THEY own the snake ! THEY fear us, the people, because THEY know THEY are guilty of treason. Wake-up military and law enforcement….you will become the rattle snake if you don’t get your heads out of the sand.

<content:encoded>“U.S. law enforcement agencies rank the threat of violence from anti-government  extremists higher than…”
<p>So do I.  </p>
<p>The difference is that I, and many others, stand for the legitimate government, our Constitutional Republic that they took an Oath to “support and defend”, while U.S. law enforcement agencies are working to bring our nation down from within – KNOWINGLY or not. </p>
<p>THEY need to start understanding that they are the “anti-government  extremists” at this time, that it is their actions that is working against our nation as was done in Hitler’s Germany</p>
<p>ALL Law enforcement are REQUIRED by the Oath to defend the Constitution of the United States of America from all enemies domestic and foreign, not to become one. Their actions when they “just follow orders” and “just do their jobs” make them the *terrorists BEING USED by those who wish to destroy our nation from within.</p>
<p>Law Enforcement, WAKE UP!!<br/>
Stop being used. </p>
<p>Reread your Oath of Office, as taking and KEEPING IT is your ONLY lawful authority. Read the US Constitution and you will see that it REQUIRES that those that serve within our governments are to use the Militia of the several states.  That you are working in our place as our Militia replacements, but now are working against our nation instead of keeping the Oath – unknowingly or not. </p>
<p>America needs you; it needs you to WAKE UP, and not let them make traitors of you, and it needs you to start doing your LAWFUL duty.  If it is too dangerous for you to follow the US Constitution where you work – and at some places your “brothers” will assist in your death be it by not coming when assistance is needed, etc.  Leave and work for a constitutional Sheriff (cspoa.org has a list), or quit completely and become the constitutionally required Militia, as being trained would make you part of the organized Militia which is greatly needed today.</p>
<p>“74 percent reported anti-government extremism as one of the top three terrorist threats in their jurisdiction”</p>
<p>That is the FBI, do the research. If I remember correctly there is like 2 “terrorist” type events that were here within the USA that were NOT finally traced back to the FBI, etc in the last 50 years.</p>
<p>“39 percent listed extremism connected with Al Qaeda or like-minded terrorist organizations”</p>
<p>That would be the CIA who created them, and many of those who serve within our general government who are arming, supplying, etc them</p>
<p>* 28 C.F.R. Section 0.85 Terrorism is defined as “the unlawful use of force and violence against persons or property to intimidate or coerce a government, the civilian population, or any segment thereof, in furtherance of political or social objectives”. </p>
<p>“… who share a “fear that government will confiscate firearms” and a “belief in the approaching collapse of government and the economy.””</p>
<p>Hurricanes Sandy and Katrina? What about Boston? </p>
<p>Let me see, so they are saying that “Gun Control” proposed by those that serve within our governments is to actually ARM us? Or is it “disarming” the American people? Because that “fear that government will confiscate firearms” is a reality in California, New York, Connecticut, and attempting to be a reality in the state of Washington.</p>
<p>““belief in the approaching collapse of government and the economy.”””</p>
<p>So few actually lost their jobs and homes, businesses are not closing at an unreal rate, etc? People are not working two jobs – when they can get them, at less wages TOTAL then their previous jobs? (BY the way, thinking LE’s, etc should realize that they are next.) </p>
<p>I would say that the evidence backs them up.  </p>
<p>“Law enforcement agencies around the country are training their officers to recognize signs of anti-government extremism and to exercise caution during routine traffic stops, criminal investigations and other interactions with potential extremists. “The threat is real,” says the handout from one training program sponsored by the Department of Justice. Since 2000, the handout notes, 25 law enforcement officers have been killed by right-wing extremists, who share a “fear that government will confiscate firearms” and a “belief in the approaching collapse of government and the economy.””</p>
<p>The “anti-government extremism” are those that are teaching you to no longer be Americans and to use YOU  (general, all LE’s) against your own country, your own people,  your own state, your own county.  </p>
<p>READ YOUR OATH, as it is your FIRST and lawful duty.  Arrest those  “anti-government extremists” for TREASON who are trying to use YOU to bring down our nation.</p>
<p>Ronald Reagan: “I had a copy of the Soviet Constitution and I read it with great interest. And I saw all kinds of terms in there that sound just exactly like our own: ‘Freedom of assembly’ and ‘freedom of speech’ and so forth. Of course, they don’t allow them to have those things, but they’re in there in the constitution. But I began to wonder about the other constitutions – everyone has one – and our own, and why so much emphasis on ours. And then I found out, and the answer was very simple – that’s why you don’t notice it at first. But it is so great that it tells the entire difference. All those other constitutions are documents that say, ‘We, the government, allow the people the following rights,’ and OUR CONSTITUTION SAYS ‘WE THE PEOPLE, ALLOW THE GOVERNMENT THE FOLLOWING PRIVILEGES AND RIGHTS.’ We give our permission to government to do the things that it does. And that’s the whole story of the difference – why we’re unique in the world and why no matter what our troubles may be, we’re going to overcome”. </p>
<p>Silveira v. Lockyer, 328 F.3d 567 (2003), Judge Alex Kozinski of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reminded us that the Second Amendment is not about duck hunting:</p>
<p>“All too many of the other great tragedies of history – Stalin’s atrocities, the killing fields of Cambodia, the Holocaust, to name but a few – were perpetrated by armed troops against unarmed populations. Many could well have been avoided or mitigated, had the perpetrators known their intended victims were equipped with a rifle and twenty bullets apiece, as the Militia Act required here. … If a few hundred Jewish fighters in the Warsaw Ghetto could hold off the Wehrmacht for almost a month with only a handful of weapons, six million Jews armed with rifles could not so easily have been herded into cattle cars.<br/>
“My excellent colleagues have forgotten these bitter lessons of history. The prospect of tyranny may not grab the headlines the way vivid stories of gun crime routinely do. But few saw the Third Reich coming until it was too late. The Second Amendment is a doomsday provision, one designed for those exceptionally rare circumstances where all other rights have failed – where the government refuses to stand for re-election and silences those who protest; where courts have lost the courage to oppose, or can find no one to enforce their decrees. However improbable these contingencies may seem today, facing them unprepared is a mistake a free people get to make only once.<br/>
“Fortunately, the Framers were wise enough to entrench the right of the people to keep and bear arms within our constitutional structure. The purpose and importance of that right was still fresh in their minds, and they spelled it out clearly so it would not be forgotten.”  Judge Alex Kozinski  </p>
<p>(Understand that LE’s are “armed troops”, learn what you are allowed to do and DEFEND your country from those traitors who would USE you.)</p>
<p>“The real enemy of the corrupt corporate state is none other than, “we the people.””</p>
<p>The real enemy of our nation, our legitimate constitutional republic, is “the corrupt corporate state” and their willing minions who “just follow orders” and “just do their jobs”.</p>

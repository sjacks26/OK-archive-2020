Jason Van Tatenhove: [00:00:12] Hey folks Jason van Tatenhove here. going to start a new monthly installment called Sam's intelligence report. My good friend Sam Koper who runs Forward Observer magazine has also just published the sh t f intelligence e-book and just came out printed version as well. but Sam puts these classes on across the country, he's pretty much the Patriots community's leading intelligence guy. I thought it would be great to have him on at least once a month where he's coming on to talk about what's happening in the news cycle. What are the biggest blips on his radar and what we should be looking at, ways to improve our own intelligence gathering and intelligence programs within our own community. So here we are with our first one. I just did this last Saturday with Sam Culper. And here you go. Sams intelligence brief. 

Jason Van Tatenhove: [00:01:05] Now what do you think is the biggest blip right now on the on your radar as far as you know the Patriot community goes. What do we need to be looking at us as American citizens that are aware and wanting to prepare for what may be coming. 

Sam Culper: [00:01:18] Sure. Well you know the Islamic State is the hot topic right now and we know there are sympathizers, sympathizers. There are all sorts of terrorist organizations already in America. and I mean that that's important. and I certainly don't expect any catastrophic attacks. We may see something like Paris, what's typically called a swarm attack, even though Paris doesn't exactly fit the bill. but a swarm attack is a distributed terrorist attack. in India several years ago I think that was 0 8 or maybe 0 9. There's just a group of Islamic terrorists who are armed with AK 47s and grenades and other things. And I think there is another attack like that in Africa maybe Nigeria, but they just ran around a mall or a hotel and started shooting to much people. And it was so chaotic. The police really couldn't have a uniform response. And because these guys will be here one moment and then you know down the street the next or another location in the next hour. As far as catastrophic goes from terrorism, that's probably where we are most vulnerable is to a swarm attack like that. 

Jason Van Tatenhove: [00:02:31] Now I would say let me ask you this real quick Sam. We see New York City right now actually has opened a liaison office to to Paris and France. And we see them on high alert and very big police presence, militarized police presence in the street. Do You think that's overboard or do you think that strategically think they're doing a good thing there. 

Sam Culper: [00:02:49] In New York. Well I'll tell you it. I saw where de Blasio, Mayor de Blasio said that they are ready for a terrorist attack. The reality is they can't even stop street mugging in broad daylight. So I really have to question just how ready they are. I don't think anyone can actually be ready for a terrorist attack because they attack soft targets. And so unless you have a you know unless you have massive police presence on every single corner and every single department store in every single office building and every single hospital all over the place, you're really not going to be prepared. So and in really the best way to prepare, although progressive and socialist and liberals don't want it can't just can't acknowledge just but again because their ideology informs the reality. Having armed good Samaritans is the way to go. You know that's the way to defend against a distributed attack is to have a distributed defense. So you know like a swarm attack. that's probably the best thing that we can do to be prepared just be armed and be Village vigilant. I still say you know a terrorist attack is I think still pretty low in the scheme of things. You know we may have lone wolf attacks. And as far as an impact it's going to have a much larger psychological impact than it is actually going to have a physical impact. And of course we don't want any loss of life. But I, I would say I mean that's that's important, that's on my radar. But that's probably not my top concern right this second. 

Jason Van Tatenhove: [00:04:29] How likely do you think it is that they have the ability to reach out and touch us here in America as they have in France. Is that something you're actively working towards? Do you think they're already there where they could pull off something like that here or is that just it will in the future? 

Sam Culper: [00:04:44] Well OK the Islamic state them they look. We saw this massive change from al Qaeda after after 9/11. They said we're going to start trying to train people, train a team and insert them into other countries. Instead what we're going to do is allow these individuals to self radicalize. They realize the more they communicate especially internationally the more they communicate, the higher their profile rises. And so what they want to do is cut out all communications. So what they're effectively doing is propaganda by deed. OK so the Paris attacks, propaganda by deed. the shootings the Chattanooga shooting, the Fort Hood shooting. You know the Boston bombing all these things are propaganda by deed. These aren't large sophisticated you know operations with weeks worth of planning you know. So really the danger there is that two to five people, ten people who don't talk on the phone could really do some damage. and it really it kind of goes under the radar because if you don't communicate through e-mail or telephone then you take away the surveillance state's ability to catch you. Did that answer your question? 

Jason Van Tatenhove: [00:06:05] Yeah I mean so basically you're saying it could be that the potential is there right now. We just we don't know because we don't have the intelligence right. 

Sam Culper: [00:06:12] It's not a potential. Those things have happened in the past. There are potentials 100 percent. it's acknowledged it's it's real it's just. it's you. it's not something you can predict, it's not something that says you know we can say oh in the next 90 days we're going to have an attack. Who knows. It could be the next nine hours. We don't know. 

Jason Van Tatenhove: [00:06:31] But eventually you think that the I mean just by the model that they've set up now they have the ability to do it right now. 

Sam Culper: [00:06:37] This is going to continue throughout the rest of our lifetimes. 

Jason Van Tatenhove: [00:06:42] Got you. Well what is the biggest blip on your radar if it's not ISIS and ISIL What is the biggest blip right now. 

Sam Culper: [00:06:49] Probably still cyber terrorism or a cyber attack. We know we're vulnerable. This stuff keeps going on. Obama just signed some stupid agreement with China in the past few weeks saying that they were going to stop conducting cyber espionage and cyber warfare against us. the very next day they signed that agreement, We get attacked we get hacked by on by a cyber team from China. Again the very next day. well we know we know that our our grid is very vulnerable. The entire world knows that. We know that China and Russia have the ability if they wanted to try to wreak havoc on our financial system, on our logistical system, on Internet, on on critical infrastructure. All these things. And so I would still say cyber is probably our top or at least probably my number one thing on my radar. Because. 

Jason Van Tatenhove: [00:07:47] Sorry go ahead. 

Sam Culper: [00:07:48] Yes. Because Russia that Russia does not want to get into a conventional war. The losses are going to be too high. China doesn't want to get into a conventional war because the losses are going to be too high. We still have technologically superior and not in all cases but in many cases, maybe most cases. But but what they're going to do and what they've been doing is pursuing asymmetric attacks. And that's where you know if you punch me in the face I'm going to call your wife and get you in trouble. OK that's an example of an asymmetric attack. I'm still going to attack him. We're going to cause you pain. I'm just not going to punch you back. And so you know I think cyber where we're extremely vulnerable is is probably our my top my top risk right now. 

Jason Van Tatenhove: [00:08:36] Now when you talk about cyber attack in the grid, could they perpetrate like an EMP style event. I mean could they take down our power grid much like an EMP would or would it be more localized I mean I've been reading. The reason I bring that up. I'm reading one year later which is the second book, The follow up to one second after, one year after I guess is what it is. And man they just it's a scary situation having that power grid go down. I mean we're looking at you know 90 percent of the population dying off within a year. And people I think it just aren't ready for that is. could they actually do something like that with just a cyber attack. 

Sam Culper: [00:09:12] Or cyber attack. Yes I would say you know I think in EMP is a relatively low likelihood because it's you've got one shot. I mean if North Korea, let's just say as many suspect. let's just say that North Korea has that capability and they may. if it fails, if it doesn't work and or if it doesn't cripple us if you know. if they if the effects aren't as intended the regime is gone. And so that's you know our our response and global response I think is is a limiting factor there to the likelihood of something like that happening. I will say one caveat to that is if national sovereignty is threatened. if we threaten national sovereignty of Russia I think we could experience some catastrophic event. We could if we threaten the national sovereignty of China. They're in the same circumstances. I don't expect them to have a measured scaled response. as far as an EMP being launched, I say low likelihood. The effects of EMP through a through a sustained sustained cyber attack certainly can happen. 

Jason Van Tatenhove: [00:10:35] OK. Good to know. I didn't realize that they could actually you know pull down the whole grid like that. And it's definitely something to think about because I know that now my life wouldn't be as altered as it once was, but you know for most Americans having that electricity go out especially during the winter time is going to be just a world changing event. We're we're so used to electricity and having that power grid that I see it as a likely target and pretty scary to think about. 

Sam Culper: [00:11:06] Sure. You know. I you know I can I'm just being longwinded sometimes. But the SCADA system, I forget exactly what it stands for. I've bunch of your engineering friends have been telling me that. But the SCADA system is just what allows power plants to talk to the grids. OK it's all based off the Internet. So if they can get out to the internet then adversaries can get in through the Internet. And so that's problematic for us. That's one of our vulnerabilities for sure. It's a slam dunk case. It could happen. I mean it's it's a realistic threat. 

Jason Van Tatenhove: [00:11:43] All right. And really not one that we can prepare much for other than making sure we have the basis of of you know heat, food, shelter, all that squared away and able to work without electricity really. 

Sam Culper: [00:11:57] Absolutely. 

Jason Van Tatenhove: [00:11:58] All right Sam. Well we appreciate you coming on. I definitely want to have you on regularly to talk about what you feel are the biggest blips on your radar for the Patriot community out there. And I love the work you're doing. Thank you so much for putting it out there. You're one of the only people actually putting forth this notion of of learning intelligence and it's great. I think we need it and we sure hope everyone else checks you out as well. 

Sam Culper: [00:12:27] All right Jason we'll thank you for the time. I'm glad to do it if you need anything else on an e-mail or phone call away. Thank you. 

Jason Van Tatenhove: [00:12:32] All right.

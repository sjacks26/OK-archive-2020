<p>The US is training and supplying so-called “moderate rebels” who then defect to ISIS. Of course ISIS, like Al-Qaeda, is a US invention. So, why would we be supporting ISIS? To create chaos, which is what the NWO/Globalist psychopaths want. Remember, “Order out of chaos”. – Shorty Dawkins, Associate Editor.</p>

<p>by Tony Cartalucci</p>
<p><b>January 16, 2015 </b>(<a href="http://journal-neo.org/2015/01/16/us-is-preparing-up-to-5k-militants-that-would-flee-to-isil/" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://journal-neo.org/2015/01/16/us-is-preparing-up-to-5k-militants-that-would-flee-to-isil/', 'Tony Cartalucci – NEO');" target="_blank" title="Journal">Tony Cartalucci – NEO</a>) – Reported along the peripheries of the Western media, it was reported recently that some 3,000 so-called “moderate rebels” of the “Free Syrian Army” <a href="http://www.almasdarnews.com/article/3000-fsa-fighters-defect-isis-qalamoun-mountains/" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.almasdarnews.com/article/3000-fsa-fighters-defect-isis-qalamoun-mountains/', 'had defected to the “Islamic State” (ISIS)');" target="_blank">had defected to the “Islamic State” (ISIS)</a>.  While not the first time so-called “moderates” have crossed over openly to Al Qaeda or ISIS, it is one of the largest crossovers that has occurred.</p>
<p>With them, these 3,000 fighters will bring weapons, cash, equipment, and training provided to them by Saudi Arabia, Qatar, the United States, the UK, and perhaps most ironic of all in the wake of the recent terror attack in Paris, <a href="http://landdestroyer.blogspot.com/2015/01/a-timeline-whered-paris-shooters-get.html" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://landdestroyer.blogspot.com/2015/01/a-timeline-whered-paris-shooters-get.html', 'France');" target="_blank" title="Paris attack">France</a>. Indeed, ISIS and Al Qaeda’s ranks continue to swell amid this insidious network of “terror laundering” that is only set to grow.</p>
<p>It was an open conspiracy exposed by Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Seymour Hersh in his 2007 article,  “<a href="http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2007/03/05/070305fa_fact_hersh?currentPage=all" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2007/03/05/070305fa_fact_hersh?currentPage=all', 'The Redirection: Is the Administration’s new policy benefiting our enemies in the war on terrorism?');" target="_blank" title="New Yorker article">The Redirection: Is the Administration’s new policy benefiting our enemies in the war on terrorism?</a>“, that the US and its regional allies sought to use Al Qaeda and other extremist groups to wage a proxy war on Iran, Syria, and Hezbollah in Lebanon. This conspiracy has clearly manifested itself today in the form of ISIS. Despite a feigned military campaign waged against ISIS, <a href="http://journal-neo.org/2014/11/01/us-destroying-syria-s-oil-infrastructure-under-guise-of-fighting-isis/" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://journal-neo.org/2014/11/01/us-destroying-syria-s-oil-infrastructure-under-guise-of-fighting-isis/', 'targeting primarily Syria’s oil infrastructure');" target="_blank" title="US destroying oil infrastructure">targeting primarily Syria’s oil infrastructure</a>, the true source of ISIS’ strength, emanating  from NATO territory in Turkey, remains unscathed and uninterrupted. Additionally, torrents of cash, weapons, and supplies are working their way across ISIS’ rank and file through the migration of so-called “moderates” under their banner.</p>
<p>Before this brigade-sized defection, several other “vetted moderate rebel” groups, armed by the US in particular, have openly pledged allegiance to Al Qaeda. The most notorious incident was when terror group Harakat Hazm, provided antitank TOW missiles by the US, openly pledged allegiance to Al Qaeda’s Syrian franchise, US State Department-listed foreign terrorist organization Al Nusra. Al Nusra would assume possession of the TOW missiles, using them allegedly in a successful campaign in Syria’s Idlib province.</p>
<p><span class="text_exposed_show">The Daily Beast would report in its  September 2014 article, “<a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/09/23/al-qaeda-plotters-in-syria-went-dark-u-s-spies-say.html" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/09/23/al-qaeda-plotters-in-syria-went-dark-u-s-spies-say.html', 'Al Qaeda Plotters in Syria ‘Went Dark,’ U.S. Spies Say');" target="_blank" title="Daily Beast">Al Qaeda Plotters in Syria ‘Went Dark,’ U.S. Spies Say</a>,” that: </span></p>
<blockquote class="tr_bq"><p><i><b>One Syrian rebel group supported in the past by the United States</b> <b>condemned the air strikes on Tuesday. Harakat Hazm, a rebel group that received a shipment of U.S. anti-tank weapons in the spring</b>, called the airstrikes “an attack on national sovereignty” and charged that foreign led attacks only strengthen the Assad regime.The statement comes from a document, purportedly from the group, that has circulated online and was posted in English translation from a Twitter account called Syria Conflict Monitor. Several Syria experts, including the Brookings Doha Center’s Charles Lister, believe the document to be authentic.</i></p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq"><p><i>Before the official statement, there were signs that Harakat Hazm was making alliances in Syria that could conflict with its role as a U.S. partner.<b> In early Septemeber a Harakat Hazm official told a reporter for the L.A. Times: “Inside Syria, we became labeled as secularists and feared Nusra Front was going to battle us…But Nusra doesn’t fight us, we actually fight alongside them. We like Nusra.”</b></i></p></blockquote>
<p><span class="text_exposed_show">This group would later be reported by the Western press as having “surrendered” to Al Qaeda. </span>The International Business Times would claim in its article, “<a href="http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/syria-al-nusra-jihadists-capture-us-weaponry-moderate-rebels-1472864" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/syria-al-nusra-jihadists-capture-us-weaponry-moderate-rebels-1472864', 'Syria: Al-Nusra Jihadists ‘Capture US TOW Anti-Tank Missiles’ from Moderate Rebels');" target="_blank" title="International Business Times">Syria: Al-Nusra Jihadists ‘Capture US TOW Anti-Tank Missiles’ from Moderate Rebels</a>,” that:</p>
<blockquote class="tr_bq"><p><i>Weaponry supplied by the US to moderate Syrian rebels was feared to have fallen into the hands of jihadist militants affiliated to al-Qaida after clashes between rival groups.  </i></p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq"><p><i>Islamist fighters with Jabhat al-Nusra seized control of large swathes of land in Jabal al-Zawiya, Idlib province, at the weekend, routing the US-backed groups the Syrian Revolutionaries Front (SFR) and Harakat Hazm, activists said.  </i></p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq"><p><i>Washington relied on SFR and Harakat Hazm to counter Isis (Islamic State) militants on the ground in Syria, complementing its air strikes.</i></p></blockquote>
<p>Clearly however, Harakat Hazm’s “surrender” was merely the finalizing of its growing alliance with Al Nusra.<br/>

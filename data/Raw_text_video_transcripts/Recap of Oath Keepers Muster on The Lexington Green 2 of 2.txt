AJ: Look over here, have you seen this guy? Viral video all over the web. The version my guys found has 900 views. The original video he did has 300k. Here’s one, 252k views. Baptist pastor beaten and tazed by big brother. I think that’s the original. This is happening to everybody in these internal checkpoints. If you’re an illegal alien, you go right through. They’ll even take you and give you a job, that’s CNN. If you’re a citizen, they just start beating you. That’s how they roll. If you’re a gun-owner, if you love freedom, you’re a preacher. Oh my goodness, we’ve got an al-Qaeda here boss. Now what was it like being on Lexington Green where al-Qaeda fought the good troops, the evil American al-Qaeda fought the loving British troops.

RD: It’s an amazing place. They’ve kept it up really nice.

AJ: Where the incredibly honorable Red Coats fought the terrorists?

RD: Right. Particularly interesting. The leader of those Red Coats, he had a big pot belly and his big bottom lip was sticking out. I said Alex is going to love this guy. You do that voice that sounds just totally, British royalty. Put down your weapons.

AJ: [weird noises that are meant to be a posh British accent]

RD: We got a lot of that stuff. You know, there was fog on the battlefield that morning. The guys were coming out, they do the whole reenactment. They actually show a couple guys running back to get John Hancock’s papers.

AJ: John Hancock that degenerate, he dare signed his name boldly in this act of treason against the crown.

RD: That was pretty much it. It was put down your weapons, you nave.

AJ: Put down the weapons, rabble rouser.

RD: They didn’t do it. They stood their ground. They were fired upon. As they were fired upon by a larger force, they pretty much did an unorganized retreat.

AJ: Outrageous terrorist. But then more militia showed up.

RD: Right, well in Concord, that’s where they stuck it to them.

AD: Endurance

AJ: That’s where they terrorized, they were terrorists. Number one threat, founding fathers, evil

RD: There was an 80 year old guy who fought in the French and Indian War. Stewart Rhodes was talking about how he heard them coming, he heard the war drums and got his pistols, went out there and killed three of them, then they shot him and bayonetted him. He lived for another 18 years.

AJ: And had a bunch more kids.

RD: Yeah. This guy was 80 when he went out and did this.

AJ: That was another al-Qaeda. That’s what they tell old folks, you’re done, don’t be involved. Young people, oh it’s your time to party. It’s a little mind trick, that’s how the spells works. It’s your time to party, never mind, don’t be involved. Oh you’re middle class, you’re 30, you’ve got to make money and be successful. Oh you’re 40, have a little fun. 50, oh 60. You’re not supposed to be involved, everything’s fine.

RD: That’s not what’s going to happen with OK. They’re getting all ages of people.

AJ: (0:03:05.4) Outrageous! Rabble!

AD: Something else about these modern day constitutional OK. Half of them talk with multi-syllable words, almost like the Founding Fathers. You get pulled over by TSA, they can’t even speak English. You get pulled over by a private security guard, like shut up, no more

AJ: Tell folks. They had what, like our $2k lens, just ripping it off and laughing at you. Then you. And like going, what is your film about. Tell folks what you told me during the break.

AD: All kinds of questions. They pulled me through, like what’s going on with this camera. He’s pulling off the lens.

AJ: What the hell, we got a camera!? Notice, the more cameras they put on us, including school bathrooms, when they see ours, it’s like ahh. They’ve now made it a law, it’s now terrorism to photograph police. Now when cops have wrecks or beat people, people take photos, they’re being arrested. They’re arresting, they’re doing it. Tell folks what they did to you.

AD: It’s disgusting Alex. It just rips my.

AJ: Tell folks what it was like in Boston.

AD: He pulled me through next to the lady with the knitting equipment, because she’s the other suspicious person, out of literally thousands of people. They had the Boston Marathon going on, it took forever to get through. He was like, what you filming for, what is this. [foreign accent]

AJ: You answer question now scum [screaming in foreign accent]. What happened next? 

AD: (0:04:26.2) Plus I was interrupted by the other one, you move now and put bag here.

AJ: [lunges across desk] You answer my questions, come here now.

AD: Yeah.

AJ: Do as I [weird noises]

AD: They didn’t know what I was filming, what I was filming for, what I planned to do with it. I told them, I’m filming for free speech.

AJ: You shut up! [foreign accent] get over here ahh. You slave, you slave now.

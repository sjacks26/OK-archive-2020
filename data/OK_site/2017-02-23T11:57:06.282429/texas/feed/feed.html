<content:encoded>Hello tobov119,  I had the exact same experience as you in Dallas where I live. I finally hitched up with some at a Field exercise last month. But interaction seems difficult to achieve. I would like to meet up with others to move forward. You can contact me.

<content:encoded>Just found out about Oath Keepers and noticed only a couple from Houston area.  Have you been successful in founding a group here in this area?  I am a believer in our Constitution and would be interested in joining.  Someone has to get us out of this horrible mess Obama has made for the USA.

<content:encoded>Michele, can you send me the minutes of the informal meeting or a summary of what was talked about? I’ve been contemplating joining but missed this last meeting. I’m located in Dripping Springs.

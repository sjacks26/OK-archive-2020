<content:encoded>my fellow americans, i write to you today in hopes that you will search your hearts and find truth. I just watched a youtube video by Pastor Manning advocating and declaring racial war. this is definetly unconstitutional and wrong. 2nd issue, and i undersand this is a charged topic. Inalienable rights granted by god, not government. It is the right of 2 consenting adults who love eachother to marry if they wish, and the government lacks the constitutional authority to say who is or isnt allowed to marry in the given context. this means the government has no authority to say it is or isnt ok for homosexual people to marry. if you disagree, then just know that youre agreeing with the premise they can declare heterosexual marriage illegal. all people have these inalienable rights, not the cherry picked few you approve of. I cant tell you how to love, only you can feel that for yourself, and it would be wrong for me to do so. lets not stoop to ignorantly persecuting eachother. americans stand together, dont agree to stand divided.

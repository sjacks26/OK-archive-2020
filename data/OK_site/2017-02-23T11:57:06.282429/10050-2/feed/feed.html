<content:encoded>Fellow Patriots  There needs to be a clarification and apology from  Mr Stewart Rhodes of his comments on the Priest River Idaho Veteran incident. His statement of the incident being strictly a local issue are inaccurate.and incorrect. This incident was in fact addressed by a combined effort of patriots from both Eastern Washington and North Idaho including elected State Representatives from each state along with the support of the local Bonner county Sheriff.. The  tyranny gun grabbing actions of the VA  came through the VA center located in Spokane WA  This was a regional issue  being addressed at the local level by combined efforts of Patriots in the American Redoubt.  Mr Rhodes incorrect statements in this forum leads people to believe otherwise with his inaccurate comments on the incident.. Mr Rhodes if you are going to use incidents you are not personally involved with  make a point  do your due diligence in researching to get your facts correct, Integrity counts!

<content:encoded>I heard several of the round table members mention the importance of a designated PUBLIC INFORMATION OFFICER (PIO).  
<p>A very important position for any organization to make, Stewart; on a national level and on a state level, controlled and trained by the national level PIO.</p>
<p>We have a wealth of experienced members in this field that could put together an SOP.   Again, it would make Oath Keepers more professional looking to the public and the powers that be thus command more respect from its detractors so as to protect and project itself more efficiently.</p>
<p>This position would prevent Asshats from making it look like our organization is in complete agreement with their ill-fated endeavors like the one that we just witnessed in Oregon.</p>
<p>Think about it, Stewart and BoD, this billet could be totally controlled by the BoD and project our message on a national stage more effectively and professionally than has been done so far.  He or she would be a part of the BoD and in turn protected legally.  The message put out by the PIO would be in total agreement by the BoD and passed down to the individual spokespersons in the various state chapters for public dissemination.  </p>
<p>The PIO position would facilitate our organization’s legitimacy which would overall create better public awareness, counter disinformation put out by the detractors and  better recruitment.  </p>
<p>We have to win the information war and this is the way that we do it.  </p>
<p>We have to become more legitimate in the public eyes and in the eyes of our target audience and this is the way that we do it.  </p>
<p>We have to shape the information battle space and this is the way that we do it. </p>
<p>We have to project ourselves more professionally and this is the way that we do it.</p>
<p>We have to make our organization more main stream and this is the way that we do it.</p>
<p>We have to lead the greater whole of the liberty movement to the same stature of legitimacy by our example and this is the way to do it.</p>

<content:encoded>The need for the constitutional Militia should be foremost in the minds of all liberty movement leadership and members in all of the various organizations that seek redress of grievance.  This absolutely puts us on the legal(istic) high ground.  
<p>We must form Committees of Correspondence to politically push for the reformation of the constitutional Militia in the various states and Committees of Safety in those states to back up the demands made to the various state legislatures and governors.  </p>
<p>The 3% movement and other Militia organizations already have a start on the concept of Committees of Safety but have no real direction or actual legal legitimacy.  </p>
<p>By combining these two peoples constitutional functions with the dedicated goal and the concerted effort to revitalize the constitutional Militia, could the constitutional Militia all across the country not be realized sooner?  </p>
<p>It certainly lends to a more legal and public legitimacy for the Militia movement.  </p>
<p>Gives direction and purpose to two important segments of our cause of restoring our Constitutional Republic and a concerted effort at the state level would identify public servants that need to go because of their oath breaking rejection of this most important civic duty of the people.  </p>
<p>How about it Dr Vieira, is this something that you think that you could sink your teeth into?</p>

<content:encoded>I am a physician and had my property taken from me, so I really identified with the Bundys who were having their property taken and refused. I went down to Bunkerville and introduced myself to Mr. Bundy. He immediately asked me to sit at his right side while he spoke. Mormons are very spiritual, as are the Orthodox, so I took this as a sign of friendship.  The Bundy Ranch Standoff was an example of a Constitutional militia, with the exception that they needed non-local reinforcements as his neighbor ranchers had all been run off their land by the BLM. Physicians are in a similar position in that most of us have been herded onto the CMS reservation.  My question is how can the Liberty Movement support the Bundys, even though their action was not wise from a military standpoint. I understand that Mr. Bundy was not that welcoming of the Oathkeepers’ help. I hope that you can forgive him for being naive and make amends. I’m sure the Native American on the reservations would publicly denounce Geronimo, but privately admire him; even the US Calvary admired him.  However “foolish” it took the death of LaVoy Finicum to wake people up to the ranchers’ plight which has been going on since Clinton started imposing Agenda 21 in the 1990’s (Americans have too much land and eat too much meat. The Globalists know Americans are physically strong because of our meat eating, that’s how we defeated the mush-eating British.) If the Liberty Movement cannot prevent the demise of the American rancher, family farmer, and the private practice of medicine, then America is lost forever.

<content:encoded>I agree with Dr. Vieira that the constitutionally REQUIRED Militia should have not only been mentioned, but a brief plan outline presented.  It IS the Militia that is has as its constitutionally assigned duties to:
<p>— Enforce the US Constitution and each state’s Constitution,<br/>
— Enforce and keep the “Laws of the Union” (which are constitutional laws ONLY),<br/>
— Protect the country against all enemies both domestic and foreign, and<br/>
— “to suppress Insurrections and repel Invasions”.  </p>
<p>It not only says this here within the Constitution of the United States of America, Second Amendment:  “A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed”; but also here in Article 1, Section 8, Clause 15 directly with these words: ““To provide for calling forth the Militia to execute the Laws of the Union, suppress Insurrections and repel invasions. </p>
<p>Clause 16 delegates the duties to both the federal and state governments even if they are ignored by those that serve: ““To provide for organizing, ARMING, and disciplining, the Militia, and for governing such Part of them as may be employed in the Service of the United States, reserving to the States respectively, the Appointment of the Officers, and the Authority of training the Militia according to the discipline prescribed by Congress”.</p>
<p>Just because those that serve within our governments do not do their duty here does not mean that the people must do them as is made clear when George Washington said that the people must have their own weapon factories, particularly those that create weapons of war that might be used against us; </p>
<p>George Washington: “A free people ought not only to be armed, but disciplined; to which end a uniform and well-digested plan is requisite; and their safety and interest require that they should promote such manufactories as tend to render them independent of others for essential, particularly military, supplies.”</p>
<p>It is VERY important for all to remember that it is “We the People” who are to, and must, follow and know the US Constitution and each state Constitution while we do the things we must do to remove the domestic enemies and the Traitors from our governments.  It is the reason that everything we must do is to be DEFENDING OUR LEGITIMATE GOVERNMENT.</p>
<p>John Adams, A Defense of the Constitutions of the United States: “To suppose arms in the hands of citizens, to be used at individual discretion, except in private self-defense, or by partial orders of towns, countries or districts of a state, is to demolish every constitution, and lay the laws prostrate, so that liberty can be enjoyed by no man; it is a dissolution of the government. The fundamental law of the militia is, that it be created, directed and commanded by the laws, and ever for the support of the laws.”</p>
<p>Alexander Hamilton, Federalist Papers 28: “The militia is a voluntary force not associated or under the control of the States except when called out; [when called into actual service] a permanent or long standing force would be entirely different in make-up and call.”</p>
<p>Thomas Jefferson: “For a people who are free, and who mean to remain so, a well organized and armed militia is their best security.”</p>

<content:encoded>No disagreement with your observations Mr. Vieira, but what makes you believe that predatory anti-Constitution/anti-Liberty Federal Leviathan or any of its branches, offices, minions and/or apparatchiks, would recognize the legitimacy of any constitutional Militia and not label and treat them exactly as Leviathan does all things, groups and people who espouse the Constitution and a restoration of the Republic?

## Chris Matthews; Stewart Rhodes; Mark Potok

CM: Obeying orders wasn’t a legitimate defense.
 SR: That’s exactly right.

CM: And therefore I assume this wasn’t necessary to form a vigilante group like this one or get people all roused up against their government. I don’t understand your thinking about the government. Every time we have a debate on this show, it’s clear that we don’t have unified government in this country. We have Democrats on the Hill of the left, of the center, the moderate Democrats. We have conservative Republicans and moderate Republicans. They fight all the time. Yet you guys in this strange view of the world say there’s such a thing as the government, it’s all unified and working against you. Where does that exist? You worked in Washington, where is that thing called the government you allude to?

SR: So you’re saying there are no abuses possible?

CM: I’m asking. Where is this government that’s all unified against you, that’s frightening, that’s about to deny you your rights. Who is this government? Give me the name of it.

SR: Chris, the Patriot Act was bipartisan. They both voted for it, both sides. Don’t you think that was an abuse of power, an abuse of rights?

CM: Yes, and it’s being debated and argued about among people in the political system we have in this country. 

SR: That’s right, that’s good.

CM: People fighting it, right. We don’t have to have armed people out there standing ready to challenge authority. Anyway let’s move in.

[SR rolls his eyes big time at “armed people”]

CM: I want to bring Mark Potok in, let him argue the case. What is the danger of these guys sitting around having meetings. I’m challenging him because I think it’s a state of mind. But if they’re not operational, if they don’t take arms against the country, what difference does it make if they have this mindset of fear.

MP: (0:01:24.9) Well I’d say a couple of things. First off, I’d point out that Stewart Rhodes just talked about, well you know maybe this could happen some day down the line and this is a sort of theoretical worry he has or so he says. The reality is that when you look at the Oath Keepers website, the core of it is this business about the orders they’re not going to obey. And it starts out with a preamble, a quote from George Washington saying, you know now is the time or soon comes the time when it will be determined whether we’re slaves or freemen. Immediately after that, the Oath Keepers website says, presumably in Stewart Rhodes’s words, that time is near at hand again. The bottom line is that this is a group driven by conspiracy theories about the government, very much like the militia movement conspiracy theories.

CM: What’s the harm? What’s the harm in his thinking?

MP: They believe presumably that FEMA is out there setting up concentration camps and that kind of thing. This whole list of things they’re not going to do are the very fears that were enunciated by people in the militia movement, some of whom went on to do rather violent things, in one case attempt to attack Fort Hood in Texas because they thought foreign nationals were being trained there to suppress American patriots. It’s very much the same idea.

CM: Let him respond to that. Have you had any indication Stewart that any people have heard your arguments and become dangerous to our society?

SR: Not at all. They’re police officers

CM: What about the Birchers crowd, are you connected to the. I want to know one other thing. This fellow that broke into the Holocaust Museum the other day, this summer, broke into the Holocaust Museum and shot an armed guard. He believed he was honoring a cause, which was that Barack Obama shouldn’t be president because he isn’t a legitimate, native born citizen. People do act, McVeigh and those people do act in this way, sir. Stewart they do act on what they read and here. You don’t fear that?

SR: (0:03:26.6) Not in our organization. I find it offensive that Potok lumps us in with white supremacists. I’m a quarter Mexican and come from a family of migrant farm workers from California. For him to even insinuate that I’m in bed with white supremacists and neo-Nazis, which he has, lumping us all together is offensive. 

MP: Oh that’s ridiculous. I haven’t suggested that you’re connected remotely to white supremacists.

SR: Yes you have. You said we’re all coalescing together.

MP: How is that Mr. Rhodes? How is that that we’ve suggested that you’re a white supremacist. That’s ridiculous, you know we haven’t said it.

SR: Yes you have. You include us. You put us in the same bucket.

MP: The bottom line about OK is that this is a group of men and women are largely in law enforcement. They are given weapons and authority over the rest of us. That is well and fine. I’m all about reaffirming oaths to the Constitution. It’s a great document, as is the Bill of Rights. However, when people with those powers are animated by dark and utterly false conspiracy theories. They actually mention in the section on the orders they won’t obey that they fear that the government will be cracking down on militias and calling them right-wing terrorists and so on.  SR: Which you do all the time.

MP: (0:04:42.3) That’s the real agenda here. They’re driven by fears that are irrational and have no basis in reality.

SR: And what do you do?

CM: Let me stop it here.

SR: You’re driven by donations

CM: What is your fear. One last word. Is there an imminent fear that our federal government will abandon the Constitution, deny us our rights, and even resort to things like concentration camps or disarming the American people in violation of 2A, disarming the people, going around the country collecting the guns. Is that a real danger, yes or no? A real danger?

SR: Yes I think it is. Look at the pattern of abuse of executive power and claimed authority to treat Americans like a battlefield. 

CM: You change the subject. What you have in your documents is will not obey orders to disarm the American people.

SR: That’s right

CM: Do you think these things on your list of fears are imminent and real threats to the American people now? Disarm the American people, detain the American people, martial law, concentration camps. Are those real or just scare tactics?

SR: Those are real threats throughout society. You bet. Those are real threats throughout history. Our goal is to make sure they don’t happen. Of course, wouldn’t you fear them?

CM: Fair enough. Thanks for coming on SR. I’m not agreeing with you, but I’m agreeing with your right to say anything.

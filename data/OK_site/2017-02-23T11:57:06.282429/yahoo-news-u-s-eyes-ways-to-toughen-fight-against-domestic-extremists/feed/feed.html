<content:encoded>I could also correct you on the age, but I really like where you are putting me on that (30ish), so I will let you slide out of mercy.  You are a freaking Madam Curry over here.  You should start an 1-900#

<content:encoded>Yes, master of the obvious, I pretty much stated much of that, but way off on the education and whatever babble you were talking about my paying attention to using commas or whatever on a random blog post while I watch some Walking Dead, not worth my full attention like that buddy. Not really planning on proofreading on a days old thread, but feel free to spend your night coming up with your wonderful zingers in such eloquent nonsense.  I won’t brag about my test scores in those areas to humiliate you further, but you digress.  Again, logic dictates your position and this article are Batcrap crazy.  As far as insinuations regarding my religion, using a soldier’s status to try to justify your position, and my daytime viewing preferences, and my education, consider yourself corrected (as you have accepted through silence) and walk away briskly like you did when duty called.  Give up on trying to make a coherent argument, it’s not working.

<content:encoded>Darn it Elias, you are without a doubt a scholar and a gentleman!
<p>To you DocPetey, I salute, commend and revel in the knowledge that America has people like you two supporting and defending our constitution and our Republic. </p>
<p>I hold you and your warrior husband with the deepest respect and reverence. Every time I hear or read the prose of people like yourself my spirits are lifted and my determination redoubles for the tasks at hand to uphold and protect our constitution even against what seems like unbeatable odds.  Thank you for your service both past and in the future.</p>

<content:encoded>I also commend you DocPetey. Thank you for your sacrifice working at the bombing site. I also had 2 family members that were firefighters looking for their cousin and  my best friends son, who was National Guard that was there when they took my brother’s body out. He cannot even speak of those days he went through. It’s always so great for us to see the rescue workers at each anniversary to give them a hug. As a family member who lost a loved one, we formed a group of our own to prove our own beliefs.Not days but years. We had black, limo tint windowed SUV’s come down rural country roads. We were disassembling our computers at night from the things we were able to acquire …legally filed documents, etc.. Barbara Walters considered having us on her nightly show but later it was dropped. We know a lot but no one would listen or be permitted into the trials. Witnesses of those who saw McVeigh in the building, rode in the elevator with him as he presented himself as a maintenance personnel, family members whose homes burned, some moved after being threatened, those who saw the man (John Doe #2) with McVeigh before and after the explosion. I could go on but I won’t waste anyone’s time. After over 20 years, we still believe in the facts we found. Trentadue has been a huge help in the past few years. I know within myself what happened. The expertise comes with years of hard, detailed, dedicated work of many to acquire the truth. This I have.

<content:encoded>You don’t get it do you 11bCib? People can tell a lot about you and how you think by the words you choose. Your words show you are a US Army infantry veteran who has seen combat, is about half my age (65) and has an extremely poor education and/or non-existent reading skills. I hope another OK will flame me if I have written that reply so poorly that it just threw you off. Can’t you see that it was General Partin’s faith I was referring to? You can believe what you want to believe my boy, but the general has an incredible resume and no reason to shade the truth.  Physics is what it is. 
<p>I am sorry, I have no time to school you on all the subtleties of thought and language required for you to keep up on this page. You and your ‘buds’ could learn a lot by hanging around this group and others like it. Furthermore you can’t bail on something you are not part of and you are right I did make up that KooKoo word…..there is no way the words I would have chosen to lay on you would have gotten by our gatekeeper Elias. </p>
<p>By writing posting here we are both submitting ourselves and our ideas for judgement. I stand with what I said, and will say, and will accept the judgement of the OK community. Here is my judgement: You may be the most heroic, bad-ass, grunt since Audie Murphy, but your reading, writing, and comprehension skills need a lot of work.  </p>
<p>This forum is not the rifle range or the ‘sandbox.’ What we are doing here is exchanging information and ideas. “Maggie’s Drawers” is all I see when you cut loose here. </p>
<p>The only reason I spent my valuable (to me) time responding to your disjointed post is I have a number of fine, highly respected friends, who share your service, MOS, and combat pedigree.</p>

<content:encoded>Sun Tzu, thank you for repeating what I just said. I believe that Timothy McVeigh did it with the help of others in the white identity movement.  Now, besides that, what are you talking about?  I’m a Christian, why would I have an issue with him sharing my religion.  As a decorated combat vet myself, not sure what you are talking about there…way left field.  Daytime tv?  Huh?  Analysis of word choice?  Are you for real?  I am out, like over and out…sorry if I lost you there in your “analysis “of Days of our Lives. I’ve never even heard the term kookoonuts, like you made cuckoo and nuts one word.  Listen, I will try address what you are saying when you can say it in a clear, concise, non-rambling way.  I am here to help.  
<p>To be clear, if not wanting to be part of this outfit, and after hearing the ideas on here would sign up to fight the kind of opinions expressed makes me a poser or a “insert another made up word” then cool.  I did the research, many times, I do not believe the arguments with Oklahoma as a conspiracy make the slightest since, and astronomical odds it could be kept under wraps with that kind of coordination and trackable events does not make sense to me.  I don’t judge your beliefs, I just strongly disagree.  I’ve also studied the behavior that creates a group mentality that results in this kind of blind belief in things that don’t add up.  That is why I am advising that I was thinking about joining due to the more promoted beliefs, but got a bit deeper and am going to bail.  I felt this was good feedback for an organization that could identify issues that detract people like me and keep it under consideration.  I have done that, really not much more to say.  I have given Eli and the membership the feedback, I will not be interested in supporting this group.  If you want to make up an image of who I am that is pure fantasy, to call me “kookoonuts”, have at it.  At this point I am not actively working/speaking against this group, but you can probably change my mind to talk to some of my battle buddies on the fence to let them know what they are getting into.  You are welcome to continue to try to insult me, but it seems silly for a group that would like more members.  See ya, “kookoonuterybutterymadeupitydumbword” guy.</p>

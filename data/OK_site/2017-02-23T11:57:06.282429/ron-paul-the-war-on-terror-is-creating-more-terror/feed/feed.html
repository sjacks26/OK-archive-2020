<content:encoded>Ron Paul is right on this and has been beating the drum and shouting truth about this and many other things from the rooftops, for decades. 
<p>Pretty much all he has received for his wisdom and his efforts on behalf of the Constitution and of Liberty itself, is derision, ridicule, marginalization and demonization from the host of domestic enemies within, their minions and sysophants and the never-ending herd of useful idiots and dupes; most who only rarely put down their beer can and turn down ‘the game’ long enough to mindlessly chant…USA…USA…USA… in support of the latest crime or constitutional abuse perpetrated by our own government. </p>
<p>Slack-jawed, slope-headed, wide-eyed, drooling-lopped morons who believe they are actually ‘patriots’.</p>
<p>And so continues the fall of the Republic and so continues the advance of the likely unavoidable horrific scenario that will be forced upon thinking men who demand freedom and Liberty.</p>

<content:encoded>All these Pseudo Wars have two things in common; They escalate, and they serve to erode personal Liberties.<br/>
The “War on Poverty” pushes huge finite amounts of money mostly into the inner cities. Mob rules ensue and the biggest, baddest, on the block is the end receiver of those funds. They get them by hook or crook. Now we have the most onerous gun Pseudo Laws on the books in those cities.
<p>The “War on Drugs” saw a huge disintegration of personal Liberties. Search and seizure, no knock warrants, and Civil Forfeiture to name a few. The last is clearly a “Bill of Attainder.” The first 2 are related to “Bills of Attainder.” This is the “Hook” aspect of the first case.</p>
<p>It should also be noted that ISIS and American Gangs are born of the very same Prostitutive Policies. In the Middle East, most countries are dictatorial, and the “People” get what the Centralized Government feels they should have. They are just immolating their governments, as are our inner city gangs…..</p>

<content:encoded>Sargent D.  ——&gt;  I would be elated to hear your input on THIS one.  (yur choice but of course)  Be safe.  Cal, KYMom ….all of y’all.  Read between the lines of this particular article and one seeth nothing but ‘handwriting on an ancient wall’.
<p>btw: In extreme Western NC there are no stores that I went to with much of nuthing on the shelves.  Milk, bread and eggs have vanished (along with a few ‘free range’ chickens from the back roads).  You folks are ‘dead on’ when you say the greatest majority ‘has no clue’ and for Heaven’s Sake …SOMETHING (some form of) disaster hits within The USA pretty much on a yearly basis thus these events are not ‘unforeseen’ and it is a half-safe assumption that all but the 10w light-bulbs out there are the only ones who don’t know lack of water and food kills.  For year after year it’s the same scenario afore every storm …BIG ‘runs’ on grocery stores!  How many years in a row does it take to learn to stay stocked up just a tad?  Can’t be taught? (Seems that way doesn’t it)?  For over two centuries Americans have steadily and purposely have been (covertly) moved away from self-sufficiency to a TOTAL state of absolute “need of everything” (because they can do NOTHING for themselves). Considering what has been ‘all but guaranteed’ to be coming (monetary crashes, no foods, no raw materials, just rage and chaos) must be ‘dead ahead’.  I would rather see it somehow ‘pass over’ …but that no longer has any chance of happening – to any appreciable degree.<br/>
 How many neighbors do you know that have no clue how to change a flat (or lets get highly technical and FIX that hole “on the car” (no need to jack it up at all)!!! – inflate it and be on your way in about 15 minutes or less)?  Nope.  People run to garages just to have a tire ‘plugged’ and pay 5 to 7 bucks (or more) for it.  Everyone knows about Fix-A-Flat stuff but rarely do ppl keep it in their cars …much less ’emergency bags’ (gets thirsty waiting on an icy interstate for hours …and ‘hungry out’ too! (banging head on puter table here).<br/>

<content:encoded>Perhaps he should have listed the USA as one of the many ‘terrorist organizations’.  Our ‘superiors never hesitate to instill FEAR into the hearts of Americans to goad them into agreeing to blow up yet another armpit somewhere in the world.  How bad is it?  Last week the results of a nationwide poll was talleyed: people were asked whether or not we should bomb The “Something” Kingdom (Peter Pan’s magical forest and all).  88% of those asked replied YES! YES!  We should bomb them back to The Stone Age.  (These Americans are all for blasting a fictitious, magical storybook kingdom all to hell).  I’m not sure what to think.<br/>
I could not HELP but notice that it clearly states THEY HAD NOTHING prior to us frigging with them (post 9/11)….which means they, in no way, could have rigged the Twin Towers to implode in the manner it was ‘rigged’.  That was a ‘very pro’ work of art.  THAT is our government hard at work too.  I remember at the time ppl saying Bush did it for his oil buddies in TX.  I dunno about that without facts, but the facts are “in our face” with ISIS and Boko Haram and every other ‘bubble group’ of malcontents hunkered down over there.<br/>
Ironically, they are collectively getting ready to pay us a visit (excepting the ones already here and waiting), and at the same time we are (many of us I hope) are breaking all gun sale records as we prepare for them (or our own government).  Looks like it could well be both “simultaneously” – – as that would cause the largest confusion and thus the largest loss of population (or, it’s logical at least).  Spock might agree?  lol…

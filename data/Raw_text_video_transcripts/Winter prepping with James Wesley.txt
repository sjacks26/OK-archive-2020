Midnight Ride documentary

Jim Wesley: Rhodes & Chuck Baldwin are personal heroes (31 mins).
JW: Martial law unlikely to be implemented nation-wide, could happen city-by-city
JW: Movie lays out legalities of martial law & of militia system
JW: Edwin Viera wrote book the doc is based on. Militia reform “took the teeth away from the citizens’ militia” (33 mins)
JW: Doc will give a “sound primer” on martial law

JVT: Martial law clampdown in Paris. ISIS says that “we’re next.” Do we need to prepare for that? (34 mins)
JW: Definitely. Definitely is a terrorist threat in this country. I feel threatened by my own govt, never know when someone will stage a false flag event. Regardless, it’s important that families be well-prepared. Be armed at all times. Carrying a firearm all the time is like carrying an umbrella. Firearms are like parachutes. Be armed, be vigilant. (36 mins) Be trained.
JW: If you have an extra thousand dollars, don’t buy a second gun if you already own a battle rifle. Spend that money on training.

JVT: OK starting new minuteman project (37 mins). Members who are willing to be armed at all times, whatever you can do legally, to be a quick-reaction force. Require a certain amount of training to participate.

JW: Re ISIS: if you’re not armed, you’re not part of the solution, you’re part of the problem. (38 mins) I can predict that even as early as this Christmas there are gonna be bargain flights available to Paris because people are gonna be afraid to get on airplanes and go to France.
JW: Greater threat is political. Politicians will use the threat of terrorism to degrade civil liberties. (39 mins) Overreaction will be worse than the terrorism itself.
JW talks about his novels just before 41 mins. Tactical tips included.

<content:encoded>Mr. Alias, please correct my last comment.  I typed CRT instead of CPT on a number of occasions.  It was a ‘brain fart’.  I have them every so often.  Thanks.

<content:encoded>In the early 1980’s, I was stationed in Maastricht, Holland and was assigned to the Central Region Signal Group of Allied Forces Central Europe (AFCENT).  One crisp, sunny autumn afternoon, our commander, Col John Wayne (no joke, that really was his name), called a meeting of all personnel in the break room.  He informed us that the Baader-Meinhof Gang, aka the Red Army Faction, was known to be in the area and their most likely target was our facility.  The colonel paused for a moment and a total silence fell upon the room.  We were anxious to hear his next words which we assumed would be our command response to the threat.  Instead the pinball machine blurted out ‘Quit talking and start chalking’.  I’ll never forget that moment.  We all had a good laugh but it also quite profoundly defined what we needed to do.  No more time for words.  This was a time for action.  I think it’s about time to bring out that old pinball machine.

<content:encoded>We could start a Bill.  There are enough contributors with good ideas.  Submissions for inclusion as articles can be discussed and modified to be representative of the whole body of people contributing to this project.  Grass Roots legislative projects can be crowd sourced in a forum like this and implemented in communities across this nation.  Put this bug in the ear of the people we live with on a local level first and grow from there.  This Board, while important as it is, lives in obscurity as far as most of our neighbors are aware.  Organizing small guerrilla teams setting up local chapters is where we fight back.  Quietly and subversively getting the message to the people one community at a time and spread it like a virus.
<p>In response to a call for action.</p>

<content:encoded>Remember guys, We already have an enemy on our western shores right now. It came here 4&amp;1/3 years ago from Japan. Now it’s killing our people &amp; destroying our food and water at an alarming rate &amp; yet our ‘One World Government’ here in America tells us that there is nothing wrong &amp; not to worry. We must inform the people of the truth about Fukushima &amp; the poison it’s spreading all over the world. My source for this info is from the nuclear watchdog “Beyond Nuclear. Org &amp; Thom Hartmann’s Program on FreespeechTV where I learned about the Oathkeepers from Richard Mack’s interview. Please inform yourselves! Rev JAE.

<content:encoded>It takes money to mount a solidarity movement. Only 2000 active members on this Oathkeepers site. Of the “millions of gunowners” that are supposed to protect and save America, how many will pitch in for an ad campaign? Lots of tough talk online, but how many you think would rally with $100 each to shake things up? I don’t think “we the people” know the meaning of solidarity. Too many groups competing for air time or caught up in political dog shows. I’ve got ideas, but it’s not a one man show. How many people really willing to set aside petty differences and stop trying to one up each other to get on one loud drum beat?

[Editor’s Note: I would be curious as to where you found the statistic claiming 2,000 active members on the Oath Keepers website. Thank you.<br/>
Salute!<br/>

<content:encoded>I hear lots of people pointing out the problem. I don’t see anyone presenting a solution.

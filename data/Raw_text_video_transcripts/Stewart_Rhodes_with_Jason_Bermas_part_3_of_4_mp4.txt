Stewart Rhodes: [00:00:00] You are taking back our counties in Clark County Nevada. The 9:12 people who and the Ron Paul people got together in the Tea Party people and took back the Central Committee of the Clark County Republican Party and also the state of Nevada Republican Party. that's now run by constitutionalists. OK. So it can be done. The bottom up it's happening. Guys like Joel Boniec, other other ones across the country. State legislatures all over the place. get the Patrick Henry coalition you heard about that right. It's a coalition of hard core constitutionalist in state legislatures who are coming together and cooperate and look like a committees of safety and correspondence kind of thing but they're actually cooperating. That's where you see all the sovereignty bills all the made in Tennessee gun bill now. And other states are copying the Montana legislation. they're all passing laws the same legislation. That's a very good sign from the bottom up it is coming. It is happening and that's why you have a risk of the elites going Oh holy cow if we don't stop this They're going to replace us. But look the strength is down here in we the people. It's not upside down pyramid. It's a pyramid starts right down here. And they understand that the real power has always been and always will be in our hands. They understand that. But they want to shut it down. They don't want you to communicate with anybody else or each other. So they want to shut down your free speech which is what they're doing right now. 

Jason Bermas: [00:01:17] Well the elite have always tried to really establish their power base above everybody else and control those below them so that they can attain the political office or the the corporate I guess establishment that they've been able to do. You know they don't want you to become Microsoft they don't want to become Google without them actually co-opting and controlling you. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:01:37] They don't even want you to be Mr. Smith Goes to Washington. 

Jason Bermas: [00:01:40] No you cannot be Jimmy Stewart. Absolutely not. I agreed. All right let's take some callers we've actually got someone who's been on line for two hours. Let's go to Drew in New York. Drew you're on line. 

Drew In New York: [00:01:52] [unintelligble] 

Jason Bermas: [00:02:09] I've been on CNN a couple times that I've been on MSNBC. I've been on the History Channel. I mean I'll take it when they give it to me. But it's so few and far between that the mainstream media ever wants to cover what the alternative has to say and then they always do so in a negative light. We're always the kook, we're bad. We're fringe. but you're not seeing that as much on the streets you know again Hal sparks the actor you know he used to be on Talk Soup. He gets talked about 911 truth and he's like well you know of course they're going to use that as a talking point to attack you on the news. But go to the average American household at 2:00 or 3:00 in the morning and they're on YouTube watching this stuff. So they're using it as attack and attack when they have a list of things to attack you on. You know, don't say there's 27 trillion that the bankers stole. You know don't talk about 911 truth. don't talk about the Second Amendment and say it's a good thing. don't say anything bad about global government or the U.N. or the quote unquote new world order. It's OK when Gordon Brown gets up at the G-20 and says that they're building a new world order and that the New World Order is emerging. But as soon as you have criticism for that global order then you're the bad guy and then it doesn't exist. You're a kook and I see that time and time again I thank you for the call Drew. Let's go to Tony. Randy in Texas. Randy you're online. 

Randy In Texas: [00:03:26] Hello. How are you doing Jason and Stewart. Yes. I see that snowstorm up there in the Northeast and I think Damn global warming. 

Jason Bermas: [00:03:38] Well there's another one you know you're not allowed to talk about global warming in a negative light despite Climategate coming out in the news. The State of the Union address, he gets up in front of Congress in the house and once what's he say. he's like well all those people that deny global warming that's a big laugh. It's a big laugh. but in my stack here you know I've got more lies about global warming coming out. And of course Phil Jones one of the scientists for the U.N. who I have his email featured in the next film I'm doing Invisible Empire, where he literally says yes the data shows that we've been cooling for the last seven years. This is from 2005 since 1998. But it's not statistically significant. Then you find out they dumped all of the source data so nobody could go over it. And now the headline is old Phil Jones contemplated suicide. We were too hard on them by actually exposing the truth in this. This maddens me. It absolutely maddens me. And then in that in that story by the way where they say that Phil Jones contemplated suicide. They, what do they associate him with Dr. David Kelly who was murdered. And they call that a suicide. for those that don't know Dr. David Kelly was the one that said yes they sexed up reports that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction and then they found him in the woods with his wrists slit. and then they compare it to this guy right here folks. It drives me nuts. I mean how far off base right now is the mainstream media. How much truth are we really getting from them. STEWART What do you think. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:05:03] Well as you said a little time tidbits here and there. but you know the answer really is the Internet and our own independent you know journalists like yourself. That's that's where the answer is going to lay. 

Jason Bermas: [00:05:13] The thing that boggles my mind is what does Info wars dot com do. what does Jason Bermas do. they go to the Times online. They go to Reuters. they go to CNN.com. There is nothing in here that the establishment, the mainstream media isn't telling us. We get it in you know paragraph 17 page two in one sentence and we say that and then we're the kooks. All right let's go to our next caller let's go to Terrence in Texas. Terence you're on line. 

Terrence In Texas: [00:05:42] Hey. Hey guys. Stewart I wanted to ask Stewart. You've got to 1793 Chisholm versus Georgia. You got Bob Shultz suing the government for bailing out AIG. for a person to take on anything you have to quit your job and become, It takes over your life. Do You have anything on oath keepers to give people education on things they should know, the duties of a sheriff. Constitutionally simple things they can use just to help promote the movement of liberty and freedom. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:06:21] Well right now we're writing our Oath Keepers handbook. And unfortunately I've been I've been traveling around so much that I haven't been able to do as much writing as I'd like on the site so I try to change that soon. We'll how about an Oath Keeper University on the side too, all free links. The main point I was started the very basics. start with the Declaration of Independence. Start with our philosophical underpinnings of what makes us Americans. We can go from there to our Constitution to which is simply the method We the people chose to secure our liberty. And then you go from there and you know read the Federalist Papers. You can read the Declaration for the cause of taking up arms in 1775. That's a very good document to read. I believe 1775 or 1776. It was June of 1776 it was written. So you go and read all these different documents so you understand your own heritage and history and then you go from there. and then you can look at what's going on now and see it through the proper lens of we the people are sovereign. government is by our consent only. they have no authority whatsoever do anything outside of that. And of course you should understand that the problem of our money supply too. sound money backed by gold or silver is what the founders intended and not what they have now. They experience the Continentals. That's why the old saying you know not worth the continental. They experienced paper currency and that's not what they meant when they said Congress has the authority to coin money. and so these are the bedrock things we should know and understand and not pay so much attention to the circus in DC of this party versus that party which is kind of like the Super Bowl. Paint your face blue or red and scream and yell when your team has the ball you know. 

Jason Bermas: [00:07:51] And the other thing you said that I want to address is he said well these things have to consume your life for you to make a difference. I don't believe that. No. You know I really feel like maybe it's consumed my life but I was kind of going in that direction anyway. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:08:03] It's consumed mine too. 

Jason Bermas: [00:08:05] And I would like to think that both of us have done a lot for this Patriot Movement sure but it doesn't have to cons-. Yeah I don't know. I've not enough. You know I want to do more and more every day because that's what drives me. But just because you know you work a nine to five job, you've got two kids at home, you have a mortgage payment, you can still do things it doesn't have to. Not everybody is going to be Cindy Sheehan. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:08:26] But you know what I mean there's a way to do it. I think that that's why you should focus on your local community first. Focus on your county you make sure you get a squared away sheriff, make sure you've got a good good county commissioners that are real constitutionalist. if you don't get them out of office put ones in that are. focus there. make sure you got you know like a said of neighborhood watch and get to know your neighbors be ready to support each other and help each other. And we rose be ready to support the police directly if you need to. make sure that make sure that they know you have their back. A strong community like that you can do that even with a full time job. You can do these things. Join your volunteer fire department or if you have a cert program you know citizens emergency response training. Every state has that take part in that. search and rescue whatever it is you have in your community you can do you should do it. You're supposed to be in your militia. We're supposed to be mustering on the green and drilling every weekend right now. 

Jason Bermas: [00:09:15] Well Alex always says the Second Amendment doesn't mean anything if you don't know how to use your firearm. So I mean there are those people out there that really you know those yuppie types that do have a gun out there they never go to the range. You know they don't know how to handle them. Learn how to use it. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:09:27] They're going to do that Appleseed class. go to Appleseed I think is Appleseed dot info but there's you know a free. It's free for veterans. No I'm sorry it's free for women and children and current serving police officers. for everybody else it cost 70 bucks for a few two days of good and good basic rifle marksmanship. So it's a good program. 

Jason Bermas: [00:09:43] All right let's go to our next caller let's go to

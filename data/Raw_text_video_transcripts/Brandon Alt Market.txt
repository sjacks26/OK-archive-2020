## Stewart Rhodes, Brandon Smith (alt-market.com, side editor for OK). Jason Van Tatenhove speaks a few words around 0:21:43.2. There’s something like 2 minutes of silence and blank screen at the end.

SR: This is SR, here with BS. BS is our resident authority on the economy. He couldn’t make it to the summit, so we’re doing this so he can tell you folks what he sees happening to our economy and what’s coming.

BS: Stock market conditions are back to where we were in 2008, 2009. Massive volatility, 500-600 point moves up and down. That’s a sign of a failing market. Even if it’s up, next day it’s down. Those moves are a bad sign about the economy generally. It means anything can happen. If anything can happen, usually the worst happens.

SR: You mentioned that folks were trying to rally around China, hoping China would do something to help the economy, but they didn’t do anything?

BS: Today, the Chinese cut rates, that was supposed to boost the market. We had a 300 point increase until the last half hour of trading, it went straight down like 500 points. That kind of movement was totally unexpected by the mainstream. When the mainstream is surprised by these movements, especially after years of the Fed pumping fiat stimulus into the markets. There’s a normalcy bias to the markets, everyone expects the Fed to save the day (0:02:23.8). Now, the Fed isn’t gonna save the day, and everyone realizes that. When the mainstream starts to realize the central bank can’t do anything about it, that’s why you start to see a collapse.

SR: You think we’re at the point where they can’t do anything, they can’t bail it out anymore?

BS: (0:02:44.0) No. There’s talk in the mainstream financial news that QE4 should be on the table next. I don’t think the Fed will do QE4. There’s no point to it. If they do, it’s like saying the past three QEs were useless, it’s admitting they did nothing. QE has no mechanical purpose except give false hope. (0:03:28.3) If it doesn’t do that anymore, there’s no reason for them to do it.

SR: That’s quantitative easing, pumping false money into the economy.

BS: Right, printing money.

SR: All that does is kick the can down the road.

BS: (0:03:44.0) What’s going on this year, the central banks know and the markets are starting to realize that they can’t kick the can anymore. It doesn’t matter if they have QE, the markets are still gonna fall. It might not be fast, it might drag on, but you’re gonna see bites taken out of the market, you’re gonna see it drop every month. (0:04:24.2) I know this is gonna happen because certain mainstream media outlets are already starting to prepare people for that. They’re starting to tell people this is the new normal: diminished living standards, falling markets, this is the way things are supposed to be (0:04:51.2). Obviously that’s not the way things are supposed to be, but they’re trying to inoculate everyone to the negative info that’s about to come out.

SR: They’re even telling us that it will be good for us if the dollar loses its world reserve status. 

BS: (0:05:10.9) Yeah, major news outlets are starting to say maybe that’s not such a bad thing, it will kick up manufacturing in the US. But they were saying that in 2008, that the dollar drop would kick manufacturing and industry back up in the US. It never happened. It took decades for industry to be dismantled, it’s gonna take decades for it to get rebuilt (0:05:44.2). In the meantime, you’re gonna have considerable economic suffering. In terms of solutions, people should think of a non-participation principle, which basically says that whatever the system provides for you, provide it for yourself. Whatever the system refuses to provide for you, provide it for yourself. That leaves the system, if it’s corrupt, one of two options. Either they have to admit that you’re successful, that you’ve made a better system and they fade away. Or they try to stop you. (0:06:38.6) If they try to stop you, you defend yourself, and when they try to stop you, they’ve given credence to your ideology.

SR: They’re the clear aggressors.

BS: Right. Basically, you go your own way, provide for yourself, become self-sustaining, yourself or your community. When they try to stop you, when you defend yourself, you generate support for what you’re doing. (0:07:18.5) It’s a lose-lose for them. If you remain dependent on the system, they can use your dependency as a rationale for controlling you. We’re closing in on that scenario right now.

SR: (0:07:39.2) Our great vulnerability is that Americans don’t have independent wealth, real money, they don’t have their own food or security, none of those essential elements of life.

BS: They don’t even have community. (0:07:54.6) They don’t have friends they can rely on in a crisis situation.

SR: That’s where we are. They’re not going to establish a citizens’ militia, for example, so we need to do it ourselves (0:08:13.7). They’re not gonna have a three year grain reserve for the US population, even though they know

BS: In fact, info just came out that they have no grain reserve right now. If you think that the feds are gonna come to your rescue during a crisis, you’re living in frigging fantasy land. They’re not gonna save you, so you need to save yourself. (0:08:48.4)
 SR: So we need to do all those things ourselves. Something we’ve talked about before is having a liberty trade, something you can do, localized, a more primitive economy.

BS: (0:09:04.1) Liberty trade is based on, what are the essentials in a society even during a collapse scenario. If you can provide one of those necessities to your community, you’re in a real good position to survive regardless of what happens. You should think about what’s necessary during a collapse situation, what are people always going to need. If you can train in that, be it farming or animal heraldry or welding or even security. If you are trained in those areas, you become vastly useful to your community. You can trade those services for (0:10:11.3) whatever you need. When you have a whole community producing necessities, you have what I call a localized community or self-sustaining community. That’s what we need, not just one guy here and one guy there trained up. We need whole neighborhoods or towns all training in different useful skills and becoming producers again. We don’t live in a society of producers anymore, we live in a society of consumers. We need to change that in the next 6 months, everyone needs to have a skill that is absolutely useful. If you don’t have that, you’re screwed (0:11:08.3). In the next 6 months, learn something useful. Mechanical, farming, anything.

SR: One place to look is our CPT program, where critical skills are laid out. Comms, medical, engineering, security. You can add to those, food growing, blacksmith. All those skill sets need to be done in a localized economy. Imagine you’re blocked off against the world for 6 months or a couple years, could you do that?

BS: Look at Greece right now. There’s a massive shift towards a barter economy (0:12:11.1). There are bartering skills that are useful. The yuppie office workers, they’re all done, there’s nothing they have that anybody wants. The farmers, the people who raise animals, those are the people still doing okay. Take that scenario and apply it here. That’s what we’re looking at. (0:12:41.2) People need to abandon the nonsensical idea of the lone-wolf survivalist, the lone family on the compound. Don’t do that, you’re gonna die. You need community. No one can do everything by themselves, you need to work with other people. In terms of security. OK has been in all kinds of situations where we’ve done active security in a real situation that could become dangerous. You need bodies to run that security. (0:13:37.1) If you don’t have people you’re done. If you don’t, all that food you’re storing, you might as well hand that out, because someone’s gonna come to take it.

SR: That goes back to the idea of extended family and tribe, something Sam Culper at Forward Observer magazine has written about, John Mosby. It’s something a lot of people have written about, because it’s common sense. We have to get back to the Founders’ ideal of (0:14:07.6) standing up for each other and local economies. Along with liberty trade, there’s liberty garden. Be able to grow your own food, and chickens and goats and sheep.

BS: (0:14:23.0) Start out at a level you think you can handle and grow from there. It’s a learning process. It’s a skill set that’s been lost through most of our society. Back during the Great Depression, 80% or more lived sustainably off the land. Today, those numbers are reversed, even less. Maybe 5-10% of Americans could be self-sustaining, living off the land and growing their own food and raising their own animals. The vast majority of Americans, no clue, the knowledge is gone. We need to rediscover that knowledge now.

SR: (0:15:26.9) That’s why we’re talking to folks at Appalachian Summit. You and I live here with our families in the Rocky Mountain Redoubt. There’s the Appalachian Redoubt and the Rocky Mountain Redoubt, and there are some rural places in Texas and the hill country and upstate New York. This is like enclaves and refuges of rural America that people are going to (0:15:54.3). What are your thoughts on being here in the Rocky Mountain Redoubt?

BS: It’s a vast improvement to when I was living on the East Coast.

SR: You were in Pittsburgh, right?

BS: Not just in terms of population. It’s nice to be in a place with fewer people, those are less potential threats to deal with in a crisis. There’s also a change in attitude, here it’s one of being self-sustaining, self-reliant and independent. People are friendlier in these areas. Back East, all I saw were yuppies ready to zombify and eat each other (0:16:57.0). It feels really good to be away from that. I don’t think human beings were meant to live all packed together, they were meant to be out here and be rural.

SR: (0:17:17.2) Where we live, we’re on a well, we have wood heat, almost everyone has chickens, a lot of folks have a dairy cow, goats. It’s a world of difference in self-sustainability compared to most America.

BS: (0:17:44.6) Most people in this country, looking at their resources and skill-set, they’d be dead within 6 weeks or less.

SR: Let’s imagine when the dollar loses its reserve status, which is not if but when. What do you see happening?

BS: There will be considerable increase in overall prices. Most items we consume are imported, even food. All of that is bought in dollars. When you have a devaluation, you have to spend more dollars to get the same amount of goods. When you have the loss of reserve status in the dollar (0:18:45.4), you have a devaluation of the currency. I think immediately you’re looking at 200%, 300%, possibly 400% increases in the price of goods on the shelf. With the reality, consistently falling wages, 92-93 million people out of work, that’s gonna devastate this country. 

SR: That’s even if the government officials have the best of intentions. Let’s imagine they don’t have good intentions and they don’t quadruple the EBT buying power.

BS: They’ve already proven that they won’t do that. In most sectors of necessary goods, food, gas until recently, you had 20-30% increase in prices since the crisis began. The Social Security Administration has not raised the amount of money they give out in checks. They’ve stopped all increases. People are getting the same amount of money in social security, but the prices keep going up. They’re not trying to adapt to the inflationary environment at all, which means they’re not gonna do that with EBTs or anything else.

SR: (0:20:50.9) It’s clear by their intent, not having a food reserve, not increasing buying power of social security or EBT cards, they’re sliding us into 3rd world status, they’re leaving us very vulnerable to starvation, if this goes bad. That’s obvious. What about timelines? You wrote a series of articles predicting that it’s possible that something could happen this fall. Where are you at when it comes to your foresight?

BS: (0:21:26.7) In spring I wrote a series of articles One Last Look at the Real Economy Before It Implodes. I talked about 2014, how many indicators there were that a renewed collapse was about to occur. I said people should compare 2014 to 2007, right before the derivatives collapse. People should compare 2015 to 2008, when everything became obvious. Right now, we’re in the midst of that collapse scenario. Market volatility, all around the globe. This is the beginning, this is the trigger, we’re witnessing it right now. (0:23:02.0) You need to be prepared within the next 6 months, before the end of the year you need to be squared away.

SR: Because we could have a loss of world reserve status for the dollar at any time.

BS: At any point. Saudi Arabia could pull the plug on the petrodollar, starting taking Euros or the Chinese yuans. Right now, the IMF SDR conference is going on, they’ve tried to extend things to the middle of next year. Once they try to bring China into the SDR, which is their new global currency system, you’ll start to see that it’s obvious that the dollar is no longer the primary mechanism for trade in the world. In the mean time, you’re gonna have all sorts of events: stock markets plummeting, derivatives issues, debt issues. All kinds of things will be happening in the next 6-12 months. I think it’s gonna be total chaos. The mainstream isn’t gonna have any idea what’s going on. (0:24:33.4) The only people that will have any clue will be alternative analysts in the Liberty Movement. But our voice, it’s not big enough to get out there to everybody. When this comes down, most people will not be prepared. Those people will become a liability for you and your community.

SR: (0:24:57.5) A few years ago, we talked to people about finding the refuge they can get to. Preferably the Rocky Mountains or the Appalachian Mountains, somewhere away from large population centers, but even inside every state. Every state has better places to be than in the big city.

BS: (0:25:23.0) Seek out family that’s on board. Move on to neighbors and friends that are squared away or understand where you’re coming from and what the situation is. Move on to your church. Build community from there in the next 6 months.

SR: You have to move to a place that already has that, or is further along the way.

BS: If you can.

SR: Get out of the city.

BS: If you have family that lives out in the country. Set up some kind of situation with them. There’s a lot of so-called urban survivalists out there, I think they’re just on drugs. The city is going to be a nightmare. If you’re one guy and you’re only goal is to hide (0:26:37.3) maybe you can do it in the city, but you could do it better in the country. Unless you have a whole block of people or apartment buildings of people working together, I don’t see the urban situation as viable. I think people will be eating each other alive.

SR: (0:27:06.7) Like 28 days later.

BS: A lot of people have normalcy bias, you know, my neighbors are nice, I don’t think they’d do that, they wouldn’t hurt me. Be around people who have been starving, see how they act. I still have hope for human beings, but at this point, if there is a collapse, you’ll see a lot of people forego their moral codes just to survive. (0:28:00.9) I’m not going to do that, but how many people are like that?

SR: Very few. I think it’s important to realize. Look at Argentina. Look at Bosnia. You had predatory hungry people from the city going out and raiding farms and looking for food. You had strong men who set themselves up as the war lord, forced women into prostitution, just turning people into slaves.

BS: (0:28:44.2) Yeah. Then you had a corrupt and vicious government who could act with impunity, servicing violence on everyone, and there’s was nothing people could do. In Bosnia, the people who survived had community. They worked together, they set up a militia, they would defend their neighborhood or town.

SR: And took care of each other. Otherwise, you’re gonna have a private warlord or a government warlord.

BS: (0:29:35.5) Never assume like some of these hippies, that it can all be handled peacefully. No, don’t listen to that crap. If you’re not able to defend yourself, someone will come take advantage of you. That’s how the world works. You don’t have to be violent, a bad guy, but be ready to kick the crap out of the bad guy. Otherwise you’re done.

SR: (0:30:14.9) That goes back to the secret squirrel who’s going to hide, sit in the basement with their family and their dried food. All their doing that is storing it for the gang-bangers, MS-13 is gonna say thanks and shoot you in the head.

BS: A lot of these lone wolf or isolated family guys, they’re rallying cry is OpSec. No one will know. BS. You’d have to never leave your house. If they see you nice and plump from eating, they’re gonna know you have food. Second, looters can be very random, they might be systematic, eventually someone’s gonna find out you’re there. You need a community around you or you’re done. Never make assumptions in terms of survival.

SR: (0:31:27.5) Let’s say your OpSec fails, what’s your plan B?

BS: Exactly.

SR: Any closing comments?

BS: I would say watch the markets, especially for the next two months. I think you’ll see a lot of evidence that supports the warnings I’m giving now. Watch carefully. If you don’t believe me now, I guarantee you will in 2 months.

SR: We’ll post a selection of top articles you’ve done in the past to lay out the evidence in writing, to folks who aren’t initiated into the economy.

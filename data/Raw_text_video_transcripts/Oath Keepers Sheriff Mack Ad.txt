## Richard Mack

RM: I’m the former sheriff of Graham County, Arizona. If you’re in the military, and if you’re in law enforcement, especially if you’re a sheriff, you took an oath of office, to uphold and defend, preserve, protect and obey the U.S. Constitution. If we had law enforcement in America that were doing that, keeping their oath, to do just that, we would have our Constitutional Republic back tomorrow. That’s how powerful this movement is.

<p><strong>Adam Boyle:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Testimonial: I wish all of my fellow Patriotic Oath Keepers out there a wonderful Independence Day weekend.</p>
<p>Those who call themselves Oath Keepers know more than most in this country what the 4th of July truly represents.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The same as it was all those years ago in 1776, it takes brave souls to stand up and speak out against tyranny, when so many weak minded individuals will blindly back down and defend those who oppress us, and wish to take away our God given rights.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I ask that this weekend, we all reflect on the sacrifices our fore fathers made signing the Declaration of Independence, blazing the trail that allowed our nation to be free and to write our American Constitution. Reflect on all those that made the ultimate sacrifice to keep their Oath to the Constitution.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Our fight for freedom this day does not require bullets. It requires a different type of bravery. It requires us to have the bravery to stand up against waves of criticism and say:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“ENOUGH! My rights are given to me by God, and PROTECTED by the CONSTITUTION!”</p>
<p>“YOU CANNOT TAKE MY RIGHTS!”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If we can all stand up for our rights, and speak with one voice, than we should never have to fight the battles for freedom that our nations founders did.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Reflect this day on the bravery in 1776, and reflect on the bravery of those speaking out this day.</p>
<p>Happy Independence Day to all of my fellow Oath Keepers!</p>

<p>In America this 4th day of July in the year two thousand fifteen.</p>

You and the Presidency have promoted such that American aggression might ignite World War 3; resulting in the destruction of America and thereafter your replacement of America with your “New World Order” government. This premeditated destruction of America is “War against America” and is your “Treason Against America”. War is war whether a gun or the stroke of a pen legislating a threat to the sovereignty of the Republic of America or the resulting damage to or death there of. Those involved that employ such are waging war against that which they swore oath to defend and are traitors to the Republic and are treasonous against all that is America.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Constitution of the United States, Article 3, Section 3. Treason against the United States, shall consist only in the levying War against them, or in adhering to their Enemies, or giving them Aid or Comfort.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In every stage of these Oppressions, We have Petitioned for Redress in the most humble terms. Our repeated Petitions have been answered only by repeated injury and increased oppression. A government whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a tyrant, is unfit to be the government of a free people.</p>
<p>We the people of America by virtue of our collective power of sovereignty do hereby relieve all of Congress, all of Presidency, and all of Supreme Court of all power, control, and of any jurisdictions there of or there in, within our United States Federal Government; exempting Patriots. We the sovereign people do define you “Tyrant” and charge you with “Treason” and “Oppression” according to the founding laws as set forth in the “Constitution”, “Bill of Rights”, and “Declaration of Independence”.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We the people of America by our collective power of sovereignty do hereby instruct the States of the United States to employ the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and all United States County Sheriffs to arrest all elected and or appointed members of all branches of the federal government of the United States that have perpetrated tyrannical oppressions (Tyrants) and or treasonous acts against America, its people, or founding laws. Jail or retain “Tyrants” or “Treasonous” till such time as “Constitutional Law” and “Founding Justice” be again established and implemented by the States.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We the people of America by our collective power of sovereignty do hereby declare the United States at a “State of Revolutionary War”. Federal “Tyrants” and “Treasonous” are hereby ordered to surrender to the proper authorities as specified herein. Any refusal thereof shall be construed as “Levying War against America” and shall be met with the deadly force necessary to preserve our republic of the United States of America; authority herein granted to the people as their duty and right under founding law.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We therefore the people of the United States through our collective power of sovereignty do hereby declare and affirm that America belongs to its people. That the people shall be free of federal oppression and tyranny. That liberty and justice shall take precedence over federal self interest and treason. That to restore the peoples’ America of our founders it becomes necessary to declare that which divides and separates us. And for the support of this Declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of the divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes, and our sacred Honor.</p>

<p><strong>Donice N. Smith:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Testimonial: I entered the Active Duty Army in June 1974 as a combat medic. I was on my way to Vietnam for the “baby lift operation” but ended up in Korea where I spent 13 months. We Lived under Martial Law. I began to see how fortunate we were as a nation…and the older I got the more I felt the Oath that I had taken. I have served a total of 41 years of Combined Services….including National Guards in two States and Army Reserves. I have retired, knowing that the OATH is more important and more clear to me, now then ever before. My service taught me the importance of teamwork, that we are all an important part of the picture… and the importance to Respect all who give of themselves. We must Defend the Constitution at all costs.</p>

<p><strong>RJ:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Testimonial: I am a very strong believer in the Constitution, but yet it seems to me that nothing is being done about the politicians that are violating the Constitution. They seem to like using the word terrorist against the people that strongly believe in the Constitution. We the people need to stand up to these criminals that are in the White House and in Washington. I strongly believe that if we could get 5 million people to march in Washington this would definitely put a bug up their ass; and what we really need to do is get the word out to the younger generation and explain to them exactly what is going on. It seems to me that they have no knowledge of anything that goes on in Washington.</p>

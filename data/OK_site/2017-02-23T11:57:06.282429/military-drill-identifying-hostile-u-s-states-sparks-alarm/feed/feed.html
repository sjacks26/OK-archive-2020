<content:encoded>This is an extremely well done report. Thank you. I have been concerned since I first heard Mark Levin talk about a con-con. You are opening a “Pandora’s Box” and what you pull out may be nothing like what you wanted. So far the Constitution and Bill of Rights have worked better than what might have been reasonably expected by the writers. As long as we can keep a good Supreme Court we should be all right. However, the latest decisions don’t lend a lot of confidence.

<content:encoded>My daughter lives in Ocala Florida, she told us recently that our Grandsons school had been turned in to a military staging area. Jade Helm is not just in Texas, Utah and California.

<content:encoded>if they are stealing people off public streets than its allready time for a overthrow of this system <strong>[some phrases deleted by Elias Alias, editor]</strong> as well as congress if any corrupted leo or obama loyal military try to stop us and refuse to join us than they have to be regarded as traitors and <strong>[five words deleted by Elias Alias, editor]</strong>  tried for crimes against the constitution when the revolution ends and then new amendments to the constitution need to be added so this never happens again with the people in this country.
<p>–<br/>
<strong>[Editor’s Note: I’m sure you can understand the sensitive position Oath Keepers is in under today’s political climate. We cannot allow some things to be posted on our website. This is not a reflection on you or your assessment of the problem — it’s just to keep our organization’s website up online on the “free” Internet. Be well, Bro.<br/>
Salute!<br/>

<content:encoded>There is no way the military is training for Iran, Iraq or any other foreign land. That’s exactly why the military has it’s own bases, has it’s own towns, patches of ocean, etc to train in/on. The entire military even has it’s own OPFOR, (Opposing Force) to play the bad guys complete with foreign equipment and tactics. Why train on American soil while using civilians if they aren’t the actual intended “enemy”. This exercise makes no sense whatsoever.  
<p>““They’re going to set up cells of people and test how well they’re able to move around without getting too noticed in the community,” Chief Deputy Roy Boyd with the Victoria County Sheriff’s Office was quoted as saying by the paper. “They’re testing their abilities to basically blend in with the local environment and not stand out and blow their cover.” A former Army Intelligence officer was also quoted downplaying fears about the drill and suggesting that it was largely routine training.”</p>
<p>Supposedly sneaking around California, Utah, Arizona, New Mexico, Colorado,Nevada, Texas, Louisiana, and  Florida is not going to prepare any Special Forces for any foreign countries. Don’t forget that DHS bought over 1.6 Billion rounds.The Govt. is arming itself to the teeth, while systematically stripping away every Americans 2nd Amendment rights.I can smell a big fat lie like a fart in a car, and this stinks to high heaven…….</p>

<content:encoded>I am an active CA soldier and have been apart of several smaller missions such as this if you notice the areas marked as hostile have very similar terrain to northern Iraq and Iran.  During these training ops in order to train the headquarters section and soldiers throughout the entire operation the map and overlays must be representative, as close as possible, to a real life deployed operation.  As such we label areas on the map as green zones or hostile territory.  where would you rather the green berets TRAIN? Iran or f****** Texas get over yourselves
<p>–<br/>
<strong>[Editor’s Note: I think we would prefer that our damned military train on its damn military bases, 10-4? The military has NO business trucking around on U.S.soil. But, “train” for what? Who is the Enemy? Who is it? The public now sees through the so-called war on terror, and we know that it is a hoax. Wake up please. The JADE HELM 2015 training exercise is wildly outside lawful bounds. Get back onto the military bases where you’re supposed to be, and get off of Americans’ lands, communities, towns, and out of our lives. And you can tell your damn GB Bros that an honorably discharged US Marine and Vietnam Veteran told you this.<br/>
Thanks for reading,<br/>
Salute!<br/>

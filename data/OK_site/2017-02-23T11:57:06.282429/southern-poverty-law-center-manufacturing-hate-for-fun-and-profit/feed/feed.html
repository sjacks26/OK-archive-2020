<content:encoded>Islam is far more than a mere “religion.” It is a way of government, of society, of conforming to the orders of imams and others whose lust for power compels them to lord over all people. Islam basically means “submission.”
<p>I refuse to submit and via the Web and from what I hear locally among the populace not a single American is willing to submit.</p>
<p>Do a Web search and witness the large number of fellow Americans writing about the SPLC who expose that cabal for what they are… well, I well omit my opinion and allow you to come to your own conclusion.</p>

<content:encoded>Another point missed is that SPLC feed’s INTEL to FBI, it was SPLC that told FBI to go after WACO, in all cases where churches are not Pro-Israel, then SPLC demonizes those churches.<br/>
FBI INTEL on who to kill all comes from SPLC, in summary FBI is a client killer of SPLC (AIPAC).

<content:encoded>So I bet my new tattoo has put me on the “radioactive” list? Don’t want anyone to have to guess where I stand.

<content:encoded>It’s ironic that a group that claims to dedicate itself to fighting hate and hate groups is itself a hate-spewing hate group who demonizes anyone who’s critical of the government or any of their leftist policies. And they do so while making a load of money, courtesy of our government and the useful idiots in the private sector that actually swallow their tripe.

<content:encoded>The SPLC truly is its own hate group, because “A lying tongue hates its victims…” (Proverbs 26:28). They lie about Family Research Council, my brother’s American Renaissance, and of course Oath Keepers.

<content:encoded>I never payed attention to the SPLC prior last week I actually had reason to look at them and what concerns me is there seemingly white hatred. Not one Islamic terror group listed Muslim brother hood ect. 
<p>Am I wrong for being proud of my heritage or what this country supposedly stands for. You cannot pinpoint any single person based on looks religion ect. With every culture you have your extremes and normal. The fact the SPLC has gone out of there way to make me feel like I’m a bad person while catering to Muslim groups is far from ok. Why is it that the religious clash is such a big deal, past shows what will happen and what the goals are here the Middle East has high hatred for  America and it’s ways and not noticing this slow encrouchment to our ideals and beliefs is not posssible.</p>

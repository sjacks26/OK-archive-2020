<content:encoded>Big Al,
<p>Thanks for expressing in a few words what I’ve been saying and writing for almost 3 years now. The difference is you did it with fewer words which made it more effective. I teach at a med school and fall easily into “lecture mode”.  “Operation American Spring” organized by Col. Harry Riley in 2013 failed, I believe due to indolence, complacency and ignorance. Several elegant studies have shown that if only 3-5% of a country’s population will rise up against a corrupt government, change for the better will result. This occurred in Turkey twice  when about 35,000 citizens descended on Istanbul and demanded a change. They got it. As a State Director for OAS, about 85 people told me they were going to D.C. on May 16, 2013. I knew we were in trouble when no one would come forward for any of 7 volunteer coordinator positions. You may know that only 100-150 people showed up in D.C. on that May 16th. I think we need to imitate the people of Turkey and descend en mass on D.C., kick the Obamas out of OUR White House, dissolve a puppet, treasonous “Congress”, the Supreme Court, the alphabet agencies, eliminate our concerns about unlawful “Executive Orders”, Martial Law, the “Illuminati”, Agenda 30, the “Illuminati”, the “New World Order”, gun confiscation and the Bilderberg group. These world bankers’ dreams are becoming our worst nightmare, and on a global scale. I believe we could schedule new elections, pull together as ONE nation under God, set our petty differences (which really don’t make a difference) aside, and work to not only take back control of our Nation and our government, but to return to a republic based on out Constitution without the legalistic, semantic gimmicks that we have recently uncovered. Perhaps we will be less complacent in matters of politics and hold OUR public servants accountable. Foreign policy and domestic policy interact intimately. We have a lot of mending to do in both areas, but time is short. As a long-time friend from active duty days, a Lt. Col. in intel told me only a few week ago, “I can’t say much, but I will tell you that the fuse is very short”. Let’s get organized, pull together, cooperate and take the hill.</p>
<p>Yours in LIberty</p>

<content:encoded>The U.N.’s Agenda 21, civil war and the like can be eliminated if only the people became informed about the reality, that doing away with the illegitimate governmental agencies would take care of many of our problems.

<content:encoded>It amazes me how many people complain about these rules,policies,procedures.ect… They are not laws!!! Your God given right to self preservation allows you to create a fire to protect yourself from the cold! No different from your God given right to defend your life with whatever means necessary.  Do not respond! Do not follow unconstitutional ungodly rules,policies,procedures,expectations. PERIOD!

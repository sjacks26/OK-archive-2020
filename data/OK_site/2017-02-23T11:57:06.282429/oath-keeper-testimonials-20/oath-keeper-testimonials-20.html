<p><strong>Gregg O’Neill:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Testimonial: Hi, this is Greg O’Neill, I served with honor for nine years of active duty, with a hitch in the Navy (70-74), serving in the Tonkin Gulf, building bombs on the attack aircraft carrier, KITTY HAWK (CVA-63), and later in the Army (79-83) after a drunken bosun’s mate chief recruiter took off on leave, putting my record jacket in his locked drawer, which caused me to miss my window of opportunity to get back in the Navy, so I joined the Army. Back in 70 – 74 they did not have PTSD diagnosed, so we faced being pariahs when we went home from the “War” as they call it now. I dealt with guilt for building bombs to kill innocent folk in Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos, when we were ordered to be silent about what we were doing, in violation of international agreements, bombing countries we didn’t declare war on, including Vietnam, North and South.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I am not ashamed of taking the oath to serve our country, to defend our constitution against enemies, foreign and domestic, but now I’m disgusted to see those enemies in DC, and in the Pentagon, who serve corporate interests over the needs of our country, and states, they have forgotten who they are serving. Our young people are in Iraq and Afghanistan, not to defend our nation, but to serve the OIL industry, and the drug runners making money from their growing poppies in Afghanistan, and making heroin from selling it to junkies here in the States. There is a company in England now making synthetic fuels, identical to those refined from crude oil, extracting hydrogen and carbon from the air to make hydrocarbons, why aren’t we using that instead of serving Big OIL?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When I attended OCS Class 1-80 at Fort Benning we were told to watch the  senior officers coming out of command classes at Infantry Hall, for them to serve as our role models, what a bunch of slackers, out of shape duffel bags, fat boys, promoted with over inflated efficiency reports from their brown nosing commanding officers. How many of them have made money from the corporations in the military industrial complex that make weapons systems, and supplies, for our armed forces?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We know what the problems are, now what do we do about it? I, and my friends, have access to advanced technologies to provide every state with abundant clean energy, food and water, we are up against a wall put there by those who would rather kill us than to see these technologies used to put our country back to work, and on our feet again to stand tall, and proud of our nation, self-reliant, and independent as we once were.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I’d love to see other vets and active duty personnel ending the “wars” in other countries, and getting to work here to turn our country around, and put back on track to being a country governed by our constitutional law, free of tyranny from DC, and the corrupt feds. Tell the slackers at the Pentagon to do what is right, and to do what they know needs doing NOW.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Testimonial: Anyone of moral character would want Stewart Rhodes to be their team mate. He is a passionate team player and leader. He led a field event in Oregon several years ago which I was able to video tape. I have videoed other events he has done here. He is an inspiration through his behavior. The character trait I enjoy most is his forthrightness. When something is happening the whole team is kept aware. Our biggest challenge as a team is to develop in each of our communities an appreciation for who Oath Keepers really is instead of who the old media say we are. I ignore the accusations, I just keep reaching, teaching and inspiring others.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">————————————————————————————————————————————</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Judy Sue Christenson:</strong></p>
<p>Testimonial: To Stewart Rhodes and all who stand for Liberty:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I wish to express my husband’s and my deepest respect and profound gratitude for all you are doing and have done. We are all one in the Spirit of the 56 who signed the Declaration of Independence, the greatest Master Mind in history. Your courage and others’ is inspiring a nation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">May each of us be guided by God. I have been keeping a virtually perpetual prayer vigil for several years that increased in intensity prior to the Bundy situation 2014. One such time was the day before and exactly during that intense confrontation day. Archangel Michael is the patron saint of all who work to protect and defend Liberty and he has stepped through the veil to save many lives including World War I and World War II. I will continue a fiery vigil until the Hammond/Bundy situation is resolved by God’s grace with no harm to life and we restore Liberty in America and the planet. We pray that much is mitigated in the current situation and I know many are praying and acting as guided.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">God is in charge and I believe we are in the midst of George Washington’s third vision. I also believe and hope that victory is nigh in the not far distant future, and the fire of freedom and Liberty is greatly accelerating in America in these critical times. Prophecy is given so that it can be mitigated or averted by actions and prayers.</p>
<p>George Washington’s Third Vision:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“And, I dimly saw these vast armies devastate the whole country and burn the villages, towns and cities that I beheld springing up…..’Son of the Republic, look and learn.’ When the voice had ceased, the dark shadowy angel placed his trumpet once more to his mouth, and blew a long and fearful blast.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“’Instantly a light as of a thousand suns shone down from above me, and pierced and broke into fragments the dark cloud which enveloped America. At the same moment the angel upon whose head still shone the word Union, and who bore our national flag in one hand and a sword in the other, descended from the heavens attended by legions of white spirits. These joined the inhabitants of America, who I perceived were well-nigh overcome, but who immediately taking courage again, closed up their broken ranks and renewed the battle……</p>
<p>“’Instantly the dark cloud rolled back, together with the armies it had brought, leaving the inhabitants of the land victorious…</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“’…the bright angel, planting the azure standard he had brought in the midst of them, cried with a loud voice: “While the stars remain, and the heavens send down dew upon the earth, so long shall the Union last.” And taking from his brow thecrown on which blazoned the word ‘Union,’ he placed it upon the Standard, while the<br/>
people, kneeling down, said, ‘Amen.'”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I will sign off with The American’s Creed by William Tyler Page:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“I believe in the United States of America as a government of the people, by the people, for the people, whose just powers are derived from the consent of the governed; a democracy in a Republic; a sovereign Nation of many sovereign States; a perfect Union, one and inseparable; established upon those principles of freedom, equality, justice and humanity for which American patriots sacrificed their lives and fortunes.</p>
<p>“I therefore believe it is my duty to my Country to love it; to support its Constitution; to obey its laws; to respect its flag; and to defend it against all enemies.”</p>
<p>I would add to only support laws in alignment with the Constitution and God’s natural laws.<br/>
May God Bless our endeavors.<br/>
With deep respect,<br/>
Judy Sue Christenson</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>BW:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Testimonial: I am a father of 2, Veteran. I have been looking into the Oath Keepers for a year now and am excited about taking the first step in joining this incredible team of patriots. I am honored to call myself a member of the team and, I pledge to aid in whatever I can to advance the cause. Shout out to my friend and patriot brother T. Engel.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">————————————————————————————————————————————————————-</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Tom McMillan:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Testimonial: I just got off the phone with a friend who is a member of the Jackson County Community Preparedness Team, here in the Smoky Mountains of Western North Carolina. I’m a Associate Member of Oath Keepers and also a member of JCCPT. The topic of Civil War came up so I proceeded to tell the story of my family the McMillan’s, it goes like this.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Back in the 1970’s me and my father, John B. McMillan, were reading Mother Earth News and saw the section about, The Economic Outlook. So off to back to the land world we went. We bought a beautiful 30 acre farm that was in the family at one time in Barrow, County, Georgia. After several years of bringing the old home place back upscale we had a wonderful place. It was a old dairy farm with lots of outbuilding, Lakes, pastures and woodlots.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So, to keep a long story short, this standoff in Oregon has some of us remembering the damage done to families when confronted with the task of standing up for our rights as Americans. My father said, per Art. 1, Sec. 10, of the US Constitution, that the only thing that’s legal tender is gold and silver coin. So, all his debts were null and void. That brought the Law Enforcement to the door… and this was Sept. 30th, 1982, his birthday. A SWAT team from Athens Georgia came on the farm and shot him 18 times for Terrorist Threats. They blocked off all the roads in the area and I was the first one of the family to arrive on the scene since it was his birthday. I had worked with him in Automotive Sales Promotion for 14 years in Atlanta, Georgia, where he was well known for being on TV for Central Chevrolet in the sixties.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So, we got Bobby Lee Cook to represent us in a Civil Rights Violation…since it’s Martin Luther King day civil stories work. The wrongful death, excessive force charges went on for several years until we settled out of court with a Gag Rule on the case…I can’t find any information on it. So, they talked about it on the Phil Donahue show in relation to Gordan Kahl who was a tax protester out west and took out some US Marshalls and the Sheriff.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So now at 64, disabled but still upright I’m wondering if this Oregon action is effecting other people of the US Patriot Community. Now I’m looking for a battle rifle, AR, some camo and some people to hang out with. Both my grown children who lived on the farm are disabled now. I hope the checks keep coming…but don’t let them say disabled people are exempt of the 2nd Amendment.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Blessings, Tom McMillan , Whittier, NC</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Jerry Bowman:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Testimonial: I am a veteran. I fought for the freedom of people I did not know and whose language I do not speak for 2 years. Do you think for one minute I would give up my freedom? Not bloody likely!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">————————————————————————————————————————————————–</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Kyle Jennings:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Testimonial: Born and raised in Dallas, Texas. Joined the military at 18 did basic at Fort Sill Oklahoma; nearly froze to death, then went on to Fort Hood. Served under 3 star Gen. Ulmer in the first and seventy seventh cavalry in field artillery on the 109 howitzer got lucky and got teamed up with best group of green privates anywhere. We quickly became number 1 gun in world history and received 2 letters of accommodation in our files from General Ulmer for putting more rounds on time and on target than had ever been done.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Before I took my life-time oath I pledged allegiance to the flag of the United States of America.I had an uncle die in WW2 I never got to meet and 3 older cousins that made it home from Vietnam thank God. So when I swore to protect and serve my American brothers and sisters I meant for life .I never thought I would see the greatest nation on earth become the most hated and evil murdering bunch of Satanic homosexual and pedophiles running our government and I can document everything I say. I never lie to anyone. There are two things they can’t take away from us: one is your education, if you were fortunate enough to get to college, and next, and most important, is your word! I gave my word, and I’m giving it again, to give my life if necessary, defending those that aren’t capable, and taking my honorable country back from the criminals that have disgraced all the soldiers that made this country great may Almighty God be with us when the battle starts. This is the last time</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I will say this as well.”BARACK OBAMA I DEMAND THAT YOU IMMEDIATELY CEASE AND DESIST AND TURN YOURSELF IN FOR TREASON AS WELL AS CONSPIRACY. WHEN YOU ORDERED THE 2 UNDER COVER FBI(FUMBLING BUNCH of IDIOTS)AGENTS TO DRESS AS MILITIA MEMBERS IN OREGON AND TERRORIZE THE CITIZENS AS WELL AS THE NUMEROUS OTHER CRIMES YOU HAVE COMMITTED. IF YOU DO NOT, THEN WHEN THIS STARTS AND YOU DECLARE WAR, THAT’S WHEN I DECLARE WAR ON YOU AND I WILL COME AND ARREST YOU PERSONALLY</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">—————————————————————————————————————————————-</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Anonymous:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Testimonial: I have taken the oath on three occasions and seen 19 different countries. The second time I took the oath, I reflected upon it as very just. The third time I took oath, I was mentally prepared and strong in the convictions of the oath. I look at our Constitution as solid as granite and a standard to act upon in reverent caution.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The reason for seeing these other countries was to help correct other countries that abused their citizens or that of other countries. We have many dead soldiers buried abroad that fought for the freedoms in our constitution we hold dear.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There are no dead foreign soldiers buried in the US from other countries that was here to free our citizens.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I remember the days of John F Kennedy running for president quoting, “Ask not what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for your country.” The actions of government with its people is in complete opposite today. President Kennedy views would be a far right extremist today.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I have no problem defending the Constitution, especially when I see gross abuse of other people and positions of office that have taken the same oath.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Constitution is my rock.</p>

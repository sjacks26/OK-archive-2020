<content:encoded>I do not wish that the Oath Keepers exist. I am glad they do.
<p>My parents lived through WWII Europe under the thumb of the Nazis. As a result, I was raised to absolutely mistrust government and have become proficient in firearms and tactical computer use (less awesomely referred to as Internet Social Media or just Public Relations).</p>
<p>The Nazis came to power through thug oppression tactics combined with a conspiracy with Europe’s wealthy allowing the corporations to do anything they wanted.  Dissenters jailed or murdered. Whole communities ‘relocated’ (gassed and burned) After consolidating power the Nazis banned private weapons ownership (the rich and government still had guns) and then rounded up and murdered perceived enemies in the millions.</p>
<p>Understand that my family was not an oppressed minority. Grandfather was a Colonel in the  Sturmabteilung (SA; or Assault Division) and for a short period a personal bodyguard and driver of Ernst Rohm. My father was Waffen Schutzstaffel (Combat SS). They saw the evil from within. I am seeing it here, now.They managed to get out. We are still in it.</p>
<p>I wonder who is paying the Bureau of Land Management steal Sugar Pine for them?</p>
<p>Because the Supreme Court decision (or psychoses or bribery – pick one)  declared corporations to be people, the wealthy now buy elections with full impunity and have become de facto royalty and can rule by decree. Law no longer exists for them. Rights no longer exist for us. Unless they are reclaimed. </p>
<p>This is not a call to violence. It’s a call to assert rights and restore common decency. The current situation reminds me of Wounded Knee in the 1970s When the Lakota decided to no longer be prisoners in a concentration camp. Sugar Pine Mine is not nearly at the level of Wounded Knee, but it does share elements. The government (well, the wealthy puppeteers) have gone beyond localized subjugation of a small ethnic minority to a national program powerful enough to slowly enslave everyone. Best defence is an overwhelming capacity for offence, not it’s use.</p>
<p>The Oath Keepers, to be critical, need a more diverse membership. At first glance the organization does look like another bunch of Koch Brothers funded right wing Tea Party kooks working toward an all out race war based solely on ignorance and warped versions of the Bible. A few women on armed peacekeeping patrol would not hurt either.</p>
<p>If we do not support struggling miners in Oregon, black people in Ferguson, equal rights for gays, quash government abuse anywhere, anytime,  then the masters will be emboldened to control us all.</p>

<content:encoded>I am retired and giving serious consideration to driving to Oregon to volunteer for anything that will be helpful.  I am 66 years old, but I have excellent health and willing to do whatever is asked of me.
<p>I did a walk across America in “Support of the U.S. Constitution” with a homeless veteran.  We walked from San Diego to D.C.  Our website shows dozens of TV/Newspaper interviews  ( <a href="http://www.WalkDaddyWalk.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.WalkDaddyWalk.com</a> ).</p>
<p>Do let me know who I can contact to answer a few questions that I have…Warm regards…</p>

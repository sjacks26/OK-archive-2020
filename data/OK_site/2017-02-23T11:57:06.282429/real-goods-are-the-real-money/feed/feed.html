<content:encoded>Another (potential) source is to drive a ‘Sand Point’ (pointed pipe in three-foot sections that you “beat” (any way you have) as deep as you must to hit water.  Rocky states don’t work so well with sand points, but they sure will in Florida (anywhere there is or used to be Mississippi ‘silt’ or that Red Georgia Clay)!

<content:encoded>I avoid a paper trail by just driving to whomever has the product in the amount I want and “truck it home” myself …once home nobody can see what comes off the truck as we have no neighbors close enough see us …let alone watch us unload a 24footer.  lol….  Speaking of propane tis far better to bury a couple (or just one) of the bigger tanks (like 260 gallons or 500 gallons) to feed a propane (Samsung) stove/oven/convection plus a Generac “something” (a bit over 8kW) ….dunno how much 2 years would cost but I’m sure it would HURT! <img alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" src="https://www.oathkeepers.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;"/>

<content:encoded>Clean water can be had as easily as setting up an above ground swimming pool with a cover and maintaining it.

<content:encoded>Buy from a local source or gun show, or, if you have the money you can buy a freeze drying machine for around $4000.  You could charge people to use it to make some of your money back.

<content:encoded>@ Charlie Brown… try to find a mom &amp; pop survival based business. Go in and tell them you want this or that and the quantity and it will be a cash purchase. The name you are using on this site will suffice. I do it a lot and it works.

<content:encoded>How much is two yrs. worth of propane? Also I have prepped for years and am about out. I have wanted to purchase 25 yr. shelf life buckets, so I won’t have to keep buying and rotating. My question is how can you get $10,000 worth of freeze dried food shipped to your home without alerting the Guber’s. And about weapons have all of the above, but need a few anti-tank and helo shoulder fires, and a 30 or 50 cal. browning belt gun. No, but seriously I am trying to get around paper trail with freeze dry foods, any ideas?

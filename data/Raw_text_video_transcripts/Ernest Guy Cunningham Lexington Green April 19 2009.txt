## Video starts with SR introducing Guy Cunningham. GC speaks very animatedly. He’s almost preaching.

SR: Now we’re gonna hear from a former Navy Lt. Commander Guy Cunningham, a demonstration of a military man who kept his oath.

GC: I thank God that I was born an American, when I was born in 1953. I thank God that I was born into a family of Christian parents who raised me walking, not just talking, as Christians. I thank God that I received a Christian education, that the public education system at that time was based on Christianity. I thank God that I was motivated, that when I was growing up I studied the Magna Carta – I said studied, not just read – that by graduation from the 6th grade, I could quote over 100 scriptures from the Bible. I thank God that I studied the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution, that I was well-versed in it by the 10th grade (0:01:27.4). I thank God that I felt a yearning to volunteer to serve my Constitution and my country when called upon in 1972. Because of my Christian raising, because of my studies, that when I took my oath to uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies foreign and domestic, I knew in my heart what I meant when I raised my hand and swore to it. (0:01:59.5)

GC: I thank God that he blessed me with being able to become an Army Green Beret, whose motto is freedom of the oppressed. I thank God that he blessed me to become a Navy pilot, and that he blessed me that I was selected to go to the Naval Postgraduate School, where, because of what was going on, I was motivated and blessed to write my thesis on peacekeeping and UN operational control, a study of their effect on unit cohesion, and the combat arms survey at 29 Palms, where basically 2 questions I asked because of a fear in my heart that in 1994, as I was taking a snapshot of US Marines concerning operations other than war called peacekeeping. And because our POTUS, less than 60 days after he took his first term inauguration swearing of his oath, William Jefferson Clinton so there’s no doubt in your mind, printed on March 11, 1993, USA Today page 2, and I quote, we cannot be so fixated on our desire to preserve (0:03:46.7) the rights of ordinary Americans to legitimately own handguns and rifles that we can’t think about reality. Excuse me, but that SC judge who issued that oath of office to him should have stood up and called for his impeachment. (0:04:06.7)

GC: In the fall of 1993, with an article written by Pat Buchanan in the Conservative Chronicle, he wrote about Clinton’s coming to enact presidential decision directive 13, which later did become enacted in May 1994 as presidential decision directive 25, which gave POTUS as commander-in-chief the authority to place – listen real closely now – to place the servitude of Armed Forces personnel under the auspices, the command and control of the United Nations

## Note: this language that we’re supposed to “listen real closely” to isn’t present in PDD-25, which is about this subject

Crowd boos, interrupting him (0:05:02.7)

GC: And specifically under the operational field control and command of UN appointed foreign officers and NCOs.

Crowd boos again. Someone says treason

GC: Also in fall 1993, was the drafting of the Clintons’ Assault Weapons Ban which was enacted in May 1994.

Crowd boos again. Multiple people say treason

GC: (0:05:41.7) 15 years later, now folks are learning what was really behind Guy Cunningham and he was not a Clinton plant. He was not someone you could not trust. He was truly an oath keeper. (0:06:06.1)

GC: I wrote that thesis on unit cohesion and I wanted to find out just what was the attitude of those Marines. I’ll boil it down to 2 questions. When I swore in, I memorized Article 1 of the Code of Conduct, the Eisenhower version, which read – and not today reads, I took the gender-specific form, it’s gender-neutral now – I am an American fighting man (0:06:47.2). I serve in the forces which guard my country and our way of life. I am prepared to give my life in their defense. (0:06:56.7)

Crowd cheers, interrupting him

GC: In preparing the survey, I changed that a little bit, because the Marines were being used in Somalia, and operations other than war, or peacekeeping. I asked the Marines to state, I will swear to the following Code: I am a United Nations fighting person. I serve in the forces which maintain world peace.

An individual boos briefly (0:07:42.6)

GC: And every nation’s way of life. I am prepared to give my life in their defense.

A few people boo and shout no!

GC: Presidential decision directive 25, if exercised, very clearly subverted the soldier’s oath of office to the Constitution because it caused that individual to give servitude to the United Nations Charter and the UN itself (0:08:12.8)

Lots of booing, an individual says treason

GC: 23.66% of 300 male combat-trained Marines at 29 Palms, the home of the US Marine Corps Air Ground Combat Training Center said Yes they would swear to that code (0:08:38.8)

Lots of booing

GC: 23.66%, and again I remind you that the theme of my thesis was unit cohesion. Now you’ve got more than a quarter of the folks in that unit who would swear to that code.

Someone says more of us than there are them. Someone else says lets get them.

GC: The last question that got so much attention. I set up the scenario because of the AWB and what President Clinton said on March 11, I set up the following scenario. The government has banned the possession, the sale, the transfer, and transportation of all non-sporting firearms. I used that term because Josh Sugarman who had created the assault weapons, President Clinton said it’s okay to be a hunter and use hunting weapons. But I use non-sporting firearms. So the government has banned all that, and a 30 day amnesty period (0:09:53.3) has provided for citizens to turn these firearms over to local authorities. At the end of this amnesty period, several citizen groups form to refuse to turn their firearms over. Consider the following. I would fire on US citizens who refuse or resist the confiscation of firearms ban by the US government. 

Several people shout hell no (0:10:18.4)

GC: 26.34%, with 11% saying they had no opinion, said yes they would.

People boo. Someone says wrong.

GC: Ladies and gentlemen, I proved my hypothesis with this snapshot (0:10:42.6) concerning unit cohesion and using the Marines, which everyone knows Semper Fi

Several people say Hoorah

GC: Who are there, who really have historically lived out their oaths to (0:11:02.7) uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States.

## Sounds like GC’s voice is breaking here

GC: Then and now, I was not only sad, I was mad. And today I’m declaring that I’m amad. This stands for me personally: A M A D. American Militia Against Despotism. Thank you for your time. (0:11:38.5)

SR: His survey is evidence of why we need OK, why we need this organization to spread the word, to make sure that when he goes back and does another survey, he finds out that 100% of them say hell no.

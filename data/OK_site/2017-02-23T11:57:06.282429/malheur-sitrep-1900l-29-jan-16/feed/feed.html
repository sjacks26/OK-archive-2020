<content:encoded>Good words, and understandable Elias. Some choose to not understand. Myself, I thought they approached this, ( at the refuge ), all wrong. But an honorable man lies dead, and a family greives. And the PTB continue on this path of destruction. The result was murder no less, but, average citizen, will buy the big lie. Because, its easier. Kudos to you, prayers for our country. I would much rather attack a burning structure fire, with a &lt; than 50% survivable outcome. Than approach the fire that at present, is consuming our whole way of life. Salute

<content:encoded>WGP, pretty obvious the feds waited for them to get away from everybody to take them down ? That should be beyond clear. So the hundreds in this particular scenario would not have done anything except perhaps made it worse. Another set of circumstances and may yes ? Each event is on its own merits and or demerits as the case may be.

<content:encoded>Sit rep update, the FBI arrested Bundy.  The militia proved useless and completely outgunned and out played.

<content:encoded>hard to tell much when the darn thing keep blurring going around trees panning in panning out. a couple of times I see someone lean down, or bend over him , but then the camera zooms in somewhere else each time so….<br/>
I know this though and it may have been said already. I see at least one maybe two of what looks like bullet holes in the front windshield, which would indicate they were shooting as he tried to run the road block. I see what looks like a hole on top of the roof near the drivers side as well, but I seen that at the first stop too as well so…<br/>
I do have this though I’ve finally been green lighted by my wife to go if I have to when the next thing comes. Now just got to shore up my funding issue, If there’s any kind of action later on and depends on how far too, but will try.

<content:encoded>Lavoy died because they want his ranch in AZ. He wasn’t an accidental shooting, he was targeted. Watch the video, assination 101 – Some body was given the order just like Ruby Ridge.  <a href="http://www.ploughforsheriff.com/robertlavoyfinicum/" rel="nofollow">http://www.ploughforsheriff.com/robertlavoyfinicum/</a>

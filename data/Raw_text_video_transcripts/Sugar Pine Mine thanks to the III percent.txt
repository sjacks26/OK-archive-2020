Caption: Oath Keepers Josephine County Sugar Pine Mine Thanks to III Percent! April 26, 2015

JR: I’m the county coordinator for Josephine County OK. With me are the III Percenters. We are thanking them for their support here at the Sugar Pine Mine. They’ve been with us for 2 weeks, and their time has come for them to go home to their families. We are deeply appreciative of their support, what they’ve done here, and how they’ve been so foundational on this organization. We’ve been able to build inroads, new friendships, and relationships with this group. Our unity in working together has changed the face of Americans standing up for the Constitution. I truly am thankful for their support.

## Everyone says thanks

JR: I offer them safe travel home back to their families. And I look for more people like these disciplined professionals to come out here and support us at the Sugar Pine Mine in the miners’ fight against the BLM to support their 5A due process and their constitutional right to that.

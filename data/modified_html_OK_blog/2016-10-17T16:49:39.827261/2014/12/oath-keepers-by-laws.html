<strong>BYLAWS OF OATH KEEPERS</strong></h1>
<strong>ARTICLE I</strong><br/>
<strong>DEFINITIONS</strong><br/>
<strong>Section 1.01. “Articles” </strong>The Articles of 
Incorporation of the Foundation filed with the Secretary of State of 
Nevada on the Effective Date. (Document No. 20090801288-48), as amended.<br/>
<strong>Section 1.02. “Board” </strong>shall mean the group of all Trustees, as constituted from time to time.<br/>
<strong>Section 1.03. “Bylaws” </strong>shall mean these bylaws, as amended.<br/>
<strong>Section 1.04. “Effective Date” </strong>shall mean October 22, 2009, the date on which the Articles were filed.<br/>
<strong>Section 1.05. “Founder” </strong>shall mean E. Stewart Rhodes<br/>
<strong>Section 1.06. “Oath Keepers” </strong>shall mean and refer to
 the Oath Keepers, a Nevada nonprofit corporation, organized by virtue 
of the filing of the Articles on the Effective Date, for the purposes 
therein stated.<br/>
<strong>Section 1.07. “Trustee” </strong>shall mean and refer to the 
Founder each individual elected to serve on the Board pursuant to 
Section 2.01 of these Bylaws. Each Trustee must be a natural person.<br/>
<strong>ARTICLE II</strong><br/>
<strong>TRUSTEES</strong><br/>
<strong>Section 2.01. Number, Tenure and Qualifications. </strong>The
 Board of Oath Keepers shall consist of the Founder and at least ten 
(10) additional Trustees. For so long as the Founder is living, is not 
incompetent and has not resigned, the Founder shall be absolutely 
entitled to serve as a Trustee of Oath Keepers and Chairman of the 
Board. The Board shall be self-perpetuating electing their own 
replacements, and the terms of office of the Trustees shall be 
staggered. Upon the expiration of the term of office of a Trustee, 
subject to the provisions of Section 2.12, the remaining Trustees whose 
terms of office are not expiring, by majority vote shall elect an 
individual to serve as a Trustee to replace any Trustee whose term is 
expiring. Other than the Founder, the term of office of each Trustee 
shall be thirty-six months or approximately thirty-six months commencing
 on the date on which such Trustee accepts appointment and ending on the
 date of the annual meeting of Trustees during the third calendar year 
following the year in which such Trustee’s term of office commenced. No 
more than one-third of the Trustees (plus one if the total number of 
Trustees is not divisible by three) may be elected in any year.<br/>
<strong>Section 2.02. Resignation. </strong>Any Trustee may resign 
effective upon giving written notice to the chairman of the Board unless
 the notice specifies a later time for effectiveness of such 
resignation. If the Board accepts the resignation of a Trustee tendered 
to take effect at a future date, the Board may elect a successor to take
 office when the resignation becomes effective.<br/>
<strong>Section 2.03. Removal.</strong><br/>

(a) The Board, by majority vote, may declare vacant the office of a 
Trustee who has been declared incompetent by an order of court of 
competent jurisdiction or who has been convicted of a felony.<br/>

(b) That any one or more Trustees, other than the Founder, Trustee 
may be removed from office without cause for any reason or no reason, by
 the vote of the Founder and at least two-thirds of the remaining 
members of the Board.<br/>
<strong>Section 2.04. Vacancies. </strong>Subject to the provisions 
of Section 2.12, a vacancy in the Board because of death, resignation, 
removal or otherwise, may be filled by the remaining Trustees by the 
affirmative vote of a majority thereof, although less than a quorum. 
Each successor so elected shall hold office for the unexpired portion of
 the term of office of the Trustee whose office became vacant or until a
 successor shall have otherwise been duly elected and qualified.<br/>
<strong>Section 2.05. Annual Meeting. </strong>The annual meeting of 
the Board shall be held without any notice other than this provision at 
10:00 o’clock a.m. on the day preceding the first day of the annual 
conference in October of each year, for the purpose of electing Trustees
 and for the transaction of such other business as may properly come 
before the meeting. If the election of Trustees is not held on the day 
designated herein for any annual meeting of the Board, or at any 
adjournment thereof, the president of Oath Keepers shall cause the 
election of Trustees to be conducted at a special meeting of the Board 
as soon thereafter as may be convenient.<br/>
<strong>Section 2.06. Regular Meetings. </strong>Regular monthly 
meetings of the Board shall be held, without any notice other than this 
provision on the first Wednesday of each month; but if such day is a 
legally-recognized holiday then the meeting otherwise scheduled to be 
held on such day shall be rescheduled and held on any day which occurs 
within the period which begins on the first Wednesday of such month and 
ends on the last day of such month. Nothing contained in this Section 
2.06, however, shall be construed to preclude the holding of a special 
meeting in lieu of any cancelled regular meeting.<br/>
<strong>Section 2.07. Special Meetings. </strong>Special meetings of 
the Board may be called by the chairman and shall be called by the 
chairman of the Board upon the request of any two Trustees.<br/>
<strong>Section 2.08. Place of Meetings. </strong>Any meeting of the 
Board may be held at its registered office or at such other place as the
 Chairman may designate. A waiver of notice signed by all of the 
Trustees may designate any place for the holding of such meeting.<br/>
<strong>Section 2.09. Notice of Meetings.</strong><br/>

(a) Except as otherwise provided in Section 3.06, the secretary of 
Oath Keepers shall cause to be delivered to all Trustees written notice 
of any special meeting of the Board at least twenty-four hours before 
the date and time of such meeting.<br/>

(b) Any proper business may be presented at any meeting of the Board,
 regardless of whether or not the nature of such business is stated in 
the notice or waiver of notice.<br/>

(c) Any notice or demand required or desired to be given to any party
 pursuant to these Bylaws shall be in writing and shall be validly 
served, given, delivered or made only if (i) personally delivered 
(including delivery by a commercially-recognized courier which provides 
service between the point-of-origin and the point-of-destination); (ii) 
deposited in the United States mail, certified or registered, postage 
prepaid, return receipt requested; or (iii) made by telecopied 
transmission or electronic transmission. Service by United States mail 
shall be deemed made on the date actually received or the date on which 
delivery is first attempted, whichever is sooner. Service by telecopier 
shall be deemed made upon the date of transmission provided transmission
 is confirmed prior to 5:00 o’clock p.m. local time at the place of 
delivery on a business day or, if the date of transmission is not a 
business day (i.e. Saturday, Sunday or legally-recognized holiday at the
 place of delivery) or if transmission is confirmed after 5:00 o’clock 
p.m. local time at the place of delivery on a business day, service 
shall be deemed made on the first business day after the date of 
transmission.<br/>

(d) The written certificate of the person delivering notice of any 
meeting of the Board, setting forth the substance of the notice, the 
dates the notice was mailed, delivered or telecopied, and the addresses,
 telecopier number, or electronic address to which the notice was 
mailed, delivered, telecopied, or electronically transmitted, shall be <em>prima facie </em>evidence of the manner and fact of giving such notice.<br/>
<strong>Section 2.10. Waiver of Notice.</strong><br/>

(a) Any Trustee may waive notice of a meeting by written instrument, 
signed by such Trustee, either before or after such meeting. Such waiver
 shall have the same effect as if notice were properly given to such 
Trustee.<br/>

(b) Attendance of a Trustee at a meeting shall constitute a waiver of
 notice of such meeting, unless such attendance is for the express 
purpose of objecting to the transaction of business there at because the
 meeting is not properly called, noticed, or convened.<br/>
<strong>Section 2.11. Quorum; Adjourned Meetings.</strong><br/>

(a) A majority of Trustees in office shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business by the Board at any meeting.<br/>

(b) At any meeting of the Board where a quorum is not present, a 
majority of those Trustees present may adjourn, from time to time, until
 a quorum is present, and no notice of such adjournment shall be 
required. At any adjourned meeting where a quorum is present, any 
business may be transacted which could have been transacted at the 
meeting originally called.<br/>
<strong>Section 2.12. Board Decisions. </strong>The affirmative vote 
of a majority of the Trustees present at a meeting at which a quorum is 
present shall be the action of the Board. Provided however, the Founder 
shall have the power of veto which may be overridden only by the vote of
 two thirds of those Trustees present. Provided further however, any 
decision which may benefit a Trustee or affiliates of a Trustee, 
directly or indirectly, pecuniarily, economically or otherwise, shall be
 determined by the affirmative vote of a majority of disinterested 
Trustees, even if the number of disinterested Trustees is less than a 
majority of the Trustees.<br/>
<strong>Section 2.13. Order of Business. </strong>The order of business at any meeting of the Board, insofar as may be reasonably practical, shall be as follows:<br/>

(a) Call to order.<br/>

(b) Determination of directors present and existence of quorum.<br/>

(c) Approval of any minutes of any meeting or meetings not previously approved.<br/>

(d) Election or appointment of committee chairmen and committee members.<br/>

(e) Disposition of any unfinished business.<br/>

(f) Consideration and disposition of any new business.<br/>

(g) Adjournment.<br/>
<strong>Section 2.14. Telephonic Meetings. </strong>Meetings of the 
Board may be held by telephone, electronic or similar communications 
equipment so long as all Trustees participating in such meeting can 
communicate with one another during such meeting. Participation in such a
 meeting constitutes presence in person at such meeting.<br/>
<strong>Section 2.15. Absentees Consent to Meetings. </strong>Actions
 taken at any meeting of the Board which may not have been duly called, 
noticed or convened (due to a lack of quorum or otherwise) shall be as 
valid as if taken at a meeting duly held if, either before or after the 
meeting, all of the Trustees entitled to vote who were not present in 
person (and those who, although present, either objected at the 
beginning of the meeting to the transaction of any business because the 
meeting had not been duly called, noticed, or convened, or expressly 
objected at the meeting to the consideration of matters not included in 
the notice which were required to be included therein) sign a written 
consent to the holding of the meeting and approval of the minutes of 
such meeting. All such consents and approvals shall be made a part of 
the minutes of the meeting.<br/>
<strong>Section 2.16. Action Without Meeting. </strong>Any action 
which may be taken at any meeting of the Board may be taken without a 
meeting, if a written consent to such action is signed by a majority of 
the Trustees. Whenever action is taken by written consent, a meeting 
need not be called, noticed or convened. All written consents of 
Trustees shall be filed with the minutes of meetings of the Board or 
committee.<br/>
<strong>Section 2.17. Powers. </strong>Except as otherwise provided 
by law, the Articles, and subject to Section 2.12, the Board is 
exclusively vested with the absolute, complete and unrestrained power 
and authority to manage the affairs of Oath Keepers, and is authorized 
and empowered to exercise any and every power and right of Oath Keepers 
in such manner as the Board may determine.<br/>
<strong>Section 2.18. No Compensation. </strong>No person shall receive any compensation for services as a Trustee.<br/>
<strong>ARTICLE III</strong><br/>
<strong>COMMITTEES</strong><br/>
<strong>Section 3.01. Establishment. </strong>The Board, in its 
discretion, may establish an executive committee and other committees 
having such powers and performing such duties as the Board may delegate 
to it by resolution from time to time, including the immediate oversight
 and management of certain business affairs of Oath Keepers. The Board 
shall appoint the persons to serve on such committees. The Board may 
appoint ex officio, trustees and officers.<br/>
<strong>Section 3.02. Term of Office. </strong>At the discretion of

the right of Oath Keepers, by reason of the fact that such person is or 
was a Trustee, committee member, officer, employee, or agent (including a
 manager) of Oath Keepers against judgments, fines, amounts paid in 
settlement, interest, expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees), 
and other liability actually and reasonable incurred; so long as the 
indemnitee acted in good faith and in a manner which such indemnitee 
reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interest of Oath
 Keepers and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no 
reasonable cause to believe the conduct was unlawful.<br/>

(b) Oath Keepers shall likewise indemnify each indemnitee who was or 
is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened,

 unlawful. The termination of any action, suit or proceeding by 
judgment, order or settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of <em>nolo contendere </em>or
 its equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a presumption that the 
person did not act in good faith or in a manner reasonably believed to

respect to any criminal action or proceeding, that there was reasonable 
cause to believe that the conduct was unlawful.<br/>

to the benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of such

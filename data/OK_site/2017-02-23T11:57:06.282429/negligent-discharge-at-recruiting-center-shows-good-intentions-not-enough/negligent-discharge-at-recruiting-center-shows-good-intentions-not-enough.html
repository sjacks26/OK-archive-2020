<p>The good news is, the armed citizen “guarding” a recruitment center in Lancaster, Ohio, who <strong><a href="http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/local/2015/07/23/recruiting-center-shot-fired.html" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/local/2015/07/23/recruiting-center-shot-fired.html', 'negligently discharged his rifle');">negligently discharged his rifle</a></strong>, was not an Oath Keeper, nor part of the sanctioned Protect the Protectors project.</p>
<p>“Thankfully, not one of ours.” Stewart Rhodes told me this morning via email. “Not an Oath Keepers member. Steve Frasure from Ohio confirmed that.”</p>
<p>Thank goodness for small favors, because the bad news is, this plays right into the hands of gleeful anti-gunners, who would demonstrably rather see recruiters dead than either armed or guarded. And the thing is, it’s the second time this guy – who says he was trying to clear ammunition to let “someone” look at his rifle — has had an ND, having been convicted and fined in 2013.</p>
<p>A while back, I attended an open carry demonstration in “progressive” college town Oberlin, where gun rights advocates were protesting an attempt by local hoplophobes to ban guns in city parks – a clear violation of Ohio preemption law.  A “reporter” asked one of the demonstrators to unholster and present his handgun so the cameraman could get a good shot of it for the viewers back home.</p>
<p>The gun rights advocate, to his credit, refused and told event organizers, who promptly put media on notice and announced to all present not to cooperate with such requests – particularly with law enforcement officers monitoring the crowd  who would not have been privy to why a handgun was being drawn in a crowd of people.</p>
<p>Basic safety rules are things Oath Keepers with real-world experience can share with all gun owners. So are command, discipline and training, all vital elements whether performing guard duty or participating in an armed event. Leaders organizing such operations must make certain those joining them understand all safety and conduct rules, which should be assured beforehand and then monitored for continued compliance.</p>
<p>Serious business is at hand that requires alertness and attention along with seriousness and maturity. If someone shows up and is resistant to that, you don’t need him.</p>
<p>Good intentions on the part of volunteers are not enough, because we all know where the road paved with them leads.</p>
<p>As for the antis: They’re going to have their fun with this and go full <strong><a href="http://www.bestofbeck.com/wp/activism/saul-alinskys-12-rules-for-radicals" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.bestofbeck.com/wp/activism/saul-alinskys-12-rules-for-radicals', 'Alinsky Rule 5');">Alinsky Rule 5</a></strong> on us. Don’t lose sight of the fact that for all their snotty ridicule, the “alternative” they offer is for attackers to be armed and victims to be defenseless. All the noise they make and insults they hurl can’t change that fundamental truth.</p>

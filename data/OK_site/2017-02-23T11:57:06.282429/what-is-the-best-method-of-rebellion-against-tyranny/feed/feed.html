<content:encoded>I agree with Brandon, when they occupied a federal building, I believe they gave up any moral authority they might have had in any of the ongoing protests over the mistreatment of the Hammonds, therein lies the argument for poor planning. We are a nation at war, the ideals of personal freedom backed up by personal responsibility are being challenged daily by other Americans who fail to connect those dots together. Personally I don’t believe that  Man, by himself has the capacity to do very much worthwhile outside of the presence of God in his life, it is for this reason that I am spending a great deal of my time asking my God to help us as a people, and a nation to do the right thing, to get on your knees and seek God for the ouster of those who the American people have foolishly elected to powerful positions in government, I don’t believe for one second that they will respond favorably to any request or demand that they obey the constitution they must have pledged to uphold, therefore in my heart and in my mind I am turning them, and their cause over to my God, who alone is faithful. I am thankful too that we are in an election year where there are people like Donald Trump, and TED Cruz running for president. This gives me renewed hope that we have a chance at least in restoring our constitutional Republic on that level. Thanks too to all the men currently in uniform, and all of you vets who swore to uphold, not politicians, but the Law of our land, the Constitution.

<content:encoded>One current resource to be utilized at getting to the puppet masters is the North American Law Center’s (<a href="http://northamericanlawcenter.org" rel="nofollow">http://northamericanlawcenter.org</a>) and the Constitutional Accountability Coalition’s (<a href="http://cactn.weebly.com" rel="nofollow">http://cactn.weebly.com</a>) articles of impeachment of the usurper in the oval office.  Get the articles in front of your congressman today and put the pressure on until we get one member of congress to present the articles of impeachment to the House Judiciary Committee.

<content:encoded>I fully agree with the message they were conveying but, as stated in another post, they were the tip of the sword only, the rest of the sword wasn’t present because not all were on board. Good article, thank you.

<content:encoded>While I do not agree with the command leadership and the way the Oathkeepers are being managed, this article is ok and I agree with some of the tactical things mentioned.. something I have been talking to those around me about quite extensively.   The biggest mistake most are making is just this.  Publicly talking about everything they are doing, who they are, location and so on.
<p>However there are some things, which I state at the end of my comment that I think are completely wrong in this article.. especially a near the end comment made in this article.</p>
<p>My ‘friends’ and any ‘groups’ any of us may or may not be a part of do not talk about it, we don’t spread the word.  We don’t even acknowledge anything at all in fact.  There is a whole lot bigger picture here and it is something 98% of those out there are missing.</p>
<p>But enough of my opinions on that</p>
<p>And so, and unless I missed it, there is one other huge factor missing in all this including the article.   A true and real leader.  And THAT we do not have.   And the leader will not be someone elected.  It will not be someone that gives themselves the power over others.  It will not be someone that forms a militia or like group and calls themselves the commander.  It will not be a talking head that plays political word games, back and forth about taking a stand then remaining peaceful.   It will not be someone that tells others what they are doing is wrong or that what they are feeling is wrong or that they should change their convictions and “save it for a later time”.</p>
<p>No, a real leader will be the one that people start listening to who tells it like it is.  Who has NO interest in getting those around him/her jailed or dead yet has enough tactical experience and training to know how and when to do something AND extract safely from it.  Someone that is not looking to start a war but knows it may come to having to fire on others.  But more important, someone that when they draw a line STANDS that line no matter what.</p>
<p>In the case or Oregon, it was a disorganized mess.. in MY opinion.  That being said, the groups that constantly talk about being patriots also showed their true colors.  What should have happened is an effort to get a show of people in support, UNARMED if need be to make the point that we were not going to just stand by and let this go quietly.  While that was taking place they then should have inundated major media and minor media with the FACTS backup by Constitutional Law and precedent.</p>
<p>If that did not work, then it should escalate until it did work.   You see when you say something and draw a line, the ONLY thing that gives that any power is by DOING.   If you draw a line only to find reasons and excuses, “oh this is not the right time, live to try again another day” or “don’t do this you will only end up in jail or dead” or so many other excuses I have heard, it pretty much tells everyone that in essence nothing will happen except a lot of keyboard commandos typing bull on the internet and talking tough when in reality they are not willing to stand.</p>
<p>When tyranny comes calling, you DO NOT HAVE THE CHOICE TO PICK AND CHOOSE YOUR BATTLE.</p>
<p>You either stand or you don’t.  Plain and simple.  You either make it clear, make it loud and make it public that you are standing against the wrong being done but you have no intent to escalate things but WILL NOT back down and will hold the line until the wrong(ed) has been made right by whatever means, change in the law, the courts, whatever.</p>
<p>Finally, the other thing lacking is the obvious tactical knowledge and training.. but more important the planning of any of this.  If you truly are going to stand, you don’t go off half cocked on a whim.   You take as much time as you can before you have to act and insure you have a tactical sound plan that EVERYONE will follow AND ABIDE BY.</p>
<p>From not only internal communications but external public and media communications.  From keeping watch both daytime AND at night to who is doing the cooking.   Other things include the RULES very complete and VERY specific on how members will and will not act and/or react.  _Planning for scouts, ingress and egress.  Escape and evade.  And numerous other things.</p>
<p>This is not a game.  It is not a joke.  We are talking about real life here.. and REAL dire consequences IF a true leader does not have what it takes to actually LEAD.</p>
<p>This article closed out with a statement that I COMPLETELY disagree with.  Near the end of this article is this statement:    “it IS possible to defy then defeat tyranny without a single shot being fired. That is what the Founders and their followers then and now would want us to do.”</p>
<p>WRONG.   First, here is the literal definition of TYRANNY:   </p>
<p>1) Cruel and oppressive government or rule. “people who survive war and escape tyranny”<br/>
2) synonyms:	despotism, absolute power, autocracy, dictatorship, totalitarianism, Fascism; More<br/>
3) a nation under cruel and oppressive government, cruel, unreasonable, or arbitrary use of power or control.</p>
<p>Tyranny has NEVER been defeated without force of arms.  We in the the USA are not yet under the confines of tyranny therefore we still have a chance AT resolving differences peacefully.   But should the day come where tyranny truly takes hold, there is NO WAY IN H E L L that tyranny will be but down without shots being fired.</p>
<p>And our founding fathers?   THAT comment was an insult to them for they too tried peacefully but when true tyranny struck, they took up arms and formed what we have today.  And our Founding Fathers would EXPECT US TO DO THE SAME THING TO PRESERVE THAT WHICH THEY STARTED.</p>
<p>What we need is a leader.  Someone that understands that.  Someone people can and will respect..  and someone those that understand and believe will follow.</p>

<content:encoded>“The best laid plans, of mice and men, often go awry”…self sacrifice my brothers; it’s a good faux death. All ancient warriors lived by this creed. From the samurai, to the native Americans. It’s better to die (spiritually) while standing than waste away in frailty; Without purpose nor meaning. It’s about giving your (spiritual) life for a cause. Something you believe in. Something that makes a difference for your children, and future generations. It’s a losing battle. A lost cause. Hopefully it will inspire a new generation of patriots. We can die emotionally, but live on…🇺🇸

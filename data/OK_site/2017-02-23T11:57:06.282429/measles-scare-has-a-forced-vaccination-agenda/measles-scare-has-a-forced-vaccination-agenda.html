<p>By Joel Skousen</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Several months ago there was a measles outbreak among the Amish where 383 people were infected, and (as usual) nobody came even close to death. The media hardly expressed concern except to criticize the Amish for not being vaccinated. Now comes the Disneyland infection and suddenly it’s a national security threat. The issue of mandating vaccines is being broadcast widely, almost as if we are dealing with a conspiracy of creating a crisis in order to justify squashing the anti-vaccine movement.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Why should the issues of measles raise such a fuss? Measles isn’t even lethal except to the few people who are very old or immuno-compromised and at risk from dozens of other minor threats. I can remember the time when we used to visit the homes of people with the Measles or Chicken Pox in order to get infected early and gain permanent immunity after recovery. It was widely known that this builds the immune system’s ability to handle diseases in general.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The anti-vaccine movement is strong in the US and for good reason. 1) That vaccines have resulted in numbers of dead, damaged and autistic children is well established, though hotly denied by vaccine makers, government, and the medical establishment—despite hard evidence. 2) Vaccines have a spotty record of effectiveness and the “immunity” isn’t permanent in most cases, hence the need for booster shots. 3) all the spotty benefits have to be weighed against the high level of danger inherent in vaccine ingredients including: foreign substances, toxic preservatives, and immune fooling adjuvants that cause many immune disorders that are often far worse than the vaccination target disease.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The medical journal, “Clinical Infectious Diseases,” published the finding that measles is often contracted and spread by those who have been vaccinated against it, and that “(1) MMR vaccines are not meaningfully effective and (2) those that choose not to be vaccinated pose no additional threat to those who choose to be.” The <a href="https://u134386.ct.sendgrid.net/wf/click?upn=-2Fs0EHiZgDxpaqaIuHhjNmNRxwwE7Tb9BuDpemr7P5Tf6AUhgcsBNSx6sGrAk3mBAUliO9YywSm7cJOo6nZ8LrX4q0iP-2Blk2L3ssT2pwKWAgpFDvOgiedI1dlI2T7JYJB_wxlJm9l5DuMp2wPynlYxGCvvecFGbVUJo-2FBIU7yiOBOa9PEs8QGlvVFfCTVLYztrmrsSo5nw3I62vaH2t1tdBGECPWmakQVegoyy-2F7CXoF61tyMmicJH0f0rBEO1E4uSo25Z51ZeqdPUkHL5OXQXdNXvhOqGQh-2FNbxPRgg-2F7FmeQAKnwrAxr03O-2B1BbnkeioeQAcvKUw4y3355NfAjFRcnuYlEoA32-2FMwZXc8EAforE-3D" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'https://u134386.ct.sendgrid.net/wf/click?upn=-2Fs0EHiZgDxpaqaIuHhjNmNRxwwE7Tb9BuDpemr7P5Tf6AUhgcsBNSx6sGrAk3mBAUliO9YywSm7cJOo6nZ8LrX4q0iP-2Blk2L3ssT2pwKWAgpFDvOgiedI1dlI2T7JYJB_wxlJm9l5DuMp2wPynlYxGCvvecFGbVUJo-2FBIU7yiOBOa9PEs8QGlvVFfCTVLYztrmrsSo5nw3I62vaH2t1tdBGECPWmakQVegoyy-2F7CXoF61tyMmicJH0f0rBEO1E4uSo25Z51ZeqdPUkHL5OXQXdNXvhOqGQh-2FNbxPRgg-2F7FmeQAKnwrAxr03O-2B1BbnkeioeQAcvKUw4y3355NfAjFRcnuYlEoA32-2FMwZXc8EAforE-3D', 'LA Times');" target="_blank">LA Times</a> confirmed that the measles vaccine doesn’t stop people from getting measles:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Even those who get the shots have a small risk of getting ill, especially if immunized in the 1980s or earlier. As the measles outbreak that started at Disneyland grew to at least 70 cases Wednesday, much of the attention has focused on how the vast majority of patients were not vaccinated for the highly contagious disease.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">But some medical experts also have expressed concern about the five patients who contracted measles despite being fully vaccinated. Their cases point to a lesser-known aspect of the measles vaccine: That even those who get the shots have a small risk of getting sick, especially older people who were immunized in the 1960s, ’70s and ’80s.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Of course, rather than admit to vaccine ineffectiveness, their answer was “we need more booster shots.” But the more you take of the MMR shot, the higher your risk, especially in children, of deadly reactions. As the Daily Sheeple reported,</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Keira Driscoll, a 5-year-old girl, died of the flu just three days after she was vaccinated.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It makes you wonder if she contracted the virus from the shot in the first place. Vaccine Inserts say recipients are contagious for 28 days, but you can be sure no one in government or the media will be asking that question. They don’t care about effectiveness or side effects. They have an ideological agenda to push, and it’s “Government is charged with securing public safety.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">But that’s not right. Government’s purpose is to keep people’s rights from being violated, not to ensure safety, which is almost impossible to define and enforce. Besides, once you give a bureaucrat the responsibility to ensure everyone’s safety, each person’s individual liberty becomes a threat to his job, and puts him in the position of looking like he has failed if anyone has a problem or an accident.</p>

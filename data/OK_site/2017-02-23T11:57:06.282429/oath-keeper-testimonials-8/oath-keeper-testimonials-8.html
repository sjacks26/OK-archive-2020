<p><strong>James “Vito” Lanese:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Testimonial: I am testifying as a Viet Nam veteran and a retired Correction Officer.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Our Constitution is under constant attack and erosion by progressive socialists who want to disarm us and turn us into a nation of drones. The 2nd Amendment, our right to keep and bear arms, is the only right in the Constitution in which the Federal Government’s permission is needed for us to exercise that right. It is a violation of our civil rights under the 4th &amp; 5th Amendments, when we have to fill out an “interrogation” form under penalty of perjury, without “probable cause” of a crime being committed, for which no warrant was issued to receive or be denied the permission to purchase a firearm. It is a violation of our civil rights under the 10th Amendment as nothing in the Constitution grants the Federal Government any authority to violate the 4th &amp; 5th Amendments or “infringe” upon the 2nd. I strongly feel that the 2nd Amendment is the people’s Amendment to “Uphold and Defend the Constitution.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I joined Oath Keepers to Uphold and Defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies foreign and domestic. I did not go to Viet Nam to fight for Communism. What traitors sign matters not ! I will not obey or comply with any law which does not derive it’s lawful authority from the Constitution. WE DO NOT NEED GOVERNMENTS PERMISSION TO EXERCISE OUR RIGHTS UNDER THE CONSTITUTION !</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Peter Moll:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Testimonial: My name is Peter. I am a former EMS technician from New Jersey currently residing in Toledo, Ohio with my fiancee. I didn’t have to take an oath to join the volunteer rescue squad in my town, my Oath was taken when I joined Oath Keepers.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I’m not a soldier, marine, airman or sailor, nor have I ever been. I am however an American citizen and as such I believe it is my solemn duty to defend and protect the Constitutional rights of my fellow citizens at all costs.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I will not fire the first shot, nor do I advocate violence in any form save in the last defense of our lives and our rights but if the day comes I will stand with my brothers and sisters in defiance of tyranny and for love of liberty and freedom.</p>
<p>With the greatest respect,</p>
<p>Peter</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Jason Young:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Testimonial: I was once in U.S. Army. I wasn’t able to make it all the way due to a bad knee. I still consider myself a former service member even though I didn’t completely finish basic. God, Family, and County are my three loves.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>ThePatriot2009:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Testimonial: I joined the US Army JUL 78 by my learning and knowing why I served started earlier from my Grandparents insisting we know and understand the Constitution of our Great Land. Even though I made a mistake while serving and even the Oath Keepers will not accept me into their ranks. I standby ready to give my life to defend the rights given to us by God. I may not be allowed to own Fire Arms But I am just as skilled and deadly with the bow and other skill sets I have worked on.  I hold no grudge for my mistakes made. God Bless and Keep up the Good Fight.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Donald Gilland Jr.:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Testimonial: As a veteran of the United States Army, from the Marne division, I will stand by my oath to defend the constitution of the United States of America against all enemies both foreign and domestic.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I am a veteran with prior duties as a fire support specialist. I will serve in any capacity that I can, where there is need.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">————————————————————————————————–</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Wolverine316:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Testimonial: I have been serving my country for over 22 years. I am currently in the Army Reserves. I can’t go into much of what I have done but I swear to God and to my military Oath that I will support and uphold my Constitutional Oath. At times I feel I have been failed but after trusting my heart, I learned that if I trust God, my heart and follow my Oath of the Constitution, I will do what it takes to defend the Constitution of the United States.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">————————————————————————————————–</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.oathkeepers.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/EagleGlobeandAnchor-e1435173385533.jpg"><img alt="EagleGlobeandAnchor" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6931" height="386" src="https://www.oathkeepers.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/EagleGlobeandAnchor-e1435173385533.jpg" width="500"/></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>John Ryff:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Testimonial: I am a Marine Corps Veteran who took the oath in 1980 and honorably served until 1994. My father was a Marine as are one of my son’s, currently a Staff Sergeant serving on active duty.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When I took the oath I merely understood my sworn oath was to support and defend the Constitution against all enemies Foreign and Domestic. I was 18 years old and I joined during the Iran Hostage crisis. To me it only meant to go to Iran when I graduated boot camp and bring our American citizens home and to go wherever it was necessary to fight for freedom around the world.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Although our oath states “Foreign and Domestic” it never occurred to me back then, or even until a decade or so ago, what “Domestic” really meant. Many American still today are not aware of the decades upon decades of the process to erode America from the inside out, removing God from everywhere and anywhere possible, playing down American Exceptionalism, the repeated attempts to completely remove our Constitution and Bill of Rights from the history books used to educate our children, playing down the importance of God, and even mocking it openly throughout our society.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As with many American’s, I have been so busy trying to make ends meet and to best provide for my family that I, until about 10 years ago, started to realize and “connect the dots” if you will, as to what was happening in our great Nation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I have had the pleasure of traveling to several dozen countries while serving actively in the Marine Corps, and to every state dozens and dozens of times as a commercial driver traveling over the road and I have to say, although it may seem harsh, Americans by and large, are the dumbest mammals on the planet. I say that because unlike the Chinese citizens, or the citizens of any Communist society past or present, WE HAVE RIGHTS AND WE HAVE A CHOICE! Most Americans often choose or have chosen to allow someone else to be in control of their destiny and have failed to exercise their rights to the point that they no longer even understand what they are. It was not until recently that I learned from Sheriff Mack that the county sheriff is the highest law enforcement officer in the land. Why didn’t I know that already?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There are many things that I have learned over the past 10 years as I woke up, and every day as I continue to “awaken”. I have been involved with several organizations over the past few years and have always ended up being disappointed as the group’s focus seemed to blur or it was “one dimensional”. Don’t get me wrong, there is nothing wrong with being prepared for anything as we all know that there is a storm on the horizon. Nothing wrong with learning how to preserve food, stock up on supplies etc., but many of these groups that I have previously been involved with were merely “survivalists”. You cannot win ANYTHING with defense alone, for any battle to be won; you must have offense as well. Our offense consists of our God given rights that are protected under our Constitution, these rights as set forth by our founding fathers were done so for this specific purpose, for times just as those that we now find ourselves facing.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I joined the Oath Keepers in 2010 while working in NC but was never contacted or communicate with by anyone in the organization. It was not until recently I met our Florida Chapter President and re-engaged with the organization. I have been asked and eagerly accepted the position as an Oath Keeper Regional Director. I am excited about working with an organization that is NON-POLITICAL and has “focus” that being God and Country, our Constitution, Bill of Rights and to reach, teach and inspire our fellow American Citizens. We all can make a difference by doing this. If each member were to “wake up” a dozen or so Americans and they in turn do the same, we will grow in numbers very quickly.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I am a small business owner; let me say a small struggling business owner but I am willing to make the time to do whatever it takes to do my part. It does not take much, an hour here, an hour there, maybe only a few minutes to make a difference.  Whether at work talking with an associate, talking with family, friends or neighbors, or simply being approached by someone asking about the organization because you are wearing an Oath Keeper shirt. A few minutes of your time can make a huge difference. I am looking forward to working with all of you and supporting the Oath Keepers organization and mission. Semper Fi!</p>

## Stewart Rhodes; Sgt. Joshua May

SR: We know gun confiscation happened during Katrina. That’s one of the reasons I started OK, because of that atrocious example. I knew from my experience as a paratrooper that there are people of honor and integrity in the military who would not do such things. Until now, we didn’t have evidence of that happening during Katrina. This is an interview with Sgt. Joshua May of Utah National Guard, who did stand down and refuse. In fact, his entire unit refused.

SR: (0:00:33.6) I’m here with JM. We just met today. Sheriff Mack and I were up here yesterday giving a speech in Logan, Utah. We heard about JM. You’re now a Staff Sergeant?

JM: Correct

SR: We heard about his story. In Katrina, we didn’t realize this, but there were people who refused to participate in gun confiscation. JM was one of them. Tell us your story.

JM: (0:01:02.9) We were down in the SW part of the state, in a more rural area. There were rumors that martial law was in effect and that we might be part of gun confiscation.

SR: You were in an intelligence unit at the time?

JM: Yes. We were going down to pull security, is what we heard at first, and help our brothers and sisters. In a town called Erath. (0:01:44.8) A group of us had gotten together and talked about whether this was the right thing to do. We came to the consensus that no, we will not be taking firearms. When we got there, because I was the loud mouth of the group, they asked me to talk to the commander. I did, I explained to us that there’s a group of us who won’t do that. He told us at that time that’s not happening here, don’t worry about it. In that area, we didn’t have any problems. 

SR: In fact, you had some interactions with local folks who were taking care of their own security. 

JM: (0:02:22.7) Yeah. The first night, we ran into these folks. They were meeting on the front lawn of one of these homes. When we came up the first time, they were standoffish. It took a few days, maybe a week to get them to open up to us. What they were doing, they would meet and say, one of their neighbors was having stuff pilfered. Fridges are big items on the FEMA credit card. They were taking the fridges away to sell them or put on their front lawns. So these guys were providing security at their neighbors’ houses. When we first came up, they were standing on a front lawn and some were armed. They thought we were there to take away their weapons. They had heard the rumors that martial law was in effect and we were gonna take them. It took us several days to convince them that’s not why we were there. One we convinced them, they started giving us a lot of intel, saying this is what’s happening around town. It became a really good working relationship (0:03:23.2)

SR: There were shotguns and rifles?

JM: Sure. Shotguns, hunting rifles.

SR: How many guys were on the lawn?

JM: 20-30

SR: So half the town?

JM: Probably. It was a really small town. Probably a third to half of the town’s adult males.

SR: (0:03:36.5) What were you guys doing exactly? Helping pull security?

JM: We had a static guard that watched over the water and MREs being handed out. At nighttime, during the curfew, we had somebody watch that. The police department asked us to also have a roving guard, to help them keep eyes on. For their night shift, there was only one officer on duty. So we had a radio and we would give them info.

SR: (0:04:09.2) That’s when you pulled up to these guys?

JM: That’s when we pulled up, on our roving guard, me and my buddy I was with. It was tense the first few times. And they would move around to different people’s houses, and it was always before curfew, they were always off the street by curfew. They decided these are the houses we’re going to watch tonight, and they’d split up and get into the houses before curfew, then after curfew, they’d come back out. 

SR: So when you guys first got there, you heard these rumors and you sat down together and talked, among the enlisted.

JM: Correct. There were some junior officers too. They probably wouldn’t be happy that I said that. They were involved too. The Constitution loving people were there going, nuh-uh, we’re not doing this.

SR: Out of your company, you’re talking how many men? 

JM: (0:04:54.8) By the time I went to talk to the commander, it was more than half the company. A large percentage, probably 2/3.

SR: Others were saying nothing at all? What were others saying?

JM: Others were sitting in the back, seeing how it would play out. In the MI field, it’s hard to create waves, because you have security clearances. Even me talking about this now.

SR: So people are worried about security clearances?

JM: (0:05:22.8) Yeah people worry about that. They’re afraid to talk even if things aren’t classified. They don’t want someone to spin it on them.

SR: So they were sitting back and seeing what would happen, but at least half were outspoken.

JM: Well, within our group. They would talk to people if they were asked, but I’m bull-headed, so I take it head on.

SR: So they kind of recruited you, volunteered you to be the guy.

JM: Correct. That’s been happening since I’ve been in the military, for 10 years. I’m always the guy that gets put in front of the colonel or whoever to tell him our side.

SR: Right. It takes one man to do what’s right sometimes. But half your company was committed, pretty adamant that they’re not going to confiscate firearms.

JM: Correct

SR: And you went up to your commander, and his response was we’re not doing that here, don’t worry about it.

JM: We’re not going to be doing that, don’t worry about it, that’s not our mission.

SR: (0:06:14.2) But later you were deployed into the city.

JM: New Orleans, yes. And it was a long bus ride, so again the talks came up.

SR: On the way there? 

JM: On the way there. And it’s really happening there, what are we gonna do?

SR: So you knew that in New Orleans, it was happening.

JM: The rumors were it was going on. The rumors were it’s actually happening. So without actual intel, because we weren’t collecting it ourselves, we didn’t know. It was rumored. We were nervous the whole bus ride. So we talked and talked and decided again, no, if this is the case, we’re not going to do it.

SR: (0:06:53.8) You were there as part of the entire National Guard of Utah?

JM: Yes. There was a bunch of us. In New Orleans, we actually took up the entire rec facility of the University we stayed on. The gym, the offices. 

SR: Which university was that?

JM: Loyola of New Orleans, I think. We took up a large place there. A lot of guys. Some of the guys from the other units, too, not just MI, were hearing what we were talking about and said I’m on board with that too.

SR: We’re not going to do these things.

JM: Yeah, we’re not doing that either

SR: (0:07:30.0) So you went back to your commander again?

JM: We had a formation. They were trying to dispel rumors. They said we know there’s a rumor of martial law and weapons confiscation. We’re not involved in that, that’s not our mission. So don’t worry. I’m a loud-mouth and we were not in a formal setting, so I said doesn’t matter if we’re allowed or not, that’s wrong and people need to know that. I was asked by my commander to come speak with him offline, away from everyone else

SR: Doesn’t matter whether we’re involved or not?

JM: Right. My point was it’s wrong, we shouldn’t be doing this. I don’t care who’s doing this, as members of the military that’s not what we should be doing. (0:08:10.5) Show me in the Constitution where it says we do that. So I stepped offline with a couple of guys from the original group and talked to the commander, and said sir if it comes to that point and we’re asked by other groups to help them, we will not do it. If that’s what it comes to, you can send me home now. I won’t do it. He said don’t worry, we’ll never ask you. I said it’s not just me, it’s the majority of this task force here, all feel the same way. I’m just the only loud-mouth.

SR: Do you think the other elements within the Utah Guard that were there had already been discussing it amongst themselves? (0:08:50.6) Or did it spread from your unit? Was it all your fault?

JM: I don’t think it was all my fault, I was just the loudest person. It wasn’t like they just came into the conversation and said oh that sounds good. It seemed they had been discussing it a little bit. And when they heard me using my loud voice indoors, saying I won’t do it and neither should you, they came in and said we feel the same way and we’ve been discussing it too what would we do. If you guys are on board, we’re behind it.

SR: What did the commander say as far as how he’s going to communicate this to Big Army or somebody else?

JM: (0:09:35.7) Being in his position, I can see where it would be difficult. He said, because Big Army was there

SR: 82nd Airborne was there.

JM: 82nd was there, in the French Quarter. He says Big Army, which made me perk up and go woah, why are they even here? We’d heard reports they would be there, but we thought, why are we using active-duty soldiers here? That’s not their job. They only know one thing.

SR: Your perspective was this is the job of the national guard.

JM: It’s the job of the National Guard. It was a volunteer mission. I remember telling my employer at the time, this is what I joined up to do. I joined to help my fellow citizens, that’s why I went National Guard and not active duty. I would have loved to see the world and be somewhere every 3 years. I joined National Guard because it’s my job to go help my brothers and sisters.

JM: (0:10:31.6) I’d like to challenge my fellow service members, the same challenge my buddy gave me years ago. Know your Constitution, know why you put your hand up and said yes I will. You need to understand that and what your obligation to that is. If you remember your oath, you solemnly swore to do that, so help you god. Take it seriously.

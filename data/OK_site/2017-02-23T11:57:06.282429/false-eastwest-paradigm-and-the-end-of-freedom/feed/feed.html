<content:encoded>Absolutely correct, we need to question everything and do our own research.  Kissinger has caused so much destruction in his path, along with Brezinski and others that are firmly committed to the globalist agenda.  It is a complete illusion that we have a choice in choosing our President too, it has already been decided and the rest is a dog and pony show.  Excellent article and thanks for all you do!

<content:encoded>Brandon, Murf just proved your point concerning the need for a  hero and the effectiveness of the one worlders’ paradigm.<br/>
One of the problems for growth within the liberty movement is that so many don’t want to pay attention; explanations of what’s wrong and how to correct are too complex; accusing is easier than refuting.  We may know too much and present too complicated explanations for new recruits as well as risk their total discouragement.<br/>
From reading comments, it appears many who already believe themselves to be liberty minded, suffer from the same reluctance to get engaged with the complex issues.<br/>
My questions to you are, “How do we approach the newbys and potential recruits with a simple message?  Can you think of specific talking points that stand a greater chance of not turning off potential converts to the cause?”<br/>
Thanks for any response.

<content:encoded>Left &amp; Right is long dead, but here in Britain we have very skilled taxidermists. A few brave souls are breaking out, but the last business in the world to be deregulated will be politics. The weird thing is, we call these things ideologies, but the one thing that terrifies their followers is ideas.<br/>

<content:encoded>Buy gold if you feel like it, but you are not preparing for “patriotic martyrdom”.  
<p>You are preparing to remove corrupt people who refuse to go, who created mass Election Fraud so we cannot change them to better people, who have created 2 factions (political parties) that run our elections unlawfully, etc.</p>
<p>You are preparing to live as we should be under the US Constitution within our constitutional republic.  It will be a change, but you will actually do better financially under a real money system, few taxes, no one taking (stealing) your property for unlawful yearly taxes (they can charge property tax one time when it is purchased, not carry a lease on it), etc.</p>
<p>Be excited, as you can be what you want to be, as will your children, if any with no government or at least VERY minimal government interference.   You will commit time to train for the Militia, but isn’t that better then the IRS, FDA, BLM, “civil forfeiture” (theft again), etc?</p>

<content:encoded>“We gave too much power to leaders in the first place and they’ve used it against us. So yes, we’re definitely naive and apathetic…..we can accept no other verdict”
<p>NO, we did not give them too much power, you are incorrect in that assumption.  Those that serve within our governments usurped powers that are not theirs to use.</p>
<p>We are/were naive, but notice that every time Obama opens his mouth arms sells goes up, that is actions speaking louder then words.  Do not believe because many do not speak, that they will not act in defense of our nation.</p>
<p>Remember, the lies that is spewed forth from those that serve within our governments are many, and those that they hire/contract to make it seem that many agree or will do nothing, or are just plain stupid does not always apply.</p>
<p>People are starting to realize that the 501c3 churches are bought and paid for government agencies, that the (corporate) media is a mouthpiece using treasonous talking heads to spout their propaganda.</p>
<p>Never despair, though allow yourself sadness, and counter it with things you love to be as normal as one can in our times of trouble.  Stay away from anything big pharma pushes, and READ the US Constitution – understand that EVERY single word and punctuation has meaning.  If you do not understand turn to the debates, the framers words, old court decisions (much easier read then the ones today, and constitutional in nature (so far that I have found).</p>
<p>Study the real history so that you can recognize it when you see it being repeated – and it IS being repeated.</p>
<p>The only pro-active action you should be taking is to train to be the Militia of your state, as they are constitutionally mandated, join CPT teams, save seeds, learn a skill you can trade later if you do not have one, think about a business you can do, as we need AMERICAN manufacturing for America and the people – not this “stuff” we get from slave nations, etc.  </p>
<p>Brandon has a map above shows the locations of Local Groups formed by users. Whenever a new Local Barter Group becomes established, they will add it to the map!  It can be found at <a href="http://alt-market.com/" rel="nofollow">http://alt-market.com/</a> that is handy.</p>
<p>There are lots of positive things we can do, we just must get out of the paradigm they had us in, think for ourselves, come up with ideas, understand that not succeeding at first is learning how to do something in a better way and do them in a better way.</p>
<p>What happens here in America is a large part dependent on us.  One has to decide if they love our nation and our way of life enough to change to keep it, if so, do so.</p>

<content:encoded>Thanks, but am not that is deserved.  
<p>We all must learn what we can about our government as it really is, not as it is presented to us to meet the needs of those who wish to destroy us.</p>

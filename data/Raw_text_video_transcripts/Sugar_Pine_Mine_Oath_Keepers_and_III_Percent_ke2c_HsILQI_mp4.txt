Joseph Rice: [00:00:07] Hi my name is Joseph Rice. A week ago Rick came to our monthly Oath Keeper meeting and he requested the Oath Keepers of Josephine County assist him in protecting his constitutional right to due process. The BLM had served notice upon him to remove his mining equipment from his claim. We discussed this. We did a site survey that following Saturday and during that site's survey we discovered that BLM had an intent to come in the next Tuesday and possibly burn his cabin. In preparation of that we immediately move security teams in place to protect his property, And his cabin, and his Fifth Amendment right to due process. Since then we have put out a national call for mobilization into the area here. I do request everyone go to Oath Keepers joco dot com. That's Oath Keepers. J o c o dot com for operational procedures and protocols. If you are going to provide assistance. the other thing we request is on that web page you can support the staging and the security operation. But more importantly we need to help them with their legal defense fund. Rick and George are gearing up for a long legal battle with BLM and it takes a community and national support to help them with that. Since Oath Keepers has been on site we have secured his operation. We've done it professionally and we've done it with operational security. Fortunately with that we have had the Three Percenters come in and join us. They have been a professional group and they have served under our unified command to protect his rights and ensure the constitutional right to due process. without the support of like minded patriot Constitutionally focus groups would not be able to do what we're doing here today. I would request every one stop The gossip, stop the rumor control. You have heard it directly from the claim owner's mouth. Exactly what happened exactly what occurred. There is a misinformation campaign Occurring on social media. I ask that you disregard that and once again for all current information of what is happening here. Oath Keepers joco dot com. We will be posting a situation report. This is not a stand off with BLM. We are not provoking a confrontation with BLM. We are protecting the constitutional right to due process and we are pleased to have the Three Percenters join us in this fight. Thank you

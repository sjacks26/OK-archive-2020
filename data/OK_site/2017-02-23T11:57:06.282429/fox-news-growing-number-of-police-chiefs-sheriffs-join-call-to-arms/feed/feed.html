<content:encoded>That’s a excellent point, it would be a serious draw to the cause.

<content:encoded>If these sheriffs and police chiefs are serious about citizens protecting themselves maybe they should consider starting a CPT program of their own and encourage gun-owners to join so they can better protect themselves from bigger threats like ISIS, MS-13 or out of control government.

<content:encoded>If you take a look at the 13th amendment you may notice something interesting. Although the 13th amendment abolished slavery, it included a specific exception for convicts. 
<p>It is not prohibited by the 13th for a person duly convicted of a crime to be compelled to work. This is not a loophole that was invented by politicians or lawyers after the fact. It actually says it right there in the amendment itself. Imagine that. </p>
<p>So the 13th contains one exception. How many exceptions does the 2nd amendment contain? None, whatsoever.</p>
<p>Food for thought.</p>

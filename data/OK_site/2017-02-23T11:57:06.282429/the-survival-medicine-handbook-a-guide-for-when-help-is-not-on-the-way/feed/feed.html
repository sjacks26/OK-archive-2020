<content:encoded>Excellent article.  Thank you.  This title will be in my library soon.  As you were so good as to help me, allow me to return the favor by suggesting two additional titles for your consideration and that of those OK members preparing to provide medical assistance in austere conditions.
<p>“Where There is No Doctor”  Written as a guide specific to the creation of a community based medical effort.  If you Google this you’ll find a LOT of entries.  Please read the Wikipedia entry where you’ll find that it has been very well reviewed by some renowned medical facilities.  It is the staple document of docs and nurses who work with missionary and NGO medical missions in third world nations.  You can buy this as a paperback book anywhere.  If you prefer, you may download the 2011 version here:<br/>

<p>“Improvised Medicine: Providing Care in Extreme Environments”  December 6, 2011<br/>
by Kenneth Iserson.  This is another very useful reference for those preparing to assist in austere conditions. This reference is largely for experienced docs and nurses, but an EMT-B and certainly any EMT-I or “P” could put it to extremely good use.  You can pick this up virtually anywhere books are sold.  Mine came from Amazon.</p>
<p>Thank you again for your review and recommendation.  I look forward to hearing more from you and OK on this and other matters.</p>

R: Protestors took down these gates and threw a few into the reflecting pool, allowing people to take in the grandeur of Lincoln up close, at least for now.

MOP: I really like it. It’s a good thing. I saw where the people had taken the barricades down. I applaud them for that.

R: It was a big deal for Tim Cronen and his family, they’re visiting from Canada. They’re among the thousands of tourists who have been shut out of museums and memorials because of the federal shutdown.

TC: It’s wonderful to see it open. I just wish it were under better circumstances.

R: They have veterans to thank for that. Veterans angry over the shutdown. They’ve protested at the WW2 memorial, dismantling the barriers and carrying them straight to the White House fence.

CH: This is going to be ugly if this fence keeps coming in here.

R: It was here that things grew heated, some clashed with police. Those who served feeling like they’re not being respected. Many veterans benefits and services are on hold.

BV: I hope that Congress, the President, our politicians, would take a look and say there’s something wrong here.

R: Tonight, sightseers say they agree with those who took down the barriers.

MS: People are doing it very respectfully and politely and not aggressively, I applaud that.

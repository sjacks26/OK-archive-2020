<p>Be prepared to begin seeing stories of turmoil in Bulgaria; even a new “Color Revolution”, as the importance of the Ukraine diminishes and Bulgaria increases. It is all part of the “Order Out Of Chaos” plan of the New World Order. Country after country will be destabilized to prepare the populaces for a new One World Government that will, of course, be the savior of all. Stay tuned, and watch it unfold. – Shorty Dawkins, Associate Editor</p>

<p>by Tyler Durden</p>
<p>A few days ago, <a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2014-06-24/putin-scores-another-historic-victory-austria-signs-south-stream-pipeline-deal-defia" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2014-06-24/putin-scores-another-historic-victory-austria-signs-south-stream-pipeline-deal-defia', 'when we wrote our “explainer');" target="_blank">when we wrote our “explainer</a>” on the need for Russia to have an alternative pathway for its gas, one which bypasses Ukraine entirely and as the current “<em>South Stream” </em>framework  is set up, crosses the Black Sea and enters Bulgaria before passing  Serbia and Hungary on the way to the Central European energy hub located  in Baumgarten, Austria, we said that “one short month after Putin  concluded the Holy Grail deal with Beijing, he not only managed to  formalize his conquest of Europe’s energy needs with yet another  pipeline, one which completely bypasses Ukraine (<strong>for numerous reasons but mostly one: call it a Plan B</strong>),  but scored a massive political victory by creating a fissure in the  heart of the Eurozone, after Austria openly defied its European peers  and sided with Putin.”</p>
<p><img alt="plan B" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-19064" height="471" src="https://oathkeepers.org/oath/wp-content/uploads/plan-B.png" title="plan B" width="450"/></p>
<p>Today we find just what said Plan B is.</p>
<p>As <a href="http://en.itar-tass.com/economy/738060" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://en.itar-tass.com/economy/738060', 'Itar-Tass reports');" target="_blank">Itar-Tass reports</a>, citing Gazprom CEO Alexei Miller, “<strong>Russia’s gas giant Gazprom does not rule out gas transit via Ukraine may be stopped completely</strong>.”</p>
<p>“What happened once is a tendency, nothing happens incidentally. In  2009, gas supplies were stopped completely — so, we know precedents,”  Miller told a briefing on Friday.</p>
<p>Clearly, this is bad news for Ukraine: Gazprom not interested in participation in Ukraine’s gas transportation system (GTS), “<strong>train has departed”, </strong>CEO said.</p>
<blockquote><p>“<strong>The train has already departed. It seems it departed yesterday</strong>,”  Miller said. “It belongs to no one. The GTS has no owner,” he said.  “The GTS of Ukraine does not belong to Naftogaz but to the Ukrainian  government. Before discussing things with someone regarding  modernization and cooperation, it should appear on the balance sheet of  this or that economic entity.”</p>
<p>“Property and legal issues should be resolved first,” Miller said.</p></blockquote>
<p>In fact, the civil war torn country may soon lose all leverage it had  with both Europe and Russia as a transit hub for natural gas, which  also means that it is quite likely that Ukraine is about to be abandoned  by its western allies who will no longer have any practical use for  it.</p>
<p>The Gazprom chief added that “a dozen Ukrainian laws need to be changed to be able to do something with the GTS.”</p>
<p>Confirming that Ukraine’s leverage at least with Russia is now  effectively zero, Gazprom’s CEO also said that “As for the continuation  of negotiations with Ukraine, today there is no subject for talks.  First, they must repay their debts.”</p>
<p>“The gas price for Ukraine is fair – this price is fixed in the contract,” he stressed.</p>
<p>There have been no requests on the part of Ukraine’s national oil and  gas company Naftogaz Ukrainy on a change of the transit deal with  Russia, Alexei Miller said. Miller told journalists that it would be bad  news if such requests had been received.</p>
<p>At least we now know what the Ukraine endgame will look like: as  Russian transit through the country is completely cut off, the nation  will lose all strategic importance first to Russia and then to Europe,  which is still over-reliant on Russian gas (see map below), but which  will increasingly turn its attention to the countries which the South  Stream passes through.</p>

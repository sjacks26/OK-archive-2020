<p style="text-align: justify;">By Shorty Dawkins</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Lindsey Graham has shown himself unfit to be President of the United States, (or, for that matter, a US Senator). I give you his own words as evidence for my assertion. In speaking before a Republican gathering in Concord, New Hampshire, (where he is judging his political strength in a possible run for the Presidency), he said the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“And here’s the first thing I would do if I were president of the United States. I wouldn’t let Congress leave town until we fix this. I would literally use the military to keep them in if I had to. We’re not leaving town until we restore these defense cuts. We are not leaving town until we restore the intel cuts.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It is truly mind-boggling to hear a US Senator say those words. You can hear him for yourself <a href="http://benswann.com/graham-military-force-congress/" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://benswann.com/graham-military-force-congress/', 'here');" target="_blank" title="Ben Swann audio clip">here</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">What Lindsey Graham is advocating is none other than the destruction of the Constitution and our Republic, in blatant terms. He is saying he would use the military to force Congress to restore the budget cuts to the military and intelligence services. Quite simply, he is saying he would use military force to pass legislation he supports. This is what happens in a dictatorship, not in a Constitutional Republic.</p>
<p>Vox News, <a href="http://www.vox.com/2015/3/11/8193751/lindsey-graham-military-coup" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.vox.com/2015/3/11/8193751/lindsey-graham-military-coup', 'in an article about his words');" target="_blank" title="Vox News">in an article about his words</a>, had this to say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“What Lindsey Graham is proposing is to physically force members of Congress to vote how he commands. His plan violates constitutional separation of powers in just about the most extreme way imaginable, by forcing the executive branch’s will on the legislature. And it is a pretty safe bet that Senate rules do not grant the president authority to have the 101st Airborne Division occupy the Capitol until Congress votes the way he wants.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“Graham’s proposal is so astonishing that it’s pretty much impossible to believe that’s what he really meant. He is a mainstream politician and an attorney who served as an Air Force JAG. Surely — surely — he is not actually proposing such an unconstitutional action.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Some might say he misspoke. His own spokesperson has clarified to <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2015-03-12/how-a-lindsey-graham-joke-turned-into-a-coup-plot-against-the-government" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2015-03-12/how-a-lindsey-graham-joke-turned-into-a-coup-plot-against-the-government', 'Bloomberg');" target="_blank" title="Bloomberg article">Bloomberg</a> that when Graham said “I would literally use the military to keep them in if I had to,” that statement was “not to be taken literally.”. So, when are we to take his words literally? Does he ever mean what he says? Or is he to be taken literally only when it suits him?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Lindsey Graham is advocating treason, pure and simple. Not content with the political process laid out in our Constitution, the Supreme Law of the Land, he advocates using the military to enforce his own agenda. Lindsey Graham should be ashamed of himself. An apology to the American people is in order, but more than an apology is needed. It is time for Senator Graham to give up his quest for the Presidency and to resign as the Senator from South Carolina. He obviously has no respect, or belief in, our Constitution and our Republic. He took an Oath “to support and defend the Constitution from all enemies both foreign and domestic”. It seems to me that he is one of those domestic enemies of the Constitution.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For the Republic,</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Shorty Dawkins</p>

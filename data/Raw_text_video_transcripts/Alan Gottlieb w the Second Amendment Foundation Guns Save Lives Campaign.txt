Opening caption: “June 15th 2011. Alan Gottlieb with the Second Amendment Foundation and the Citizens Committee for the Right to Keep and Bear Arms, held a rally at Discount Firearms in Las Vegas to promote their ‘Guns Save Lives’ Campaign.”
Next caption: “This campaign was launched in response to Mayor Bloombergs Anti-Gun Campaign.”

1st speaker: Truck traveling the country to counter the message by Mayor Bloomberg who wants to remove firearms from our community. Says over 2000 Americans use firearms to protect themselves every day. 600k events each year, not where firearms are discharged, but used to ward off threats. Alan Gottlieb bio. Alan has appeared on over 3800 radio and TV shows, including PBS, CNN, ABC, Fox, NBC, ESPN, etc.

AG: Thanks to Discount Firearms for helping us with this rally. Good morning gun lobby. The Constitution is a piece of paper, requires us to defend it, or it will die. This is the heart of our national campaign to counteract Mayor Bloomberg. He only tells one side of the equation. Legislators and the American public need both sides of the equation to make the right decision. Many Americans use firearms for legitimate law-abiding purposes. Our 2000 Americans each day using firearms to protect themselves is using the most conservative numbers, from John Lott’s studies. Studies go from 800,000 legitimate firearm events each year to well over 2million. (0:04:30.1) We’re keeping our truck on the road as long as he keeps his truck on the road.

AG: Important congressional hearings going on today, held by Issa, on Project Gunrunner aka Fast and Furious. Most of you know about this ATF program. Over 200 citizens in Mexico plus some in America have died as a result of these firearms. Why did they do it? Obama and Holder said 90% of guns used in crime in Mexico traced to US; we proved their numbers were bogus; they started this program to make their numbers. It’s not people like us selling guns to people who shouldn’t have them, it’s our government doing that (0:05:56.9). We’re making sure they’ll be held accountable with these hearings in Congress. These are the people who are supposed to enforce gun laws, they’re putting guns in the hands of criminals. (0:07:05.0)

AG: We’re winning 2A rights one lawsuit at a time. You all know DC v. Heller. McDonald v Chicago extended DC v Heller to the states. NC has emergency power laws that can suspend 2A rights, we’re challenging those in court. 31 states have similar laws. 20 additional lawsuits since Chicago ruling, on various gun issues. Info about those lawsuits on our website, SAF.org. (0:09:40.8) We need to do this quickly. Obama has been stacking courts with anti-gun judges. He’s not named anybody to any court that supports 2A rights (0:10:11.4). Thanks for being here.

1st speaker: Thanks for being here, Alan. Thanks to the sponsors. Thanks to the Oath Keepers for coming out and standing with us. Tell American people the truth, everyone, don’t just talk to gun owners about this stuff. We can’t rely on government to defend our freedoms, that’s on us. (0:12:14.7)

## Jason Van Tatenhove; Brandon Curtiss (leader of III% Idaho)

JVT: We’re in Burns, Oregon. You’ve been here as a presence with Pacific Patriots Network

BC: Yep

JVT: You’re one of the founders of that. Give us a breakdown of what your role has been since you’ve been here.

BC: The role when we first got involved with the Hammond case back in October, November

## Video cuts at 0:00:41.4

BC: We’re trying to bring awareness to the Hammonds’ case and the injustices they’ve had to deal with through the BLM and the federal government and the due process that’s failed them. We’ve been involved in this area since October, November (0:01:00.7). They did not appeal, they weren’t able to bring any change in the case through the date they were to report to prison. On January 2, we held a rally in support of the Hammonds, to show them and the community that we support and love them, and respect their decision to turn themselves in to prison. Even though we may not agree with that situation, we support and respect their decision. (0:01:29.0) After the rally, Ammon Bundy decided he was going to take what he called a hard stance and went up and occupied the Malheur Wildlife Refuge building. Now we’re in town in the capacity to deal with that situation, to insert ourselves as a neutral 3rd party (0:01:48.2) on a security operation if you will, to provide security for the safety of the community, the law enforcement agencies, as well as Ammon and his crew.

JVT: You’re doing things beyond that scope, too. I’ve noticed you’ve done a lot of interacting with the community, whether that’s digging out fire hydrants or talking to the mother of the sheriff in town. There’s more going on than just providing that security buffer. Talk about that.

BC: (0:02:24.9) One of the things is the responsibility to educate the people around the area as this goes on. Their curiosity is going to educate them, but they’ve been talking to us and we’ve been approaching them, trying to entrench ourselves in the community to educate them. That’s why we’re here. What the reason is of the statement Ammon’s trying to portray, which we all agree with the statement, we all understand that there’s a problem with federal overreach in land and mineral and mining and all the things going on. Something needs to be done, something needs to change. The community in general (0:03:01.2) is starting to back more and more. A good example is the meeting, it wasn’t a meeting, we were having breakfast near the sheriff’s department. And she came over to us to talk to use, to understand why we’re here. After speaking with her, she had a greater understanding why we’re here and supported that.

JVT: And at first she was trepidatious, wanted to let us know that she disagreed with what we were doing. But by the end of that (0:03:20.5), that tone had changed. It’s part of winning the hearts and minds of people, doing the community service also does that. But you’re also taking a hard stance. You did something pretty groundbreaking, you actually went to where the FBI is with their tactical headquarters and you waited for them to interface with you. You did this with the sheriff as well. Tell us about what happened with the FBI (0:03:50.4)

BC: After we left a meeting with Ammon and his guys and went over the articles of resolution to try to get talking points for people to come to the table, we immediately went and wanted to discuss that with the FBI at their staging area. So we went to what was supposed to be their secret staging area and met with the guys at the gate. Our entire convoy did show up there. We didn’t come in any type of an aggressive nature. There were rumors about having long guns and coming aggressively, that’s not true. The only aggression was on the FBI’s side in their response to us. We were initially told to go away. Exact words were get in your cars, go away, and don’t come back (0:04:34.1). The FBI and those agencies need to understand that we’re not just going to go away, not anymore. People have been doing that for years. I personally told the FBI agent out front, we’re not going to go away, we are here, we demand that you listen to us, cause times are changing. And they did. (0:04:54.9)

JVT: Wow. I want to get a copy of that video if possible so we can include it here.

BC: Absolutely

JVT: You then went to the county buildings and did the same thing with the sheriff, right? Tell us about that.

BC: That interaction was much more pleasant at first. Don’t get me wrong, the interaction with the FBI ended well. (0:05:14.5)

JVT: From my understanding, after 10 minutes of talking with these guys, the posture changed. It calmed down.

BC: Correct. One thing we addressed with them is the lack of transparency on their part. Their act of aggression with us, the way they come out in a forceful manner is the problem. That’s the perception they’re putting out there. That’s the disconnect between them and the people. They’re here to work for the people, by the people, for the people, and they need to remember that.
## I think this is a variation on quoting Lincoln
BC: (0:05:40.7) We needed to remind them that. That was a deliberate reason we did that, because we wanted to let them know that they need to enter a dialogue with the public. That maneuver was historical, it’s never been done. That’s what needs to be done, but in the right manner. I think we did it very professionally, in such a way that it was able to open that dialogue. After that, we went directly to the sheriff’s office where we engaged with the deputies. (0:06:10.7) They were welcoming, thanked us for stopping by, engaged with us, they talked with us to pass the time until the sheriff got back, for about an hour and a half. He came from home to come talk to us. It took him an hour and a half to get down there. So while we waited we talked with the deputies, talked about family and work and businesses and children.

JVT: During your patrols, I’ve noticed you give food and coffee, you try to open up lines of communication and humanize each side.

BC: (0:06:43.8) There’s been a lot of demonization tactics through social media and the mainstream media. We’re trying to remove that stigma.

JVT: That’s on both sides, the police are feeling that too. They’re being demonized just as much as we are.

BC: Absolutely. So we want to remove that. (0:06:57.6) The reality is we’re here, they’re here. The fact is we’re all people, we’re all citizens of this country. My personal belief is that a lot of things, a lot of conflict, can be avoided if people come together and communicate.

JVT: We’re still at a position where the Citizens for Constitutional Freedom are at the refuge. They’re not talking about coming out any time soon. We do have evidence that may be a game changer with the case with the Hammonds. How do you think this is going to play out? What are the possible scenarios moving forward?

BC: (0:07:39.8) One of our demands to the FBI is to investigate the prosecution and misconduct that took place. An eyewitness came forward that was interviewed by the prosecution side and was completely disregarded and not divulged to the defense. This witness, this testimony has the ability to exonerate the Hammonds.

JVT: You have audio of this witness, correct?

BC: We have audio.

JVT: I’ll be linking to that. I’d like to get a video of that if we can, I can change voices, I can blur faces. I’m hoping I can talk to him before I leave. (0:08:30.2) Do you think that if they uncover that these allegations of misconduct by the prosecution are true, will that be grounds for releasing the Hammonds? And if so, do you think that will be the impetus for this to end peacefully, to get the Citizens for Constitutional Freedom out of the refuge?

BC: The reason they’re up there is two-fold. The Hammonds’ case is one. They also want to have the federal-held lands, which are held in an unconstitutional manner, be returned back to the citizens of Harney County. That’s what they’re driving for, it’s a two-fold situation. They want to return the land, because it wasn’t properly ceded as required by the Constitution. The refuge is not another needful government building, which the Constitution is very clear about. That property should be returned to the citizens of Harney County.

JVT: Do you think it still could go sideways?

BC: (0:09:34.5) As long as both sides move forward in the way they’ve been doing, and they do so in a peaceful manner, where they’re gonna open up dialogue and have discussions. I know Ammon as a friend, I also know a lot of those guys up there. They want nothing more than for it to end peacefully. As long as the FBI maintains that same mindset, I have no doubt it will end peacefully. The only act of aggression that will take place is if it’s initiated by the FBI.

JVT: We don’t want to divulge OpSec. But I think they’re thinking twice about their initial plans now that you’ve made your presence known. It’s an unknown that now they have to factor into their equation (0:10:18.4). The best situation that could have come out of it did, so I want to commend you on your work. Let’s finish off, tell us about the structure of III%, and the background of it. For people who may not know, we in the Patriot movement know quite a bit. What would you tell them about it?

BC: III% is not a militia. It’s an ideology from the history of the Revolutionary War, where 3% of the armed citizens took up arms, also known as Minutemen, to fight against the tyranny of the king, for their colonies. So 3% is a historical term. We use that III% of Idaho as our organizational name because we believe that at least 3%, and I believe that number is growing, when it comes time to do like what we’re doing here in Burns, that they’re gonna come help.

JVT: (0:11:31.3) We’ve had victories from Bundy Ranch on, each time it seems like we’re adding a little bit with how we’re reacting. I think we’re about to enter a dynamic period of time where we’re seeing tremendous growth and acceptance of these types of groups, whether it’s the Pacific Patriots Network, III%, the Constitutional Guard, OK, I think people are beginning to change their thinking. What are your thoughts?

BC: They are. The more these things take place, it causes people to ask questions. That’s the goal. Let’s ask the question why are these things going on. As people ask those questions, they start to research. Any reasonable person can see that there’s a problem in this country. (0:12:14.3) They want to get plugged in. The Patriot Movement is growing at an exponential rate right now, as it ever has in history. It’s going to continue going that way as long as things keep going the way they’re going in this country. The government needs to be run by the people once again.

JVT: Anything you want to add?

BC: The only thing I want to add is that there’s a lot of disinformation about why we’re here or the situation here. People have the responsibility to check their facts and spread facts rather than rumors.

JVT: Where can they go to get direct information from your group, from PPN, from the Citizens for Constitutional Freedom?

BC: All of us have websites. PacificPatriotNetwork.com, iiipercentidaho.org. We try to keep posting updated information. As well as all of our organizational Facebook pages. Facebook is the quickest place we get things out from out here, as far as updates from the field.

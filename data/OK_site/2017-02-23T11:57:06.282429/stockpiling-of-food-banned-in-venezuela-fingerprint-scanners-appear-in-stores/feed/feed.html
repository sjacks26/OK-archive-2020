<content:encoded>An Executive Order from Barack Obama this week saw further sanctions applied to some Venezuelan citizens including freezing their assets in the United States and the prevention of United States’ businesses trading with them. The reasoning behind the sanctions, according to Obama is the “unusual and extraordinary threat” that Venezuela poses to the security and foreign policy of the United States.
<p>Balderdash! I don’t care for the leadership in Venezuela, but until Venezuelan Marines storm our shores and Venezuelan paratroopers land in our fields, they are no threat to us. Wrecking their economy with sanctions simply increases the illegal invaders to our SW border. Ought to be a law that re-instates the draft strictly for the progeny/nephews and nieces for our so-called leadership in Washington, District of Criminals. Such a draft would curb their globo-cop ambitions.</p>

<content:encoded>I find the White House statement to be ridiculous,  we could make those charges against them also, pitting the IRS against the Tea Party, calling all Veterans, Conservatives and Christians Domestic terrorists, journalists dying in freak accidents while writing exposes of Government corruption, controlled Leftist media, the use of Free Speech Zones, massive unwarranted searches of home &amp; cars while looking for one suspect, the Socialization of healthcare and schools, laws violating our Rights, false flag events, inciting racial division, a 16 year old held in indefinite detention with no charges, another American 16 year old boy killed by drone innocent of wrong doing,  extreme corruption in high Government offices, and the use of pepper spray, rubber bullets and noise cannons on peaceful protesters. They are no different than the Venezuelans.

<content:encoded>More inspiration to get my Hugel beds started!<br/>
“We will establish 20,000 fingerprint readers throughout the socialist system to guarantee the people their food.”- Methinks nanny-state will fail in the distribution, or use it against dissidents like Stalin did to the Kulaks during the Holodomor.

JVT: Another important story out of Texas. Rancher whose family has been on their land since early 1900s. Difference between this story and Bundys, Lavoy, and other ranchers is these guys own this land straight out. The deed has been passed down through the family. They’ve got a large amount of land, and they’re looking at taking half of it. We’re gonna be bringing more information here. We had a chance to sit down and talk with Ken (0:01:08.4) and had him lay out what’s happening. We’ve heard rumors that the governor may step up and do the right thing here. He’s sent some letters along with the AG to the BLM. He’s been quoted saying he’s going to out and plant a molon labe, a come and take it flag there in Red River. It’s not just Ken and his family, it’s affecting a 100+ mile stretch of land (0:01:41.0) all across the Red River. It’s a whole community being affected. Ken’s case is egregious because it’s the family home. They’re just gonna take it, they’re saying the state of Texas never should have issued the deed. (0:02:07.9) There are some real questions on the legality of what the BLM is doing. Here is my interview with Ken, Stewart Rhodes jumps in towards the end. Check back. We’ll be giving updates on this situation, we’re ready to go if he needs some protection or a QRF. No standup right now, just opening a dialogue with the ranchers in the area. Hopefully we can resolve this without a standup, a call-to. (0:03:03.0)

JVT: Ken, tell us about yourself and what’s going on.

KA: I farm and ranch down here along the Red River. Run cattle, hay, a little bit of cotton some years. Make a living off the land.

JVT: How long has your family been on this land? 

KA: (0:03:45.2) Grandfather bought this property in 1941.

JVT: You own it outright, is that correct?

KA: Yes. I own it. We’ve ranched this area, my grandfather to my father to me.

JVT: You’ve been living the American dream there (0:04:51.5).

KA: Yeah, this is what I’ve always wanted to do. It’s difficult, but it’s a good life. (0:05:00.2)

JVT: Tell us about the interaction with the BLM. How did that begin?

KA: It began in Christmas 2013. Local gang wardens called a lot of us along the river and told us the BLM was having a meeting we needed to go to. BLM claimed they owned property along the river. At the meeting, they set up a scoping period that has another week or two, on the public’s input on what to do with this property along the river. They had marked in red what they were claiming (0:05:57.6). I thought they were just exaggerating it on the map to make their point, I didn’t realize they were actually claiming all that land. They were claiming it. They moved the boundary within that department from the edge of the river to the high bluff. That’s the way it started, at a meeting in Witchita Falls.

JVT: (0:06:31.6) BLM is generally in charge of managing public land. This is private land though, your land. What authority are they claiming to do this?

KA: (0:06:43.2) Unfortunately, I don’t have a good answer for that. The people we meet with are just field workers. They aren’t giving us the defined boundary, they say different things, they’re not sure until they get it surveyed. But they’re moving the boundary south of the Red River, 300-400 yards, up to 2.5 miles. Unless the property has been surveyed, they won’t give a definite answer on where the boundary is. They also won’t say who made the decision to move the boundary, they just claim they don’t know.

JVT: (0:07:45.0) I read the BLM has told you that the deed to your property never should have been issued. Is that true?

KA: That’s correct.

JVT: What’s their precedent in saying that?

KA: (0:07:56.8) They said Texas has no legal standing to provide a deed for that property, that this has been BLM property since the Louisiana Purchase. 

JVT: The BLM wasn’t an entity at that point, was it?

KA: No. Well, they say it’s government land since the Louisiana Purchase. They claim that Texas or property owners never had the legal right to this property (0:08:29.3) and they’re just now coming to figure out how they’re going to manage it.

JVT: This is not just affecting you, right? There are other families, other land owners?

KA: That’s correct, for 116 miles along this river.

JVT: (0:08:48.4) How many families do you personally know that are being affected by this?

KA: I don’t know. It’s a long ways. There’s a lot of people I don’t even know. I know of, just my neighbors, 25-30.

JVT: (0:09:15.4) You may be losing your home. Tell us about that, why they decided that home was going to be their property.

KA: (0:09:38.5) I was on the phone with Mr. Larry Labesk (sp?). We had to have our input put in by Feb 3 after that first meeting. I called him on the 28th, told him about the deeded property and what we’ve been doing here. He said none of that mattered, we’re going to the hard tree line on the high bluff. I was standing outside my home while I was talking to him, and I said my home will be included in that. He said well you may have a problem. You need to write that down, that your home could be involved, and be sure to send it in to the BLM.

JVT: (0:10:46.6) Wow. If this were to go through, how would it change life for you and your family?

KA: It would be a big deal. I don’t know what we would do, I haven’t thought a lot about that yet. I don’t know. We’d have to locate elsewhere, build a new home. It would be a hard blow. It’s be kind of like a natural disaster, an earthquake just coming and blowing everything away, and then you lose the land too. (0:11:30.0)

JVT: Did this take you by surprise? Did you know this kind of thing was going on in our country, in your area there?

KA: (0:11:39.4) I did not. I’ve seen the news and heard that our government does things that are questionable at times, getting a bit too big. But I never thought anything like this could happen on deeded property, that’s been paid tax on since 1941. I never would have thought anything like this could actually happen.

JVT: (0:12:06.0) Now the governor has put out some letters with the AG to the BLM, that seem to be brushed off by the BLM. How has the interaction been with the local representatives, the governor to your state reps? Have they been supportive?

KA: (0:12:30.1) The governor had a rally when he was running for governor and said he would not let this happen. Haven’t heard a lot from him since then until yesterday morning. They said he had a press release yesterday talking about this, I have not seen it. Our congressman, Thornberry, has a bill trying to get through the House trying to clarify the boundary dispute, he’s trying to fix it through legislation. I hear it’s gonna have a tough time getting through, could take 1-2 years to come up for a vote, through the Senate, they’re making some changes. (0:13:28.2) Went to Washington in May of 2014, visited with Thornberry, he said he was gonna get right on this bill, which he did. It took a while to get it written, but it hasn’t come up for a vote yet. It’s just recently made it through the subcommittee.

JVT: (0:13:52.7) Has the BLM given you a timeline as to when they might start taking action, claiming your property? Is it feasible that legislation will get passed in time to help you personally?

KA: (0:14:04.8) Doubtful. The last meeting we had 10 days ago in Fort Worth, their scoping period ends in about a week. Then they’re going to analyze the public input and figure out how they’re going to manage this property. That decision is supposed to be made by summer of next year. Once they make that decision, they’ll start going forward sometime after next summer.

JVT: (0:14:48.5) How has the response been from your neighbors, your community? Are they willing to stand with you? Are you looking to fight this? What is your plan right now?

KA: (0:14:59.2) I don’t think we’re gonna let this happen. A lot of people are like me, they’re just a little bit shocked by this. I think as long as the talking is going on, everybody’s not real concerned. It’s gonna change if they actually come on our property. That’s when we’ll be in a new ballgame.

SR: (0:15:31.5) You said they are now telling you they’re gonna go to the bluff. Prior to this, they didn’t do that in their claimed control. What was the boundary before?

KA: (0:15:53.6) It was the gradient boundary along the Red River. That’s normally where the vegetation line is.

SR: Explain what that means.

KA: The bank that holds the river in place. The Red River is prone to flooding, and it moves around a little bit. It’s real sandy right here (0:16:25.4). It doesn’t erode quite as much in other places. It’s just a bank that holds the river on its natural course. Usually just a few feet from there is normally the vegetation line.

SR: (0:16:45.2) That’s where they claimed control, just up to the end of the bank, where the bushes began, right?

KA: Yes. They own from their north to the middle of the channel. So it was just a slither of land on the southern bank of the river.

SR: A couple feet.

KA: Usually. Sometimes it may be as much as 50 feet, depending. In some places, the river is narrow and deep, in some places it’s wide and narrow. If the river’s 100 yards wide, they get from there to the edge of the bank.

SR: (0:17:33.5) Now they’re saying, rather than 50 feet at the most, they’re gonna go beyond the beginning of the vegetation, up to the top of the bluff.

KA: That’s what Labesk told me. Some others told me they’re going to the bottom of the high bluff. So I don’t know if they know. They’ll claim they don’t know exactly. They say they aren’t the surveyors, this is just the general idea. They dispute themselves a little. I don’t know that they’re being dishonest, I just think they don’t know. 

SR: (0:18:20.4) What’s their explanation for this change?

KA: Well they’ve redefined the gradient boundary. They’re saying the gradient boundary now is the high bluff. 

SR: But that’s something they’ve never done before.

KA: No. (0:18:41.5) The surveyors said that’s not what they intended when this 1923 survey took place. They were talking about the bank that holds the river in its natural flow during flooding. 

SR: Now they’re saying the boundary is any land the river might touch, even during a flood. 

KA: (0:19:12.3) Yes, they’re going to the high line.

SR: On your land, that’s how many feet, from where it used to be to where they’re gonna go?

KA: (0:19:21.7) I would say a half of mile. 

SR: If that’s not a land grab, what is it? Their own rule they’ve been operating under was the common sense thing, just to the top of the bank of the actual river. Now they’re saying, we redefine that term to now mean the top of the bluff. Cause the river might, is the river ever gonna get to the top of the bluff during a flood?

KA: (0:19:55.6) It never has.

SR: But they’re using that as their new rule. They’re making their own rules. It’d be like if I was next to you on a piece of property, and I said no the property line is on the other side of your house because I say so. That’s pretty much what they’re doing.

KA: I’ve asked these field workers how that happened, how it got changed. They have absolutely no comment. (0:20:23.5)

SR: I read that the plan is to put in bike trails and nature walks and a bunch of stuff like that. Is that correct?

KA: Yes. And bird watching, open up to the Boys and Girls Club. They have a whole realm of things in their scope they could do. Whatever is best for the public. (0:20:52.5)

## KA and SR talk over each other until (0:20:57.8)

SR: But this is your property, private land.

KA: I consider this my property. I’ve got a deed to it.

SR: Up until now, everyone considered it your property. Just the BLM now is saying it’s not, making their own rules for themselves. (0:21:14.4)

KA: Correct.

SR: Mr. Henderson, one of the other ranchers who had a dispute in the past, his story is a little different. His was a dispute between him and an Oklahoma private land owner, cause the river has shifted. The Oklahoma land owner claimed it now belonged to him. Can you explain that? (0:21:35.6)

KA: We had a flood in the 70s, the river got up and changed courses completely. It cut Mr. Henderson’s property in half. The land, his property on the north side of the river, the Oklahoma rancher started taking possession of it. They got into a court battle, Henderson didn’t have any money to fight, to hire attorneys. That judge deemed it BLM property, said I’m tired of y’all fighting. That happened in I think 1980.

SR: (0:22:17.5) That was a Texas state judge?

KA: I’m not sure if it was a Texas state or an Oklahoma. I think it was Texas, but I’m not sure.

SR: (0:22:31.0) But that’s different. That’s a dispute between two private land owners. But what’s interesting about that is the judge ruled its federal land. How many acres was taken from him and given to the feds?

KA: (0:22:48.2) I believe it was around 140. He owed money on that property, and he had to keep making payments on it. I’m not kidding.

SR: Does that relate to this? Are they taking that as their precedent? Are they making arguments like that?

KA: (0:23:29.3) I think it has something to do with it. It gave them an idea, what this judge declared. I think they decided to try to go the whole 116 miles with it. They use it as a landmark decision.

SR: (0:23:50.2) So the judge went to the bluff? Is that what he did?

KA: Yep.

SR: Okay, so that’s their precedent. They didn’t use it for 30 years, but now all of the sudden they’re gonna use it, all the way to the bluff. (0:24:12.7) Well I guess one big question is what does your sheriff say about this? Is he making any indication that he’s willing to stand up and defend your property rights?

KA: No, not really. Our county judge has been to some meetings, our commissioner. I think right now, everyone is hoping this gets worked out legally. Maybe it will, I don’t know.

SR: (0:24:43.6) You mean you’re hoping that your Congressman can get legislation passed to protect the land that you’ve owned.

KA: Yes. That’s where our elected officials are right now. They’re hoping this gets worked out through legislation. (0:25:06.4).

SR: Now what about a legal fight? You said some landowners have hired an attorney?

KA: (0:25:12.1) They are going in that direction. I don’t know if they’ve hired attorneys yet.

SR: It doesn’t hurt to fight in every kind of court. Court of public opinion is pretty important, also. This is the problem we see across the country, this chipping away at private property rights, whether the land outright or the use of the land, what you can and can’t do on your own land. (0:25:49.9) How do your neighbors feel about being united and standing up? Are they united?

KA: Right now, my neighbors are like our elected officials. They’re just hoping it gets worked out through them. The ones I’ve talked to have said that once they start coming onto our property, trying to make managing decision or surveying or send the EPA or endangered people out, that’s when it’s all going to change. They’re not gonna allow that to happen on their property.

SR: One day, they’re gonna come, men with guns, to evict you and your wife and kids (0:26:35.8), from your house. That’s where this is leading. That’s why, where’s the sheriff, where’s the governor? These are the people who are supposed to be standing up for you. This was originally Texas land, right? Then your family was deeded this land from Texas.

KA: Yes (0:26:57.0) And I’ve been to our courthouse looking at records. I can take this property back to 1907, after that I’ve got to do more investigating, they had a fire at the courthouse back in that era. The records before that are in a different place, I’ve gotta go look for it. Don’t know if I can find it or not.

SR: So you’ve got clear title to 1907, from the state of Texas. Before that, it was private land owners. 

KA: Yes (0:27:41.1)

SR: When Texas was a republic, it obviously owned the land. When it joined the Union, it owned the land. That’s even stronger than the status of other states. This was not part of the Louisiana Purchase, was it? This was part of Mexico, wasn’t it? 
KA: Yes

SR: So it became Texas after the rebellion against Santa Anna. You were your own country. Then you joined the Union by your own choice.

KA: Correct.

SR: That was your land, was part of that whole process.

KA: Yes

SR: (0:28:21.5) This was never disputed between Texas and Oklahoma.

KA: No, never had any problems in this area between Texas and Oklahoma.

SR: So it’s a little bit different than Mr. Henderson’s

KA: Right. This property where I am, the river has taken over hundreds of my acres. When I was a kid, the river was way over on the north side. My grandfather ran several hundred cows down there. The river, as flooding occurred, it would change course. Through the years, it built up the north side of the valley a little higher with sand and silt, since 1985 the river has been steadily coming south. (0:29:19.9) We had a lot of rain in May and June this year, and I lost about 70 acres to the river. That’s nature, that’s just the way it is. 

SR: You can deal with that.

KA: I can deal with that.

SR: What you can’t deal with is (0:29:37.6) arbitrary bureaucrats changes their own rules, taking advantage, to say we own not just this, we own all that including your house.

KA: Correct

SR: What do you want to see done about this? I know you had a rally last year. Was it Abbott who put that rally on as a candidate for governor? (0:30:02.4)

KA: I think it probably was. It was right after this info came out from the BLM, when they were beginning their scoping process. It was a big deal down in Clay County. They didn’t know where to go. Our local judges, it was an election time, it was a good rally, good publicity.

SR: I’m reading a quote from Abbott from last year, putting out a statement saying We have one message for the BLM, come and take it. Which is a reference to Texas history, right? 

KA: Correct

SR: Hardcore statement (0:31:01.5) that he’s not gonna let them do this, so now we need to see whether he’s gonna prove up, whether he’s gonna keep his election campaign promise and actually stand up for you and not let them take your land. What do you think is gonna happen? Do you think he’s got the cojones?

KA: I don’t know. I hope that he does. He hasn’t been talking about this situation much lately. I don’t know.

SR: Jason, didn’t we see a statement from the governor yesterday saying the same thing?

JVT: Yeah, a letter written by the governor and the state AG. 

SR: And it says molon labe in it?

JVT: There was a reference to the come and take it, yes. I will include those PDFs in the notes of this show. (0:32:07.9)

SR: If the governor is gonna make statements as a candidate and today, come and take it, that means we’re not gonna let you have it. He needs to mean that. These ranchers are gonna be relying on it. 

KA: Right. One problem I have, and my neighbors. (0:32:41.8) I’m not a politician, I’m not a big government like the BLM. We want this to be solved. We don’t want a standoff, where they leave and a year later it’s happening again. We would like to get this fixed so it doesn’t come up for my children or my grandchildren. We’ve learned, we’ve had some power lines come through us in recent years and we’ve been lied to. When I talked to Thornberry’s office and some of our politicians, our judges, the BLM is saying they’re going to work with our legislators to get this fixed (0:33:32.1). We want to get this fixed. They have told me personally, we want away from the Red River. We’re tired of it, it’s giving us a black eye.

SR: The field agents are saying that. (0:33:47.4)

KA: Correct. At the same time, though, they’re continuing to move forward. They’re still going through the process. I asked them why they’re still doing that and they say we’ve got to go through the process. It’s law. That’s the part we don’t like. If their process includes sending out the EPA or the endangered species or any other departments or agencies, we don’t want that happening.

SR: I’m looking at an article right now (0:34:30.2) that says the BLM is opposing the legislation by your congressman. So when it comes to the BLM itself, maybe the field agents want out of it, but the BLM has issued a statement saying they oppose the legislation to fix this. They don’t want to fix this, they want your land.

KA: Right. I would not disagree with that, you’re right. (0:34:55.6)

SR: I’m looking at this article, BLM opposes Thornberry bill to resolve Red River land dispute (0:35:04.1).

KA: I have not read that, that does not surprise me. If they wanted it fixed, they could fix it. If the people high up in the BLM who make decisions wanted this to go away, they could make it go away.

SR: They could just go back to the way they used to define the bank of the river. It was where the river stopped. That’s a no-brainer. That might shift, but you’re fine dealing with that, it’s an act of nature (0:35:34.7). They’ve decided on their own to create this dispute. 

KA: That’s correct. I’m fuzzy on this part, this is a complicated situation (0:35:48.6). I have talked to some surveyors who say that this was not what the survey intended, that BLM is interpreting it completely wrong. I’ve got some of the surveyors names that I could probably look up and give you if you want to talk to them. They’re very clear and confident that they’re right that BLM is wrong. 

SR: Here’s the statement I’m reading. (0:36:26.1) BLM objected Tuesday to Thornberry’s bill to remove federal claims along the Red River are [can’t make out these words]. Quote from Steve Ellis, BLM deputy director: the department shares the goal of legislation, but cannot support the bill as currently written, it could transfer public land without fully compensating tax payers. They’re claiming this land now belongs to them and this bill will deprive tax payers of their land (0:36:58.9).

KA: Wow. When was that article written?

SR: Published July 29, 2014. Oh, a year ago.

JVT: I’d like the names of those surveyors. Is there anything else people can do to support the legislation? Is there anything else you want to add to this? (0:37:38.6)

KA: No.

SR: This says Thornberry raised the point that people are still making payments on this land, how fair would it be to make payments on land you no longer control. (0:37:55.5) You’d be in the same position as Henderson, right, if you still owe money on the land, you’re still making payments to the prior land owner from land that’s been taken from you.

KA: That’s exactly correct (0:38:06.2). I do have a place in Witchita County that I bought in 2010. It had been in my family since the late 40s, it was my grandfather’s brother’s wife’s family. But we farmed and ranched this property until 2010. It got passed down to so many descendants they couldn’t keep up with it, they decided to sell it. They’re claiming 240 acres on that, the BLM, and I’m still making payments on that. (0:38:46.8) So that would be devastating. I’ve drilled water wells, put up a new fence, made lots of improvements. We have a clouded title now, you can’t sell the land, you can’t buy it, improvements have stopped. People normally put in grass, put up fences, tanks, water wells, a host of things you used to do and all that’s stopped now because they don’t know if they own the land or not.

SR: (0:39:20.0) Right. They don’t want to put the work in. Are they being told they cannot go out and work on it.

KA: You can. They have not told us that we can’t. But if you need to go borrow money for an improvement, they’re not gonna loan you money. (0:39:31.6)

SR: Well why would you want to do that anyway, put yourself in a loss. What’s the plan going forward, besides waiting on the congressman to hopefully get his bill passed? Are you thinking another rally? What’s your short-term plan?

KA: There is no short-term plan (0:39:51.3), other than some neighbors are planning now to talk to some attorneys. The attorneys have said this is a no-brainer, it’s not gonna be a big deal, they are wrong, they’re interpreting this wrong. We should not have any problems in court. So that’s probably the only short term plan. (0:40:19.8) Thornberry still has confidence in the bill, but it’s just gonna take years to get this done. 

SR: That’s who should take care of this. Congress has authority over the BLM and should put a stop to it (0:40:44.2). That’s ground zero. The governor has the responsibility to enforce the sovereignty of Texas. What they’re saying is that they’re taking this land because it never belonged to you, you never owned it, Texas never owned it. The history of Texas is pretty unique, it was its own country, I don’t know how they could claim that Texas never owned this land. You’ve got a problem on your hand if you’re one of these bureaucrats. And the governor’s gotta stand up. Maybe it would help to do another rally, I would encourage you and your neighbors to talk about that. (0:41:22.9) That puts pressure on the politicians, whether through the state, the governor and the legislature asserting their rights which is their duty, or the Congress too. Let us know if you need help with that, we will help you put one on, put the word out, get people there. You know Texans and people from other parts of the country will be willing to stand up. 

KA: I sure will and I appreciate it (0:41:57.9) and all you’ve done, what you’ve offered so far. It makes us sleep better at night.

SR: I appreciate that, but I think Texans need to stand up, that’s why I encourage you to do a rally. You need is, the governor has said molon labe, you need the Texas people to say come and take it, we’re not gonna let you have it. The stronger the resolve of the people, the stronger the resolve of the politicians. The politicians sometimes need support keeping their promises (0:42:36.3). 

KA: I agree with that. I just turned 50, I try to learn from past mistakes, I learned you just can’t rely on politicians when you really really need them. I’m not saying that’s the case here, just in the past, that’s the norm. Hopefully this situation will be different (0:43:01.7). I have a whole lot more confidence in myself, my neighbors, and an organization like yours than in politicians.

SR: Unfortunately, it’s a rare politician who’s a Sam Houston, let’s put it that way. We’ll see if Governor Abbott proves up and acts like one.

KA: Yeah, I guess we’ll see. (0:43:31.5)

SR: Thanks for talking to us. I’m gonna be in Texas. We’re doing a summit on the border December 6, we’ll be there anyway, talking about the border issue. We’re putting a call-up of Texas veterans to go down to the border and protect ranchers from cartels. While we’re at it, I think we’ll be discussing this issue too. Whether it’s cartels or the BLM, I don’t care who the bad guy is, if they’re running roughshod over Texans and taking their land, we’re gonna stand against them. We’ll put the invite out to you and other ranchers to come down and tell your story. It’s a gathering of Texas veterans (0:44:19.7). We’re gonna start with Texas veterans first, then branch it out to other parts of the country. 

KA: Okay. When is that?

SR: December 6th is the meeting in Dripping Springs, Texas. We’ll put a press release out there. Main point is to bring Texas veterans together, (0:44:43.1) it should never be a situation like down at the border where they’re being offered silver or lead, being run off their land by the cartels. You have to wonder where the hell are the Texas veterans. We’re gonna do a call-up, a retired Texas general Brown is gonna be issuing the call-up to stand up and defend their own sovereignty. They’re being invaded by the cartels. (0:45:12.0) We’ll discuss this issue too.

KA: I appreciate that, and all you’ve offered to do. Hopefully this situation will not escalate.

SR: If the politicians keep their promises, there will be no need for it to escalate. This is very different than Bundy situation in Nevada. This was always private land (0:45:46.5), this was never public land. It goes all the way back to 1907. This is far worse. That was bad enough, this is far far far worse. I think the logic is the navigable river, they claim control over all navigable rivers. If you can float a canoe down the creek next to your house, you can bet they’ll consider that navigable and they might do the same exact thing across the country, using this precedent here. (0:46:30.7) Don’t be surprised, you should expect it. We need to nip it in the bud so they don’t do it to everyone across the country.

KA: I agree with that. Water is a big issue down here with the drought we’ve been having, that and oil is what’s probably behind this. (0:46:56.7)

SR: Oil? How’s that work in?

KA: We don’t have any production on my end, but in Clay County there’s some production. These comments are being made to me by these BLM guys, it blows my mind, one 2 weeks ago, I told him I don’t want the EPA, he said we don’t have any plans to come into your county to do any of our surveying, I don’t know why we’d want to go up there anyway, there’s no oil production in your area. Now he said that, I don’t know whether he knew what he was talking about. (0:48:00.0)

SR: That’s surprising. Much like the miners in Oregon and Montana. It’s funny how the BLM always wants land that has mineral value or some kind of serious cash-flow value down the road. If you find out more of that, let us know.

KA: I will (0:48:21.5)

SR: Anything we can do for you right now?

KA: I don’t think so. You’ve done a lot. If anything else comes up, I’ll give you a shout.

SR: You’ve got support from folks across the country. People are starting to become aware that it’s not just innocent bureaucrats trying to do their job, it’s an agenda to take away the land of American people, strip them of their property rights. People are starting to become aware, and also tired of it. We understand that if we continue to let them do it, they’re never gonna stop (0:49:11.4). They’re gonna keep going until there’s no longer rural America, they’ll take all our land. 

KA: That’s right. That’s how they do it, just a little piece at a time. It’s good to visit with you guys. It’s giving me a lot of confidence. It’s easy to get down, to see all the corruption and hate going on in our country nowadays, all the bad things going on. It’s good that guys like you are out there willing to help and do your part. That makes me and my neighbors feel a lot better. It’s one thing to say it, you guys are actually standing up and doing things, that’s what makes this nation great.

SR: We’ll do what we can to help you. (0:50:13.4) We want to see Texans stand up. It’s critical that your neighbors stand up and be united. The more united you are, the better. Hopefully this gets resolved through legislation or the courts. But if you need people to stand up, I think you’ll get people. It should be Texans first and foremost. We’ll put this call-up out there with the veterans of Texas and put this on the table, make sure they know that if it comes down to it, they need to be there for you. We’ll make sure that happens. We’ll make sure you have a good roster of hardcore Texans if you need it.

KA: I appreciate it.

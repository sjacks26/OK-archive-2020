SR: You didn’t see that in New Orleans itself.

JM: No. They gathered together in bars to drink and forget what happened. Getting together to protect each other, New Orleans was a whole different animal. 

SR: One problem was they already had the mayor and police chief declare that they were going to confiscate the guns. That’s what the guys in the rural part heard.

JM: Not only that, there were videos on the internet of police going through the Walmarts taking stuff. They were supposed to protect you but they were taking stuff. Instead of telling you to get out of here. I don’t want to say they were all corrupt, but there wasn’t a good feeling in New Orleans like there was in the rural area. You got into the city and everyone was very, we don’t know what’s going on with the police force. They were more willing to talk to us than their own police force.

SR: Didn’t trust the cops?

JM: Didn’t trust them. Like you said, they already said we’re going to take your stuff, we’re taking your guns, we’re going to talk in without warrants and take everything you have if we have to.

SR: That bar owner, did you have a conversation later on about what he would have done if there had been gun confiscation?

JM: We had that the first night. (0:01:18.5) He said we knew you guys were coming, and I asked him what he meant, he said you’re here for my guns. I said no. He said good cause you wouldn’t get them anyway. No one is taking my guns, I don’t care if it’s you, the police, the President of the United States himself. No one’s getting the gun out of my hand unless I’m dead. You’re not taking it from me. I went okay.

SR: So it’s a darn good thing you showed up at his bar and not somebody who didn’t have your

JM: Definitely. He would have defended it. It’s not constitutional for people to come in and do that. 4A guarantees that we will not have illegal searches and seizures. You have to have proof that something illegal is going on to walk in, then that warrant can’t say go look around, you have to have specifics. You’re looking for a fully automatic weapon, if it’s illegal in that town, you’re looking for drugs. You have to say what you’re looking for, you can’t just say I’m going in to look for this.

SR: (0:02:15.3) We were talking a minute ago about what’s going on in Chicago right now. We’ve got 2 state legislators calling for martial law, calling for the National Guard to come in. You already had a discussion among your guys about that, right?

JM: When that came through on the news. Guys came to me, because I’m outspoken, I always have an opinion. They wanted to know my opinion. I said they better not call us up cause I won’t go. That was actually declaring martial law and taking them. And the problem I have with the government coming in and saying we’re declaring martial law and taking weapons, who do they get them from? The law abiding citizens who aren’t using them for crime. Cause the criminals aren’t going to say, okay martial law here’s my AK. They won’t do that. They don’t respect the law, that’s why they’re criminals. All you’re doing is taking law abiding citizens’ ability to defend themselves from those criminals away. The law abiding citizen isn’t shooting at cops or National Guardsmembers trying to deliver aid. They’re helping, just like they were in Erath. They were feeding us, offering us blankets, pillows.

SR: You had a 4 man element doing patrol right?

JM: Yes

SR: If you’d have been attacked by looters, gotten into a firefight with them, the guys on the lawn protecting their neighborhood, would have come to your aid, right?

JM: (0:04:05.1) I didn’t tell you this before. That kind of happened. We had a bunch of teenage kids out just before curfew. Their favorite thing to do was make the MRE bottle, you take the heating element from an MRE, put it in a plastic bottle, put a little water in it, it’s kind of like a dry ice bomb. They’re favorite thing to do was toss those into the Humvee, to watch the soldiers duck and cover. They thought that was funny. That happened one night and down the block was the group of guys. The car happened to turn towards the group of guys. They threw it while we were talking to a police officer. We were inside and it went boom, looked around, saw a car go down the road, jumped in the Humvee, we weren’t going to catch them. By the time we did catch them, these guys had them out on the lawn, with their cell phones out calling their parents saying why are your kids out this close to curfew messing with the National Guard.

SR: So they were watching your back already. (0:05:10.2)

JM: The parents of those kids came by the next day and apologized to the day shift, said it will never happen again. If you see that car or my kids, here’s my cell phone. call me.

SR: Those are dumb kids.

JM: Really dumb. But they saw what happened and they took it. When we rolled up, it wasn’t like they had them at gunpoint. They stopped them, told them get your little tails out of the car, and sit on the sidewalk, we’re calling your parents. When we pulled up, three guys were on the phone. We left before parents got there, which was probably a good thing because the guys were like oh you’re going to get it now, your dad is mad. We left before it happened, so I don’t know what happened. But we did see the kids out playing basketball a few nights later before curfew.

SR: So they survived punishment

JM: Yeah, they were out playing ball. When we drove by, they went hey guys sorry. And we drove away. A couple days later, we shot hoops with them before we did stuff. They were apologetic. They were just kids. But the neighborhood watch guys were right there, and they were on our side.

SR: And they knew the kids, knew who the parents were?

JM: It’s a small town (0:06:30.3). You can throw a rock from one end of the town to the other.

SR: The obvious point is, the folks who live there are best able to take care of stuff.

JM: Yea

SR: Not bringing in police officers from all over the country who don’t know the locals. That’s a problem.

JM: The town borders were actually fairly large, but it was a lot of farmland. The police officer, the one on shift, was doing his patrols, he was doing mostly the farmlands because he knew the back roads and stuff where people could hide. We stayed in the middle of town, which was 3 miles long and just under 2 miles wide. It had a highway and a railroad running through the middle, and 5 or 6 blocks on either side. We took care of that, cause he was always out. Imagine if that was a real serious crime, and he’s out patrolling. Who’s going to protect that family? The dad who’s there with his shotgun is going to protect that family. If someone comes up from, a nearby town had a big gang problem. If those guys trickle down into Erath. It was a 20 minute drive.

SR: That was a concern for all the guys who got together?

JM: That’s why they were there. That’s who was coming down and stealing refrigerators and breaking into houses, looking for computers, was the little gang members. That’s why they did it. The concern I would have if I lived there is this isn’t just during Katrina and Rita, what happens if that’s a constant thing? We’ve scouted this out, we know this guy’s a farmer and has a great big truck, that would sell good on the black market. Let’s go get it. Who’s going to defend it? That one cop who’s out in the middle of nowhere? No. That’s why I’m a big protector of 2A.

SR: Here in Utah, same kind of deal, right?

JM: Oh yeah

SR: Out in rural Utah, isolated farms and stuff

JM: Not just rural Utah. I didn’t tell you, I don’t live here in rural Utah my whole life, I’ve only been here 3 years. I lived in West Valley, which is very urban. I had a gun pulled on me in my own yard. It took 2.5 hours for the cops to get there from the police station a quarter mile away. My wife went in and called 911, I went back in the house shaking because I was nervous. I had my hunting shotgun in the house, that was it. But I was in my front yard and they were doing some stuff, I asked what they were doing and had a gun in my face. 2.5 hours later.

SR: Were they gang members?

JM: Yeah. We found out as we lived there, we ended up moving from that house because it was bad. They had stolen cars that were parked in front of my house. It took a little while, this was when my wife and I were first married. She was very anti-gun. I had to keep my hunting rifles and stuff at my dad’s house, all I had was my shotgun that I had to have locked up. She was anti-gun. It took about 3 times of these gang members coming by and flashing their gun at me before she said that’s it we’re getting a handgun. I loaded her in the car, took her right to the store, and said which one do you like. I was out doing yard work a few weeks later. I know that I shouldn’t brandish a firearm, but I just wanted to show them I wasn’t scared. They said yea you still scared and brandished theirs, and I said no cause I can shoot and brandished mine. Never had a problem again. They stayed away from my house.

SR: Imagine that.

JM: They didn’t come kick my fence when my dogs were barking. They were walking on the other side of the street when they had to pass.

SR: They were tough guys when you were unarmed. Even playing field, it’s different.

JM: Now that you level the playing field, it could have been 6 of them carrying. But because I’m carrying myself, they won’t do anything.

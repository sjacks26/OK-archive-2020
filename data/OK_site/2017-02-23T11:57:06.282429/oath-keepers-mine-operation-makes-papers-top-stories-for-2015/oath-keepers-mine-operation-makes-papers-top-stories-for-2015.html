<p>The Oath Keepers’ presence at the White Hope Mine through “Operation Big Sky” has been named the <strong><a href="http://helenair.com/news/local/top-stories-of-oath-keepers-stage-operation-in-lincoln-amid/article_dc403c5a-a278-5654-8d92-4df17679642a.html" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://helenair.com/news/local/top-stories-of-oath-keepers-stage-operation-in-lincoln-amid/article_dc403c5a-a278-5654-8d92-4df17679642a.html', 'number six story of the year');" target="_blank">number six story of the year</a></strong> by the Helena Independent Record.</p>
<p>“The Oath Keepers came to Lincoln at the request of White Hope Mine owners Phil Nappo and George Kornec,” the feature story notes. “The miners claimed harassment by federal officials and that the mining claim east of town predated a 1955 law granting surface rights to the Forest Service.”</p>
<p>Two things stand out for those with an eye for such things: The first is the blatant and tyrannical unfairness of supposedly-unaccountable BLM bureaucrats and DOJ attorneys, with their focus on usurping power and dictating to citizens (the ones they’re not outright destroying) what they can and cannot do. In the case of the White Hope Mine, the ‘technicality” appears to be Komec is accused of missing a filing deadline—even though required paperwork was notarized and filed on time. The Post Office didn’t postmark it until the next day, and for that, the full force and unlimited resources of the feds are being brought down on men who put years of their lives into working a claim that was now being “officially” stolen.</p>
<p>Compare that to the Preamble to the Constitution, for the purposes of this story focusing on one key mandate:</p>
<blockquote><p>We the People of the United States, in Order to … secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America.</p></blockquote>
<p>Everyone involved in trying to steal that claim is a willing part of the rule-by-diktat apparatus, betraying the whole reason we have this government in the first place.</p>
<p>The second thing that stands out is a familiar smear leveled against Oath Keepers all the time by Opposite Day “progressives,” that is, by subversives and domestic enemies.</p>
<p>“The Montana Human Rights Network had a different opinion, saying that the Oath Keepers are part of a fringe, anti-government ‘patriot’ movement,” the report related.</p>
<p>What an Orwellian “War is Peace, Freedom is Slavery, Ignorance is Strength” name for creatures of the totalitarian lobby, siding with the government and against the people. It’s no wonder they try to portray a group that stands for defending the Constitution as “anti-government.”</p>
<p>Back in August, I noted “<strong><a href="../oath-keepers-must-be-force-multipliers-to-ensure-truth-is-shared/index.html" target="_blank">Oath Keepers Must Be Force Multipliers to Ensure Truth is Shared</a></strong>.” Right now, even though the mine protection operations recap story has been out for two days, readers in the area who only know about it through what they see in the Independent Record could benefit from an overview of who Oath Keepers are and what the organization is about.  And curiously, right now, there are “0 comments” under that report.</p>
<p>Why not be a force multiplier and help spread the truth about Oath Keepers to a readership that might not otherwise learn of it?  If enough of you do, it might even have the side benefit of showing the paper they were really reporting on the number one story of 2015. [UPDATE: Several of us have tried unsuccessfully to add comments there.  That being the case, please be a force multiplier by sharing the truth in other ways, via emails, forums, blogs and social media.]

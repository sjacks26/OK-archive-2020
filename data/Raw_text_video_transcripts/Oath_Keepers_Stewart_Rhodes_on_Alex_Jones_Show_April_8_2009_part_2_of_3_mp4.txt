## Alex Jones; Stewart Rhodes

Stewart Rhodes: [00:00:00] It's it was really close right. But first the smear campaigns there they are. 

Alex Jones: [00:00:04] They've had to down the track so is Raw Story so is the Pittsburgh Post Gazette. But the New York Times is refusing. And now AlterNet and also George Soros's Web site is attacking us. That's Media Matters. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:00:18] You know one of the Daily Kos writers in another comment thread on their site was talking about if these gun owners, if they think they're going to be able to defeat the US, you know and the U.S. government. We've got news for them, we're going that we're going to, actually he talked about and bragged about being able to call in air strikes and use artillery fire and flatten their homes and kill or kill their wives and children. 

Alex Jones: [00:00:40] They love it. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:00:41] Of the regular writers. And so that's what you know it is reaffirmed for me that we're on the right track. Our mission is to not. 

Alex Jones: [00:00:47] Who is this enemy of the republic. We'll do a story on him. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:00:52] Look his name up. I'll e-mail it up. 

Alex Jones: [00:00:54] Yeah look it up during the break I want because I want to go after these people I mean they love power. They're now bragging that they funded Pol Pot. Brzezinski is again in a headline on Google I want to show that. German government says U.S. government funded Pol Pot. Well we already know that because Brzezinski bragged that they have documents in Europe. Well they don't need to he he's writing articles about himself he's very proud of it. But the issue is these are sickos man. They like Stalin. They like what Mao did and they think we're going to roll over and turn our guns into them. I mean and they're trying to get the cops to march against us. It isn't going to happen is it. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:01:31] No it's not. That's exactly right. And this just pisses off. The more they talk like that the more angry we get and the more resolved we are to make sure that they have nothing. They have no power over us. And so that's that's that's our job is to not buy into their propaganda and their assumption that they have got. 

Alex Jones: [00:01:48] So you've got this guy this phony leftist quote pacifist bragging about all the power they've got now through the military and how they'll bomb our home sick. Well no they support the Iraq war. Now they support the carnage because they're good liberals. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:02:04] Yeah in fact this is the same writer during the Bush administration was talking about how terrible it is to have civilian casualties. And then but now he turns around and says we're going to we're going to show you we're going to call in airstrikes on you. I'm looking for a link right now. 

Alex Jones: [00:02:21] They want war. They look these these globalists, these socialists, they socialize our wealth, these controllers. They want a Russian revolution here folks. It's the same crew and I'm here to tell you right now, Ladies and gentlemen, that they intend to march the military and the police against the American people. they've always hated you they've always had your freedom. they want to loot the middle class and give it all to George Soros who says he loves the crisis. He engineered the crisis. He's having the time of his life. Fact where is that headline. Here it is. This is a press conference so it's you Google George Soros having a great crisis you'll get hundreds of articles. Zoom in on this guy show them. I'm having a very good crisis Soros says. hedge fund manager makes billions off recession. He says it's very stimulating and the culmination of his life's work, it's his life's work to do this. He brags on TV how they cut the oil prices to bankrupt the economy worse. This guy is sick is he not. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:03:20] Absolutely. I found out his name his name is Marcion it goes by the name Marcion on the Daily Kos and he writes all kinds articles for them. 

Alex Jones: [00:03:28] And what's in the article where he says he wants to use the military to shell women and children. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:03:33] It's an article about that article. It's called a letter from a militia man with poll which was posted by J.C. WILLMORE. And what he had done is that a gentleman named Michael Vandenberg who was involved in the militia movement back in the 80s

## I think Rhodes is referring to Vanderboegh here. See below. 

Stewart Rhodes:  that written him a response to his post about about claiming that the GOP was responsible for the militia and was with inciting violence and things like that. And so he wrote him a letter saying look the GOP as far as we're concerned as is morally bankrupt and is an empty shell. Your real problem is with the people of the United States. This Vanderboegh wrote. And so this guy posted his letter on Daily Kos, saying look at this whacko militia who just wrote me. Then started talking about you know how we're going to stop these people and what we're going to do to the gun owners. That's the discussion thread that this guy this guy. 

Alex Jones: [00:04:29] I want Kurt and Emmo to do a report on this outrageous. Now here's the deal. We've confirmed that one of the big shows on Air America on in major cities, is saying I'm calling for violence and that I told the shooter to kill the cops when it turns out that the white supremacist was attacking me. Now that's incredible libel, slander, defamation. OK. Now now now that's going on. We're here explaining the globalist have to have a breakdown of society and civil war to get away with the theft because they need the US to fall now that they've stolen the GDP in six months. It's already done you can't fix it it's so bad. You know we we're going to go into a depression, it's going to be horrible. But they intend to keep piling on the tyranny. They want to have a war. They want to have a conflict. And then they've got the nerve to say that we're behind this and we're doing this and then they're bragging about how they want to use military against the American people. My my God. I mean do they have any idea how hellish This is going to be this starts up there. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:05:28] He says he says if these gun nuts that think they can take the field against one of the most brutal war machines in the world, they would be disabused of that notion after the first airstrikes are coming in, that's what he says. And he continues on talking about how you know, you think any American would be willing to charge the military convoy we get a helicopter fired or calmly walked to the house level with your wife and children inside. That's the reality of asymmetrical warfare against the U.S. Army. They will rain down high explosives on it from distance while you were trying to land a lucky shot between interlocking armor plate. You think these bitches would really be ready to strap explosives on themselves around a police station not just once but as a regular tactic. I don't think so. 

Alex Jones: [00:06:11] He's calling the American people bitches. So they have a total distaste. if you listen to NPR, it's like. In fact I have the cover of Time magazine, bring it to me. It was in here in the stack and somebody took it away. It was it was Newsweek Oh here it is. the end of excess. Why the crisis is good for America. by Kurt Anderson. Time magazine. And they're saying oh this will teach us to live in our means while the control freak parasites sit on top of us. God they have no idea what they're bringing and they have no idea what they've done. And oh my god they don't understand folks. they don't understand the differences between the United States and Iraq. That's why the Pentagon said they can't invade Iran because they couldn't win there. Iraq was an intelligence hive of the United States since the 70s and so they knew how to control it and it was still hellish. But listen how they show who they are badmouthing the American people. Oh I tell you this is sick. This is sick. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:07:17] It's the same guy who was in another article was lamenting any civilian casualties in Iraq. Which is which is a worthy thing to say. But then when it comes to his political enemies, those he disdains, those he considers to be the other, those he considers to be subhuman, which is us, then he has no no no remorse whatsoever about bragging about how he's gonna flatten. 

Alex Jones: [00:07:38] Yeah we're the subhuman Americans that are pro gun and pro freedom that built the country. We're the subhumans that that pay his George Soros pay check that they've sucked out of our economy. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:07:50] You know communists always always believe in purging and killing massive massive amounts of those they consider to be socially undesirable. 

Alex Jones: [00:07:56] I have the Zeitgest guy on the show said I would be sent to re-education. And then I said well that's wrong and he said you can't fathom our mind. They always say this like some wooden apparatchik in the Soviet Union. We know best and so you it's OK to send you to a re-education camp. I said well that's tyranny. And he said no you don't fathom our mind. You don't understand and I guess I can't be educated. Got to break a few eggs

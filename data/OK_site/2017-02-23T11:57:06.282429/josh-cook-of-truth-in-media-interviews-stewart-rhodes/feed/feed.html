<content:encoded>Thought this was interesting when I read it.  Oathkeepers, police, military and first responders, are considered “extremists!”  It is telling that some organizations consider their military, police and first responders extremists for nothing more than wanting to abide by our Constitution!                                      Daryl Johnson (2012), a former senior domestic terrorism analyst at the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s Office
<p>of Intelligence &amp; Analysis stated:</p>
<p>Extremism is perpetuated through the words and actions of individuals, groups and movements – sometimes it transcends</p>
<p>peaceful, law-abiding and constitutionally protected activity and includes threatening, criminal and violent actions…</p>
<p>Extremist belief systems represent a broad range of religious, political and social causes. On the far right of the political</p>
<p>spectrum, right-wing extremists include white supremacists, sovereign citizens (i.e. “Freemen”), paramilitary and militia</p>
<p>groups, and other types of anti-government extremists (i.e. Birthers, Truthers, Oath Keepers, and Three Precenters). On</p>
<p>the far left of the political spectrum, left-wing extremists today are primarily comprised of anarchists (i.e. Black Bloc,</p>
<p>Crimethinc, Ruckus Society, etc.), Black nationalists (such as the New Black Panther Party and New Afrikan [sic.]</p>
<p>Movement), and some fringe elements of the Occupy Wall Street movement. There are also singleissue extremists</p>
<p>representing both extreme ends of the political spectrum. Singleissue extremists are distinct from the other types because</p>
<p>they are overwhelmingly focused on a single political or social cause. On the far right, single-issue extremists focus their</p>
<p>attention on targets related to abortion, illegal immigration or federal income tax issues. On the far left, single-issue</p>
<p>extremists direct their interests against targets dealing with the environment (i.e. earth rights), animal liberation or antiwar</p>
<p>causes. Source; http://www.judiciary.senate.gov/pdf/9-19-12JohnsonTestimony.pdf</p>

<content:encoded>I’m also a retired cop and I agree things could have gone sideways very quickly BUT for the cool, controlled and measured way the O.K. guys handle themselves. While I wish the optics could have been better the message was sent and received without incident. I also thought they came off well last year protecting private property/life from looters and arsonists. While controversial, I believe the envelope was pushed to the limit this time but once again the O.K. guys walked it right up to the line and stopped. I believe they came off better looking then the Chief of Police who appeared to be ready enough to make, and what he had to know, was an illegal arrest and or detention of the O.K. But I ask you, if the chief had ordered his officers to arrest the O.K.s what would have happened?

<content:encoded>Retired cop, I’m also a retired cop &amp; understand your concern. Anytime you have two or more armed fractions, with different agendas, there is the potential for a simple misunderstanding to turn into an armed conflict. It would have been a catastrophic if something had gone wrong but the O.K. guys keep their cool, their muzzles down and got their message out. Even when confronted by the chief of the PD the guys appeared cooperative but still made their points  A fine line to walk indeed! I do wish the optics could have been better but even now, looking back on it, I couldn’t think of a better way to handle it. As I’m sure you know the minds of the rank &amp; file PD members were with the chief but their hearts were with the O.K. guys.

<content:encoded>As time passes and events unfold Oath Keepers hold true. We ( myself a member ) swore an oath that the politicians don’t respect. I will retire from public service in 2 years, never to look back. I’m proud I served my community. My sons serve now one fire, one police. Our governing bodies changed the rules to their blaintaint lies and own needs. We have created a generation of puppets and Americans that don’t know or care about the rights they protest are violated. Few truly stand knowledgable of our basic fundamental rights. I have been doing my part as a FREE AMERICAN  as long as I can remember. I swear this Oath ” I will never give in.” Stand Free together or we will surely fall.<br/>

<content:encoded>I am a bit perplexed at your comment, sir. The uniformed police, troopers and riot control officers failed to do the job given them by the public at large-to serve and protect. They “went in hard, with a high profile, into a situation …” and what was the result? Burned buildings, lost businesses and homes and shattered lives. How does that engender confidence in their abilities as peace officers, law enforcers? In several videos posted of the public’s interaction with the Oath Keepers that responded to the call, it’s quite evident that they (the local citizens) were curious, that they wanted to learn. It was also quite evident that they were ignorant of their Constitutional rights, given them under the mandates of the Bill of Rights, and that the Oath Keepers on scene were perfectly suited to teach them what their rights are. There was no evidence that Oath Keepers “agitated or inflamed” anything, but plenty of evidence that the results of their presence was buildings, businesses and lives that were preserved, as is. Lastly, your final sentence is actually quite revealing. Are cops so used to lying to the public that they sneer at organizations that believe their own press releases? In my humble opinion, it’s the very fact that Oath Keepers believes what they teach so deeply, that they are willing to put their time, money and their very lives behind what they say. That, sir, is what makes me trust having an Oath Keeper at my back in any battle, whether it’s a battle of words or a battle of bullets. Good day, sir.

<content:encoded>I am a Native American Black man, and member of the NRA since 1990. I have been studying the Oath Keepers for years and I am very fond of this organization and what it stands for. I just met a woman Oath Keeper who was more prepared with her “bug-out” gear than my entire collection. That’s how you ensure justice. Not this “sheep-like” walking through the streets begging a brainwashed, police-state robot not to shoot you, and definitely not this disorganized, emotional, clown-ass, shouting and throwing rocks in the streets. I bet if the “police-state” robots encounter some well-armed, highly-trained, disciplined citizens who just stand their ground and say “enough is enough” very nonchalantly and unemotional-like, they’d think twice about shooting citizens unjustly. LONG LIVE THE OATH KEEPERS!

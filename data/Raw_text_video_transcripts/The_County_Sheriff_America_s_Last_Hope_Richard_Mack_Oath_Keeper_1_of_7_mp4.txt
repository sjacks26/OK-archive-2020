Stewart Rhodes: [00:00:05] Let's bring up Sheriff Mack. I can do that forever. OK. Without further ado Sheriff Mack. 

Richard Mack: [00:00:11] Thanks Stewart 

Richard Mack: [00:00:17] But Stewart really blended into a lot of things that I wanted to say and some of the questions were really appropriate to what I'm going to be addressing. OK. Let me tell you right now I have studied this, studied this, and studied this. prayed about, it prayed about, it prayed about it. have been to the depths of depression, dismayal, discouragement, and who wasn't During the last election. Okay if you weren't there something wrong with you. And so this book was born out of my complete discouragement and hopeless, feelings of hopelessness, While I was watching the last election. and at the very beginning. Now get this. I'm telling you the truth. I really like Barack Obama now. First thing you're saying is is Sheriff Mack nuts or what. Why would somebody logically like Barack Obama, because of what he was doing. He was beating Hillary Clinton. I love that. And then it turned out we got both of them. So that didn't last long for me either did it. No. 

Richard Mack: [00:01:41] We're going to get really fundamental with some things here. But the main thing is while I was thus contemplating our demise in America and my wife kept telling me to turn the TV off and I said I can't stop watching this. It's like you know there's going to be a horrible wreck. You're always going to watch it aren't you. Well I couldn't stop watching the destruction of my country. And it just made me madder and madder. But I still couldn't stop watching. And during that I said there has to be some hope. I'm an eternal optimist. And the title of this book came to me right then and I had it out like three months later. This book came out February 15th that's already sold over 10000 copies. We're trying to get these out across America as much as we can. The county sheriff, America's last hope. if any of you think that there is hope in Washington D.C. then then I'm not going to sell you silver. I've got beachfront property for you in Omaha. OK please see me immediately after this. OK. Because Washington D.C. is a write off. I think you need to know what's going on there. I think you need to keep patting Ron Paul on the back who I totally supported. I know him. I've sent him a book he and I still need to talk about that. 

Richard Mack: [00:03:03] But you have one chance left to save your country. And it's at the local level. Let me emphasize something before we get going here. This book is a paradigm shift for all of us. You have got to start focusing on this. OK. All of us at lunch were talking about this and this and this and this and this. All the conspiracy theories are wonderful. Yeah we got thousands of them don't we, we really got dozens of them. If you go talk to your sheriff and ask him why he's not joining other sheriffs and arresting Barack Obama for not really being the president or what's he going to do about chem trails or how about solving the truth about 9/11 or what really happened to JFK or on and on and on with all these conspiracy theories and they might very well be true. OK. You're going to lose that battle before you even begin. 

Richard Mack: [00:04:12] This is a battle for our country, our Constitution, our nation. The fate of our country does not lie with Barack Obama. It lies with us. It lies with you, The boss of your sheriff, who has the authority, the duty, the jurisdictional responsibility to protect you from all enemies both foreign and domestic. 

Richard Mack: [00:04:39] Now let let me just do a real brief history here. I was a sheriff in Arizona I was the first one in the United States to file a lawsuit against the Clinton administration to stop the onerous requirements of the Brady Bill. It's the first time in U.S. history that Congress promulgated a law that commandeered the office of a local official. in this case the sheriff. it was unfunded, unconstitutional gun control scheme that forced me to participate in gun control that I knew was unconstitutional and knew couldn't, I couldn't do it. So I filed a lawsuit the very day the Brady Bill took effect. And we also filed an injunction that very day so that they wouldn't arrest me because the Brady bill actually said that we could be arrested for failure to comply. And Janet Reno immediately issued a memo pursuant to orders from Clinton that the the part that said that whoever knowingly failed to comply would be subject to a year in jail or a $10000 fine or both, only applied to the FFL which are the gun shop owners. OK. The federal firearms licensee. 

Richard Mack: [00:05:57] So we looked up and already had done our homework. My Lawyer Dave Hardy from Arizona had already done his homework and I knew that was a lie. They actually discussed that wording and it said they even discussed that sounds like we're going to arrest the sheriff if he doesn't obey us. And they left it. OK. And then Judge Roll In my case said Janet Reno can't change the law By fiat or in other words by writing a memo. And so it stayed. We got our injunction and we won at The district court, we lost at the circuit court. Whereas Arizona circuit court. San Francisco. So we of course we lost there. And that's the most liberal and overturned court in the country and we barely lost two to one. but we had a couple other sheriff join the lawsuit in the Fifth Circuit which was Texas and Louisiana. Sheriff Kugan sheriff Romero won. ultimately out of over 3000 sheriffs seven joined this lawsuit. Sheriff Prince from Montana and I ended up at the U.S. Supreme Court together. He filed about six weeks after I did and without any collaboration whatsoever. the first time he and I met was at the Phil Donahue Show in New York. and when he filed I was on my way to work and I heard it on the CBS Morning News on the radio and I hit the ceiling. I was so thrilled. I did not want to be the lone ranger on this lawsuit. You know what happened to people who fought against Bill Clinton. And so Sheriff Prince and I won a case that the United States Supreme Court we won. 

## Mack does a “limp wrist” gesture when he says “San Francisco,” leading to general laughter in the crowd.

Richard Mack: [00:07:42] OK I'll bet. I'll bet there is not any of you who know anything about that case. There was the most hidden case in our in other monumental Supreme Court decision. It's been hidden from you. and I was supposed to be on Meet the Press right after this came out and on Friday they counsel canceled us were supposed to fly out the next day and they canceled it. everybody started canceling all our interviews. Janet Reno issued a memo nationwide saying to all sheriffs and chiefs that this was a token victory for the NRA and otherwise meaningless and don't change anything. Just keep doing what you're doing. 

Richard Mack: [00:08:16] Yeah. And so this this really was spun to be forgotten. And so now pursuant to this, I've resurrected some of the main points in this and put it in the book. and I'll tell you just like anybody else any lawyer, any sheriff, cop, anybody. If you find anything in the book that's incorrect or untrue I'll eat that part out and remove it permanently. OK. 

Richard Mack: [00:08:47] But the paradigm shift that we're part of right now is that we're not going to focus on these other issues. that will be solved when we get our Constitution back, County by county. But we've got to focus on what the sheriff can grab. And we've got to follow the KISS philosophy here don't we. keep it simple stupid or he's not going to get it. You go in there talking about all these other things. He's not going to get it. And he's just going to think you're a nut. And a lot of you are. here because I know I've been around you guys for a long time and we're all nuts, because we live in, We believe in God and freedom and family and country enough and home schooling or whatever. OK. We're not mainstream. So of course we're a nut. So you've got to take it back way back when you were first learning about these things because that's where your sheriff is and we've got to get him on board. And you need to take him in this book. and you need to take this book to the county commissioners in your county as well. give it to your favorite cop. Give it to your favorite deputy. because there's those guys are the ones that are going to run against the sheriffs that aren't coming on board with this. They refuse to comply with the Constitution. That's all this is about. It's about two things. Take and keep your oath of office and follow the Constitution

<p>Despite an alert followed by an “all clear,” threats to service members and their families on U.S. soil by Islamist terrorists remain real, at least according to those making them.</p>
<p>I first became aware of a “For Official Use Only” <strong><a href="https://publicintelligence.net/fbi-middle-eastern-males/" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'https://publicintelligence.net/fbi-middle-eastern-males/', 'FBI alert');" target="_blank">FBI alert</a></strong> concerning the reported threats to families in Colorado and Wyoming from a report by Public Intelligence.  While confident in that organization’s reliability for vetting what they present, I nonetheless <strong><a href="http://waronguns.blogspot.com/2015/08/fbi-alert.html" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://waronguns.blogspot.com/2015/08/fbi-alert.html', 'contacted the FBI’s Denver Division');" target="_blank">contacted the FBI’s Denver Division</a></strong> for corroboration, which they declined to provide.</p>
<p>Regardless, media outlets soon <strong><a href="http://denver.cbslocal.com/2015/08/04/fbi-middle-eastern-men-intimidating-u-s-military-families-in-colorado-wyoming/" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://denver.cbslocal.com/2015/08/04/fbi-middle-eastern-men-intimidating-u-s-military-families-in-colorado-wyoming/', 'confirmed the alert was genuine');" target="_blank">confirmed the alert was genuine</a></strong>. Which made what happened next curious, to say the least.</p>
<p>“After issuing two alerts about Middle Eastern men approaching military families in Colorado and Wyoming and making suspicious statements, like, your husband is a U.S. interrogator; the FBI has decided their warnings contained no credible threats to military personnel or their families,” <strong><a href="http://coloradopeakpolitics.com/2015/08/07/nothing-to-see-here-fbi-recants-fbi-alert/" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://coloradopeakpolitics.com/2015/08/07/nothing-to-see-here-fbi-recants-fbi-alert/', 'Colorado Peak Politics reported');" target="_blank">Colorado Peak Politics reported</a></strong>.</p>
<p>“The FBI continues to coordinate with its military and law enforcement partners to ensure the safety of our communities,” the <strong><a href="http://www.greeleytribune.com/news/17601608-113/fbi-no-credible-threats-against-military-personnel-families" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.greeleytribune.com/news/17601608-113/fbi-no-credible-threats-against-military-personnel-families', 'follow-up media statement');" target="_blank">follow-up media statement</a></strong> read. “The FBI asks the community to remain vigilant and report signs of suspicious activity to law enforcement.”</p>
<p>With the alert concerns and subsequent denial as backdrop, the latest development makes it fair to wonder if the “all clear” has been premature, or if information vital to the safety of military personnel is being withheld. That’s because <strong><a href="http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2015/08/12/soon-very-soon-you-will-see-pro-islamic-state-hacking-group-issues-chilling-warning-to-america/" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2015/08/12/soon-very-soon-you-will-see-pro-islamic-state-hacking-group-issues-chilling-warning-to-america/', 'per a new report on The Blaze');" target="_blank">per a new report on The Blaze</a></strong>, a pro-Islamic State hacking group has obtained information on members of the military, and is threatening to go after them where they live:</p>
<blockquote><p>“the brothers don’t need to attack them in military bases or secured buildings. they can now turn up in their houses. in their homes. this is war, what did you expect? u think u can bomb the islamic state and we don’t do nothing back? soon, very soon you will see.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Obviously, the credibility of such threats, including the capability of those making them to carry them out, and the reality that disinformation is also a weapon used to force targets to expend energy and resources, are factors that need to be considered. Likewise, we need to consider that the FBI alert could have been discounted to cover for security holes allowing personal information of service members to be accessed.</p>
<p>In the absence of validated intelligence, it will pay to keep eyes and ears open, to discuss potentials with those in the know,  to share information that has been vetted for credibility, and to do what Oath Keepers do: Be on guard.</p>

<content:encoded>The idea of a “series” of regular ongoing and nationally rotating “Tactical Training Camps” would be a fantastic idea.
<p>Tactical Training and physical fitness would likely draw a lot of interest. </p>
<p>A proper “attendee applicatio”, a “background check”, and an regular assigned OK background checker would help sort out the riff-raff.</p>

<content:encoded>I think a training site should be found in the American Southwest Desert also. Desert combat has it’s own unique problems. It would be good if a training exercise were sponsored every month at different locations around the country and by different groups. I am sure there are plenty of patriotic drill and specialty training sergeants out there who would love to volunteer there time for the training of newbies.

<content:encoded>Don’t be ridiculous, it is an HONOR to be on the feds UNLAWFUL “watch list”.  
<p>It means that you are defending our legitimate government from the many Traitors and domestic enemies that are “serving” within our governments.  It also lets those that are serving start to understand our way of government and what THEIR Oath requires of them so they will not be Traitors for “just following orders” or “just doing their jobs”, and will instead have made an informed decision to become a Treasonous scum against their own country.</p>

<content:encoded>Way to go guys. Lets just post an article about a training camp for every fed on the planet to easily access. Im beginning to wonder who’s side you are really on. Don’t think for even a minute that there will not be at least a dozen undercover feds at that camp. My suggestion would be to steer clear of this event unless you want to be on a fed watch list.

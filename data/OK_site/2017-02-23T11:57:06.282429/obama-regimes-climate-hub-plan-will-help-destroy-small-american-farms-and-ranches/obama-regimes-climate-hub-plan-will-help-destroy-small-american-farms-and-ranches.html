<p>This is yet another Agenda 21 program we must watch and defend our communities against. – Shorty Dawkins, Associate Editor</p>
<p><a href="http://www.blacklistednews.com/Obama_Regime%27s_Climate_Hub_Plan_Will_Help_Destroy_Small_American_Farms_and_Ranches/32679/0/5/5/Y/M.html" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.blacklistednews.com/Obama_Regime%27s_Climate_Hub_Plan_Will_Help_Destroy_Small_American_Farms_and_Ranches/32679/0/5/5/Y/M.html', 'This article');" target="_blank">This article</a> comes from BlackListedNews.com</p>
<p>by Lee Rogers</p>
<p>The Obama regime recently announced that they are establishing <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2014/02/05/politics/obama-climate-hubs/" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.cnn.com/2014/02/05/politics/obama-climate-hubs/', 'seven regional hubs designed to help Americans mitigate the alleged scourge of climate change');" target="_blank">seven regional hubs designed to help Americans mitigate the alleged scourge of climate change</a>.   The first climate hubs will be established in Iowa, New Hampshire,  North Carolina, Colorado, Oklahoma, Oregon and New Mexico.  Additional  subsidiary hubs will be established in Michigan, Puerto Rico and  California.  These so-called climate hubs are nothing more than a  backdoor way for these authoritarian jackasses to exercise more control  over farmers and ranchers.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">First off climate change is an invented problem.   The climate is always changing due to the Earth’s cyclical movement  within the solar system.  This is why we have seasons and different  types of weather throughout the year.  Climate change is not a new  phenomenon and it has occurred long before man began running power  plants and driving automobiles.  This climate change term is now used  because the original propaganda first failed in the 1970s when they said  that man-made carbon emissions were responsible for causing global  cooling and that we were on the brink of an ice age.  When it became  obvious that a new ice age was not going to happen they switched gears  and claimed that man-made carbon emissions were responsible for global  warming only a few decades later.  So by using a neutral term like  climate change it takes the unpredictability of the naturally changing  climate out of the equation.  As a result they can now always claim that  there is a problem with some sort of human related activity because the  climate by default is always changing.  It is some of the most  unbelievable bull shit one could imagine yet week minded fools somehow  still believe it.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/environment/climatechange/6619796/Climate-scientists-accused-of-manipulating-global-warming-data.html" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/environment/climatechange/6619796/Climate-scientists-accused-of-manipulating-global-warming-data.html', 'Scientists have even been caught manipulating their own data');" target="_blank">Scientists have even been caught manipulating their own data</a> to fit in with this silly theory.  The reason being is that any science related to this garbage gets <a href="http://www.gao.gov/key_issues/climate_change_funding_management/issue_summary" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.gao.gov/key_issues/climate_change_funding_management/issue_summary', 'government funding');" target="_blank">government funding</a>.  So it is in the best interest of these scientists to continue promoting this insanity.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">So here we have the Obama regime using a phony  theory based off of manipulated and biased scientific data to justify  the establishment of these so-called climate hubs.  They are claiming <a href="http://www.usda.gov/oce/climate_change/regional_hubs.htm" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.usda.gov/oce/climate_change/regional_hubs.htm', 'the purpose of these climate hubs is to help rural communities affected by climate change');" target="_blank">the purpose of these climate hubs is to help rural communities affected by climate change</a>.   In reality this is just another power grab by the federal government to  exercise control over farmers and ranchers.  Under the guise of helping  these people they will soon begin interfering with these operations as  part of an effort to put them out of business.  The federal government  hates family farmers and ranchers because they represent competition to  the big food manufacturers.  Smaller farming and ranching operations do  not have the same lobbying influence that the large corporate interests  have which is why there is an incentive for the federal government to do  these things.  These local farms and ranches also represent a pillar of  self sufficiency which is something that the federal government greatly  despises.  After all, how can the federal government control all of its  slaves if they can grow their own food and refuse to eat the real life  equivalent of Soylent Green?</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Seriously though, why on earth would farmers or  ranchers need the federal government to help them with to deal with  changing weather?  These people are already used to dealing with  cyclical environmental changes so there is no good reason why these  climate hubs are needed.  This is especially true considering that the  concept of man-made carbon emissions causing catastrophic changes to the  planet have proven to be total nonsense.  It is just an excuse for the  federal government to meddle in their affairs.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In addition, the establishment of these climate hubs is an initiative that appears to have come out of the <a href="http://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/index.php?page=view&amp;nr=23&amp;type=400" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/index.php?page=view&amp;nr=23&amp;type=400', 'UN’s Agenda 21 plan');" target="_blank">UN’s Agenda 21 plan</a>.   Agenda 21 was a plan developed in the early 1990s to move populations  of people from rural areas into large cities under the guise of  sustainable development and biodiversity.   This fact alone should make  people question the true purpose behind this madness.</p>
<p>Like almost  every idea that has originated from the Obama regime, this idea sucks.   There’s no reason for the federal government to involve themselves with  farmers and ranchers under the guise of fighting a non-existent  problem.  There’s no doubt that these climate hubs will grow into a  bureaucracy that will be used to help destroy small farming and ranching  operations around America.  This is the real reason why this system is  being put into place.  Over time, look for an unending amount of rules,  regulations and harassment to originate from these organizations.</p>

<p>The Federal Bureau of Investigation and other law enforcement agencies <a href="http://www.thedailysheeple.com/fbi-manhunt-is-on-crazy-prepper-on-the-loose_062014" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.thedailysheeple.com/fbi-manhunt-is-on-crazy-prepper-on-the-loose_062014', 'blasted alerts all over the country');" target="_blank">blasted alerts all over the country</a> earlier this week advising Americans to be on the lookout for   ‘Doomsday  Prepper’ Martin Winters, who police say was stockpiling over   fifty  “high powered” rifles, deadly booby traps and food in  preparation  for an  “end times” event. Neighbors interviewed by  mainstream news  were  terrified about the allegations, leaving some  with the impression  that  Winters was “crazy” because he allegedly  claimed that he would  kill  federal agents if necessary.</p>
<p>While  SWAT officials indicated the likelihood that they would have to    engage Winters in a firefight was high, friends and family suggested    otherwise, saying that Winters may have had views different from most    people but insisting that he is a “good guy” who wouldn’t hurt others    unless it was necessary to do so in self defense.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a>Police  went so far as to suggest that Winters had  essentially gone  off the  reservation and that he didn’t care whether he  lived or died,  and that  he was “plotting” a confrontation with the  federal government.</p>
<p>But the claims and allegations may have been blown way out of    proportion. After police obtained a warrant to search Winters’ home    based on information obtained from a confidential informant they were    probably surprised that not only did Winters have no explosive booby    troops set up all over his property as had been claimed, he was also far    short of having possession of the fifty high-powered rifles that   police  said he had been stockpiling.</p>
<blockquote><p>Federal agents this week searched the Florida home of a    ‘doomsday prepper’ they alleged had stockpiled over 50 high-powered    assault rifles and several explosive devices buried around his property    as ‘booby traps’.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>However the warrant showed up little more than barrels of food.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>[…]</blockquote>
<blockquote><p>But in federal court on  Wednesday, Winters’ defense  attorney, Ellis  Faught, said the  confidential informant’s estimates  were wide of the  mark.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>The informant had bought four so-called destructive devices from Winters, but they were not buried as booby traps.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Five guns were found locked in a safe, according to 10 News.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>[…]</blockquote>
<blockquote><p>‘None of this was there,’ Fraught told the court, the station reported.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>‘And it’s my understanding that no guns were dug up.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>‘It  was alleged by the government that there were 50 to 60  guns and  I’m  only aware of five of them that were found and they were  found in  his  house in a safe.’<em> </em></p></blockquote>

<p>While Martin Winters’ political ideology and interests may differ   from  those of most Americans, the government had tried him in a public   court  before any evidence had been presented or found. Some of his   neighbors  were terrified of this “crazy” individual after they had been   told of  his alleged crimes, and the mainstream media was happy to  oblige  the  narrative that this right-wing survivalist extremist was a  danger  to  himself and society.</p>
<p>The FBI issued the following  photo to its media surrogates during the   manhunt in an effort to  depict Winters as a survivalist who had gone   off the deep end:</p>

<p>His daughters, however, say that Winters is not violent at all and that he is a loving father and grandfather.</p>
<p>“I think they took the whole context of him being prepared and twisted it,” says his daughter Tracy.</p>

<p>Video: “This whole manhunt happened because Winters was trying to protect his family”</p>

<p>Senator Rand Paul <a href="http://www.shtfplan.com/headline-news/paul-to-congress-someone-who-has-guns-ammunition-7-days-of-food-can-be-considered-a-potential-terrorist_12052011" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.shtfplan.com/headline-news/paul-to-congress-someone-who-has-guns-ammunition-7-days-of-food-can-be-considered-a-potential-terrorist_12052011', 'warned Americans');" target="_blank">warned Americans</a> about this growing trend of demonizing innocent Americans in a speech    he delivered to Congress three years ago in opposition to the National    Defense Authorization Act noting that those who don’t subscribe to the    status quo could be branded as extremists and terrorists. Paul’s    prediction couldn’t have been more accurate, especially considering the    manhunt and circumstances surrounding the ordeal with Martin Winters:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>There are laws on the books now that characterize who might be a terrorist.</strong></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Someone missing fingers on their hands is a suspect according to the Department of Justice. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Someone who has guns</span>, someone who has ammunition that is weatherproofed, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">someone who has more than seven days of food in their house can be considered a potential terrorist.</span></strong></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>If  you are suspected by these activities do you want the  government  to  have the ability to send you to Guantanamo Bay for  indefinite   detention?</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>I   suspect, we’re  not talking about someone who has been tried or found   guilty. We’re  talking about someone suspected of activities.</strong></span></p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://youtu.be/hfcYQxVeY6I" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://youtu.be/hfcYQxVeY6I', 'httpv://youtu.be/hfcYQxVeY6I');">httpv://youtu.be/hfcYQxVeY6I</a></p>
<p>We have, unfortunately, reached a  point in  America where talking about  ideas that don’t go along with  mainstream  thought has become  suspicious activity, and those engaging  in it are now  identified as  extremists or persons of interest. With the  surveillance  state rapidly  expanding its capabilities to monitor  conversations and  interactions  with those around us, it has become more  important now than  ever  before to keep our personal activities as  private as possible.<br/>
OPSEC, a term preppers use to describe <a href="http://readynutrition.com/resources/mums-the-word-using-opsec-with-preps_21032010/" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://readynutrition.com/resources/mums-the-word-using-opsec-with-preps_21032010/', 'operational security');" target="_blank">operational security</a>,    is a key tenet of staying safe in the event of a major disaster. But   in  this day and age it is a concept that is just as important to   implement  while everything is seemingly stable, because sharing too   much with the  wrong people may make you a target, not just to looters   and thieves,  but overzealous government agents as well.</p>
<p>Today Martin Winters is a domestic terrorist. Tomorrow it might be you.</p>

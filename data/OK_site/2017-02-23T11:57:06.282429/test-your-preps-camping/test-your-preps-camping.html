<p>There is no reason that prepping has to be a drudge or a chore.  As a   matter of fact, preparedness can be combined with a hobby and actually   be productive and fun at the same time.</p>
<p>What kind of hobbies?  Some examples include fishing, hunting,   biking, hiking, crafting (for example with paracord), reading (survival   fiction!) and of course, camping.  I know that I tend to be repetitive   when it comes to extolling the virtues of combining hobbies with   prepping but the fact remains, doing so is the very best way to coast a   reluctant spouse, partner or family member into the preparedness   lifestyle.</p>
<p>Each of these hobbies, in one way or another, helps <a href="http://www.backdoorsurvival.com/45-pioneer-skills/" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.backdoorsurvival.com/45-pioneer-skills/', 'hone a skill');" target="_blank">hone a skill</a> that could become valuable in a post SHTF world.  Even reading can be   considered skill-building.  As you get into the mind of someone who must   make life or death decisions, you are challenged to think about the   actions you would take if faced with a similar situation.</p>
<p>But I am getting off track.</p>
<p>Today’s <a href="http://www.backdoorsurvival.com/category/fast-track-prep-tip/" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.backdoorsurvival.com/category/fast-track-prep-tip/', 'Fast Track Tip');" target="_blank">Fast Track Tip</a> is all about the virtues of camping. Backdoor Survival <a href="http://www.backdoorsurvival.com/contributing-authors/" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.backdoorsurvival.com/contributing-authors/', 'Contributing Author');"><strong>Contributing Author</strong></a> Rob Hanus is back with his thoughts on camping as the ideal platform for testing your preps.<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Test Your Preps – Go Camping!</strong></p>
<p><em>When it comes to camping, I have noticed there seems to  be three  types of people: Those that have never camped; those that have  camped  before but have not gone in a while; and those that go camping on  a  regular basis. If you are a prepper and fall into either of the first   two categories, it is time to pack up and head out to the field!</em></p>
<p><em>One aspect of prepping you need to keep in mind,is if you did not   personally test it, it does not work! Camping is a good time to test   your preparedness items, as many of the things you need for your   emergency preparedness kits are either directly used in camping, or are   closely related.</em></p>
<p><em>Going camping is like putting yourself into a controlled survival   situation. The advantage, though, is you are in control of the  situation  and can always go back to the comfort of your home at  anytime.</em></p>
<p><em>Much of what you need when you go camping is a direct parallel to   being prepared. You need to provide things like your own shelter,  food,  water, a way to cook, <a class="ext-link" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F38YI2/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B000F38YI2&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=continmoti-20&amp;linkId=GBGVUMMGTUXN5NUS" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F38YI2/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B000F38YI2&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=continmoti-20&amp;linkId=GBGVUMMGTUXN5NUS', 'sleeping bags');" rel="external nofollow">sleeping bags</a> and pads, and the like. You also get to test and improve your survival   skills, like starting a fire, forecasting the weather, cooking over an   open flame, dealing with sanitation in a field environment, and many   others. Even learning to deal without electric light is something that   you need to do when camping.</em></p>
<p><em>If you have not camped before, start out by going to one of the   established campsites that have toilets and running water. This makes it   much easier to get used to being out in the great outdoors. Once you   think you are ready, try going to a primitive camping area, where you   need to bring everything you need, such as all of your water, a way to   make an expedient toilet, a way to keep your food cold, and so on.</em></p>
<p><em>Camping is also a great way to take your kids exploring and  getting  them used to doing things the “old fashioned” way. If your  children are  young, teach them survival skills appropriate for their  age, such as  what to do when lost and fire safety, and staying away  from dangerous  insects and animals. As kids get older, survival skills  like starting a  fire, making a shelter and other field-craft can make  them a more  confident person as they grow up.</em></p>
<p><em>It does not matter when you go, as you should try camping at   different times of the year. Different seasons call for a different way   of camping. For example, winter camping is completely different than  the  other seasons and should not be tried by the novice camper, though  you  should not let the cold and snow thwart you from having a fun and   educational time.</em></p>
<p><em>You do not even have to leave your home to go camping. Camping at   home in your backyard, or even in your living room, can be a good way  to  ease younger children into the idea of camping in the wilds. Most  kids,  though, would love the backyard adventure of sleeping the night  in a  tent. Even for the novice camper, this is a good way to learn  things  like how to put together your new tent, figure out how the  cook-stove  works, and test out the sleeping bag to make sure that it is  warm  enough, without having to worry about having to sleep in the car  if  something goes wrong.</em></p>
<p><em>Also, as a beginning camper, you will need to start acquiring the   necessary equipment. Tents, sleeping pads and bags, a cook stove,   outdoor camping gear, and water containers are some of the things that   you will need when camping.</em></p>
<p><em>Even for experienced campers, going out to the wilds and setting  up a  camp for the weekend leads to new discoveries. It also helps you  figure  out how to do something better such as learning what to bring  next time  so you are either more comfortable or have more convenience.</em></p>
<p><em>Whether driving to a campsite across the state or setting up in  your  backyard, camping is a great way to test your preps and build  experience  using your gear.</em></p>
<p><strong>The Final Word</strong></p>
<p>In the old days, meaning the 1980’s, my idea of camping was staying   in a hotel without room service and a bathtub.  Seriously.  Then I   bought a boat and learned that it was a lot more fun to rough it while   anchored in remote cove with limited water, limited power, and a minimum   of sanitation facilities.</p>
<p>I think camping (or boating) is a great way to learn to MacGyver –   meaning fix stuff using your wits and whatever happens to be available   in the moment.  As a matter of fact, I have been compiling a list of all   the reasons camping will help you prepare for emergencies but being  the  tease that I am, I will hold those for another day.</p>

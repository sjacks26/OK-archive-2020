<p>LILLE, France | By Morade Azzouz</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A day ago he was just another tourist on a train. By Saturday, U.S. Airman First Class Spencer Stone was recovering from knife wounds in a hospital in France, being thanked for foiling what the French government called an attempted terrorist attack.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Stone was touring Europe with two friends he grew up with in California. The three men in their 20s helped overpower a Kalashnikov-toting suspected Islamist militant on a high speed train heading for Paris from Amsterdam.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Among the other heroes of the night-time drama was a Frenchman on his way to the toilet who was first to tackle the assailant as he entered the carriage, and a 62-year-old Briton who still had blood spattered over his shirt as he spoke to journalists on Friday night.</p>
<p>But it may have been Stone, 23, of Lajes Air Base, Azores, who took the biggest risk.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“He was the first one to jump on him, he’s the one who got cut up … none of us are injured but Spencer took a few injuries and he just had no fear,” 23-year-old student Anthony Sadler, told Reuters.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“That’s our friend so once we saw him go we had to go and join him … we couldn’t have just left everybody die like that. It was a crazy situation, said Sadler, a student at Sacramento State University.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Sadler said everything happened very fast as the attacker, armed with an automatic pistol and a box cutter as well as the AK-47 assault rifle, appeared to try to clear his weapon which seemed to be jammed.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One passenger was hit by a bullet, and was in a serious but stable condition, authorities said. Stone is due to be released from hospital later on Saturday.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“I woke up to basically people ducking and then I was, like, ‘Why is everybody ducking?’ and then, when I turned round to look, he, the gunman, had just entered the car with the AK and then I was, like: ‘This is really happening’,” Sadler said.</p>

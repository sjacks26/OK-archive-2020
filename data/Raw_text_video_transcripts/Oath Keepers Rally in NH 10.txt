Title screen: October 14, 2010 Dover, New Hampshire Rochester Family Division Court

UOK: The family have due process rights that need to be protected, that’s a separate issue. We’re concerned that they used OK as a militia, and the fact that they produced firearms.

SR: Here’s the bottom line. It shouldn’t be about the politics of the parents. It should be about the welfare of the child. I’m the founder of OK. The association with us has no bearing, it’s not relevant whatsoever to whether the parent

UM1: They’re not saying it has any bearing.

SR: Yes they are. It’s included in the reasons for taking the child. The judge adopted those reasons listed in the affidavit as the findings and facts for the court.

UM1: Have you seen the affidavit?

SR: Yes.

UM1: I thought the DCYF’s stance was that they wouldn’t interfere because of political groups. That’s not the reason why

SR: She said in the article yesterday that wouldn’t be the primary reason. She said we’ll list a bunch of stuff, the judge will tell us what’s relevant. Okay. That’s not acceptable. You don’t list your associates. Say you’re an ACLU member, and they come to your house to [garbled] a child. They shouldn’t list your ACLU member status. What does that have to do with anything? It’s irrelevant.

SR: (0:01:24.0) Here’s the other big problem. 1A, I’m sure you understand this as a journalist. When you start to have people worry about whether their affiliations and associations are going to cause heat on them because of the law, it starts to chill their own speech. You’re chilling the speech of people, they’ll be afraid to associate and speak out. What if they put an anti-war protestor group on a list of potential extremists, then next thing you know it’s DCYF action against somebody. They say by the way, they’re a member of ANSWER. That’s not legitimate. Okay. That’s why we’re here.

UOK: Look at the affidavit it’s item number 7 on the list.

SR: We certainly do think that when you have the politicization of protective services, it calls into question their motivation. It hurts their job. How can someone take them seriously and trust what they’re doing is right when they call into question their own motives by using politics. 

UOK: Our organization is made up of local current serving and retired law enforcement. The thing is, that’s offensive to me. I spent 27 years in the local police department, right over in Massachusetts. We spent a career, most everybody I know. Dave Freeman from Las Vegas Metro. Our career was based on protecting kids, if nothing else. It’s offensive to me that they would say that, because I’m associated with OK, that whole career I did was meaningless. It’s offensive. That shouldn’t have been in there.

SR: She’s a retired police chief in Massachusetts [points at the woman standing next to him]. He’s a retired police captain.

GL: (0:02:57.5) This is SR. This is John [garbled]

SR: I got your emails. I’m really scrambling.

J: Everything’s been posted on [garbled]

SR: I’m not in that fight. That’s my first point to you. My fight is about them listing political associations. I could care less whether he’s a dirt bag. I care about, I don’t want DCYF politicized
 GL: DCYS

SR: I thought it was Division of Children, Youth, and Families

GL: Yeah, we call them DCYS

SR: I don’t want them politicized and used as a weapon against anyone. That’s why I’m here. That’s the only reason why all these guys are here. Retired police captain from Lowell, Mass. Retired police sergeant from Las Vegas Metro. We’re here (0:03:40.6) on that issue alone. Your fight for your son is irrelevant to us. Whatever it is.

J: [really hard to hear] I’m here to make sure [can’t hear]

SR: Right. Upon that we can agree. Whatever else goes on. I do think, I agree with Pastor Lear, I do think legislature, based upon this use of DCYF as a political weapon, this alone justifies [garbled] training and procedures. It has no bearing. I’m not saying their allegations against John are legitimate or illegitimate.

Unknown speaker: Please identify Jonathan versus John

SR: Okay, Jonathan, whatever. I’m saying that’s got nothing to do with the reason why we’re here. It also doesn’t have anything to do with why I think they should have a hard look at DCYF. (0:04:40.7) And frankly across the country things like this have happened. People have been targeted at least in part because of their political associations, because they have spoken out. That’s gotta come to an end. That’s all I have to say.

## Video cuts to a sign that says Constitutional Rights Are Not Crimes and Not Cause For Seizure. Another sign says Doesn’t Care About Your Family!!. Another sign says DCYF = Kangaroo Court – No Evidence – No Jury

## Video jumps

SR: (0:04:59.1) We’ll see now if they come to their senses. At least on that point. [Someone asks him a question, apparently] This is our first step in doing that. We’ve [garbled] DCYF, saying you should, by whatever mechanism you choose or can use, strike your affidavit, amend it, take our name out of it.

## Man holds a sign that says OK Are Not Militia

Unknown speaker: They’re the ones who originally called OK a militia

SR: Right. And originally they put that in the affidavit as justification for taking their kid was listing his association with us. We issued a demand letter on behalf of all the police in our organization, saying that especially for them it’s outrageous. It’s a horrible insult to them to insinuate that associating with them as police officers somehow endangers children. 

## Video jumps at 0:05:44.0

SR: They don’t like the fact that we’re talking to current serving police and military. They don’t like us handing out Sheriff Mack’s book. We gave a copy to the sheriff here today. Turns out he’d already read it. They don’t like that. They don’t want police and military to start thinking about and taking seriously their obligations under the law to obey the supreme law of the land, the Constitution. They find that threatening, so they want to attack it any way they possibly can. They attack Ron Paul, all he does is talk about the Constitution. But they attacked him in the MIAC report, insinuated that, the SPLC literally wrote it pretty much, they said these are, the MIAC report was largely influenced by the SPLC. In that report they said the SPLC looked at these people and said Chuck Baldwin supporters and Ron Paul supporters are all potential security threats, potential terrorists. (0:06:32.2) Same thing with us. They don’t like what we’re doing. They don’t care for Ron Paul. They can’t say Ron Paul is a constitutionalist, that’s why we don’t like him. They have to insinuate that him and his followers might spark violence. Same goes for us. 

Unknown speaker: Do you think this is a scare tactic to keep young people from joining the group?

SR: I don’t know. The problem is, this is why you can’t. Sure, it’s potential this is a scare tactic to keep young people from joining our group, I don’t know for sure. Here’s the problem with that. You don’t allow the targeting of someone’s speech for government action against them because it could be, it could lead to a chilling of speech and it could be used for the targeting of the content of speech. You just can’t allow it. When you allow the government to start going after someone at least in part because of their political associations, they’re targeting the protected speech of the individual, the content of their speech. That’s unconstitutional for very good reasons. Long lines of Supreme Court cases saying it’s unconstitutional for the government to target your content of your speech. If you’re committing a crime, doing something that’s physically endangering a child for example, that’s different. But to put down your associations, your above-board legal associations and freedom of speech as a reason, is absolutely unconstitutional and illegitimate. That’s why in my first article about this, I pointed out that the line between protected speech and unprotected speech is the incitement of imminent violence. Unless you’re inciting imminent violence, it’s protected speech. How can protected speech be listed as a reason to take someone’s child away? (0:08:15.5) If you allow that, you have no more freedom of speech, you have a drastic chilling of speech across the country. You’ll have parents everywhere afraid to join this group or that group. It could be a leftist group, it could be they’re afraid to join ANSWER or Code Pink or some other anti-war group. They might be afraid to join the Earth Liberation Front, or even PETA. It could be a conservative judge they get in front of. So far, here in New Hampshire, the DCYF’s response has been we just throw in anything the judge should know and let the judge decide what’s relevant. That’s kind of like throwing up against the wall, piles of spaghetti, whatever they can get to stick, see what the judge wants to grab ahold of. What if you get a judge who doesn’t like gun owners? You throw up the fact this guy is a gun owner. Or that he was associated with OK by being a member of the forum. If it’s a liberal you don’t like, say you’re in front of a conservative judge, you throw out the fact that this guy is a member of NORMAL, wants to legalize marijuana, or he’s a medical marijuana user, or even just advocates legalization of marijuana, or is an anti-war protestor. And a judge could look at that and go yeah I find that relevant. That’s ridiculous. You can’t have a court system that lets you throw out the political associations willy nilly against the wall and let the judge pick and choose what he wants to use. What is that? You’re going to get wild suppression and chilling of speech. That can’t happen in America.

Alex Jones: [00:00:02] I'm making the new Obama film, making I mean new the Obama deception plan is number one out there, will be out on July 4th. and it's going to have the great folks, the Oath Keepers, I was thinking about going and interviewing Edwin Vieira the doctor and a few others for it and I just thought I'm too busy we got enough interviews. But I knew there was something else needed to be added and I was going to send folks to some Tea Parties. But now I know this is key. This is key. And so I'm very very excited about that. And hey guys I want you guys to decide who's going to go, then you go and get plane tickets. It's on April 19th on that Sunday. And I want you to talk to Edwin Vieira. I want you to go ahead and talk to them and set up times interview at their hotel, the night before or the day after. 

Alex Jones: [00:00:47] And we'll also interview the amazing Stewart Rhodes for the film, because I'm trying to make the films about other people other than myself. But then it's always me out doing the activism. I'm going to attempt to probably just because I'm frankly the film sell better if I'm in them. Everybody told me that. But this one probably won't have Alex Jones or a voiceover. Well kind of a little bit of me doing a voiceover, where I'm a little pop in on video but not a lot of Alex is the point. And so we're on, we're on. we're going to send somebody. I'm going to have at least two of my guys up there and we'll get all that down we're gonna call Dr. Riviera and get all that lined up as well. 

Alex Jones: [00:01:25] But I look, Stewart Rhodes, I'll have you back up in the next few weeks as this builds. give people the details again from the Web site. police and military coming in pledging and mass publicly. They can do it incognito with a pseudonym. I'm saying I'm going to uphold the Bill of Rights, Constitution. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:01:41] That's Oath Hyphen keepers dot blogspot dot com. And we've got a brand new video out our 10 orders will not obey on video it's on YouTube right now. Please send it around. And also we could use our user support. We run pretty lean and about like outpacing our own supply line, kinda like Patton did. But we could definitely use some support to help pay for our efforts. What I wanted to tell you. We Will be there both days. Oath Keepers will be there Saturday and Sunday and we're going to have a breakfast and a dinner and everyone's invited. So let's come on out. 

Alex Jones: [00:02:14] Well I'm going to have my crew there and so set aside a time for us to interview you for about an hour or so in your hotel room. or in a conference room with a lot of noise and we need interview Dr. Edwin Vieira, everybody else. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:02:26] And Dan Epps is going to be there. and Jill Bonnick, the legislators who sponsored some of the sovereignty initiatives are going to be are going to be there as well. 

Alex Jones: [00:02:35] OK. Do me a favor would you send me will you send me all you want to go, OK we're going to send Rob Dew and Bermous. Will you do me a favor will you. I'm sending Erin to Kansas City this weekend for an interview. This film got a lot of cool interviews and it. do me a favor will you e-mail Rob Dew all those guys contacts so that we can have the interviews lined up before we get there. Because it'll be, but it won't happen if we show up on they're busy shaking hands for two hours and try to get the interviews and then it's all pointless. Well very very exciting and people should go to the site and read the 10 things you will not do, because those are all the things that are being asked to be done. Can you believe all these liberal sites and I was just given more mainstream newspapers attacking me including the New York Times, are saying we're making it up that Obama wants to restrict guns. when he says oh I'm for the second amendment, we're not going to ban this is a quote We're not going to ban all the guns overnight we're just going to restrict him incrementally. And his chief of staff and attorney general are for total gun bans on record. I mean how can they just keep lying and saying I'm not for this as they do it. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:03:38] Well is this part of the strategy. It's like this, this Marcion guy I went with this to you real quick. He says I don't think American soldiers would hesitate to kill Americans. They're are a very professional force. And then he said after the demonization job that will be done by the media, Americans will be positively demanding airstrikes on their own cities. That's what he said. 

Alex Jones: [00:03:57] Communist always and socialists are always real cold blooded into the Machiavellian mind and that and then and they just love getting in a power position and imagining what they do. Oh we would and we demonize the owners, then we get air strikes them and got so close to getting these gun owners. We're so close to bombing our their families. Oh god I got foundation money and Soros money. We're butchering America, the global taxes here. we stalled the people long enough. We're so close to turn to military and police against our people it's going to be so good. We can't wait to destroy America. Yes. So good. 

Alex Jones: [00:04:37] We have to believe we can fight the new world order. We have to believe we can have victory. Now you're going to see the COINTELPRO operatives and their. Unwitting dupes, who are just conned. You've seen this from Rolling Stone and in other books and magazine articles that I've seen over the years, where they're when they're claiming oh my god the Republican Party has you know right wing militias that want to overthrow the government and kill everybody. That's George Soros propaganda. And so he was just mentioning that's what made me think of our guest Stewart Rhodes worked with the Ron Paul campaign at the highest levels is now spinning off doing this. Saying to the police the military Hey join the Republic, join the Bill of Rights. We're the good guys. We're not the Republican Party. We're not the Democratic Party. You know they claimed I worked for the Democrats secretly when I was attacking Bush Vice versa. 

Alex Jones: [00:05:29] We are trying to get the military and police to defend the Bill of Rights, Constitution, not fire on Americans, not getting shootouts with law abiding citizens, not have gun confiscations, not have secret arrests of citizens. All the things that are now admitted that are going on, they're trying. Who could say that isn't a wholesome good thing, to have them up keep their oath. Well George Soros and their crowd are hopping mad because believe me we are the resistance. You want to know who's resisting this new world order. you want to know who's are the tip of the spear, who's affecting change in and and who they're worried about. That's why we have Republicans and Democrats. you have Glenn Beck saying the FEMA camps aren't real, we're all kooks. Now arrest Ron Paul supporters. but then he's still our best friend. You've got all the big liberal sides doing it and their own members are posting the majority of comments are countering, and going no no Alex Jones is good. You know he's he calls for nonviolence. as they go Jones says kill cops. This isn't going to work. And any body you hear putting that out is an operative is. you want to know instantly who an operative is that's how you know. Going back briefly is Stewart Rhodes I appreciate doing what he's done. Look he's taken up the mantle taking up the leadership, energizing and having a huge effect. Tens of thousands of police and military on record saying we, and sending in their photos or sending in the picture of their ring, they can be public or not public. A lot of them want to be public saying, we're not going along and then we're in the mainstream, we're the majority, we are the Constitutionalist. That's why the feds bombed Oklahoma City was to put a chilling effect in the Patriot Movement and claim we did it. Well we're not even calling this a patriot movement. This is a constitutional movement against tyranny. And you notice the operatives are going to say we're violent and seize on any opportunity to frame us and cast us that way. It isn't going to work. The police and the military are now understanding. They want to get a war started between the American people because a divided House cannot stand. We got to come together for the bill of rights and Constitution. Do you stand with George Washington and Thomas Jefferson and the founding fathers. Or do you stand with George Bush and George Soros and Barack Obama and Zbigniew Brzezinski. They're demonizing us. What does that tell you. In closing tell folks about the Web site when the event is April 18th and April 19th. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:07:45] You betcha we are oath dash keepers, which is the oath hyphen both hyphen keepers blogspot dot com. and you can go there and read testimonials from active duty military, retired, and police. We are rallying on the green on Lexington on April 19th. We will actually be there Saturday the 18th and on Sunday the 19th of April in Lexington Massachusetts to reaffirm our oaths, to read aloud to the whole world Our Declaration of orders we will not obey and to put it on film and let it go viral and throw down the gauntlet and make it clear to them, we're not gonna play along. 

Alex Jones: [00:08:22] This needs to be mega huge. I want everybody to be there. I might even be there. But because if you want to give out our trade secrets. folks notice i usually show up unannounced places. we do that for a reason believe me it's not tell folks the stuff that goes on around here. It's an it's an action adventure movie. Let's just say it's not boring. I may come there. I may do that. I just don't want to have my hotel robbed so I don't announce what I'm doing. The point is is that we are taking action. Ladies and gentlemen I will have people there be there the 18th and 19th again give folks the town the place. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:08:55] You betcha. Lexington Massachusetts. We'll be right there on the Lexington green. All them on the from 12 noon to 3 p.m. on the 19th of April right with the first shot was fired. But we're also going to have other events going on all weekend.

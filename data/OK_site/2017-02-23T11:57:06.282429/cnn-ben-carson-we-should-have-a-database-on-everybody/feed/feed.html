<content:encoded>Can we get a link to see the statement in its entirety?
<p>The media says similar things and posts them out of context. </p>
<p>I am still undecided but decide for myself. </p>
<p>I would like to see this statement and if this was said about all Americans ten that is one thing. If it is about all  non citizen immigrants then hat is another. </p>
<p>Looking for the truth. </p>
<p>That is all.</p>

<content:encoded>Yes, Storm N1 I think that if a non politician  were to be a good honest man that wants the best for America and wants to follow the Constitution, then he needs to surround himself with like minded folks that know  the facts and to help him in the right way to go. Lord let’s hope he wouldn’t be suckered to get a Grant type administration though his was probably better then anything in the last 100 yrs.I think the former wanted to line their pockets, and the later to bring down the Republic.

<content:encoded>Gentle Ben is a well-meaning man, IMO. He just sees one side of the coin. I realized this when he recently talked about how a flat tax was the fair answer to our income tax inequities – if only Irwin Schiff had known! (sarcasm).
<p>If Ben Carson is to do a good job as president he will have to learn on the job. That’s too many mistakes, too expensive and dangerous for me.</p>

<content:encoded>Excellent summation, Stewart.
<p>Now we all know that he is just another shill put into place to assist in the destruction of our legitimate government.  </p>
<p>Truly, we have no “candidates” that are not put into place anymore. </p>
<p>“Because that is the oath he will take if elected president – to do whatever it takes to protect us, so long as we are all treated the same.”</p>
<p>But that is NOT the Oath he is REQUIRED to take and keep.  These are the words of the Oath all US Presidents are required to take and keep:</p>
<p>“I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will faithfully execute the Office of President of the United States, and will to the best of my ability, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.”</p>
<p>I know that you are aware that executing the delegated duties that come with the office of the US President are do the duties as the US Constitution requires, not as those who also temporarily served as the US President did, nor as foreign nations or others require of them.  They are also to Preserve, Protect, and Defend the US Constitution – and it does need defended. </p>
<p>All duties of those who serve within our governments do not belong to the person serving, but are delegated in writing to the branch or to specific named positions.  The person serving is ALLOWED to use that autority/powers that come with the branch or position for as long as they keep the Oath throughout the disignated term.  I believe that once they break the Oath – besides being a felony and the crime of Perjury – they no longer meet the conditions of the position they occupy.</p>

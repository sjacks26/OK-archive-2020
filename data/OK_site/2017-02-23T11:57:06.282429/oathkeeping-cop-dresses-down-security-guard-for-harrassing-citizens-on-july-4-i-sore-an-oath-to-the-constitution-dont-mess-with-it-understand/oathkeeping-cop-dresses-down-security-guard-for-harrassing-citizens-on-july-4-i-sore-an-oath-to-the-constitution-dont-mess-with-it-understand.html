<p>We now have a clear candidate for Oath Keepers Peace Officer of the Year.</p>
<p>In the below video, a true oath-keeping peace officer stands up for the rights of Americans on the Fourth of July, 2015, by dressing down and warning a security guard to not mess with the Constitution that the officer swore an oath to defend.</p>
<div class="video-container">
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="615" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AdC2wfsNMLg?rel=0" width="820"></iframe>
</div>
<p>In the video, the officer can be heard to say:</p>
<blockquote><p>He Lives Here …  Alright?  He’s watching fireworks.  It’s Independence Day, alright?  <strong>There’s a Constitution that I swear an oath to, so don’t freaking mess with it with these citizens, you understand me? </strong></p>
<p>I know you’re not subjected to the Constitution when it comes to your job, but don’t mess with it.</p>
<p>They have a right to their property, they have a right to not be searched by anybody, you understand that?  They have a right not to be accosted.  He lives here.</p>
<p><strong>I swore an oath to the Constitution.</strong>  I’m  not … <strong>Don’t mess with it.   You understand?</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Simply OUTSTANDING.  This officer is a fantastic example of a true “peace officer” who takes his oath to the Constitution seriously.  I am  going to nominate him for Oath Keepers Peace Officer of the Year.   This is the kind of officer we need on the streets – one who understands his oath, understands the rights of the people, and is committed to defending the Constitution.   It appears the officer is dressing down a security guard, not another cop, since he says “I know you’re not subjected to the Constitution when it comes to your job.”   Private security guards don’t have to swear an oath as a condition of their employment (though they are still legally liable if they violate citizens’ rights).  But it is still OUTSTANDING.   What a way to celebrate Independence Day.  God bless him and his family.  They have reason to be proud of him, and so does his department and community.  Please leave a comment in the Youtube video, thanking this officer for laying down the law – the Supreme Law of the Land – to that security guard.</p>
<p>This is exactly what all officers need to do, and they need to do it whether they are witnessing abuse by security guards, by other police, or by federal agents, bureaucratic weenies, or politicians – <em>anyone</em> who violates the Constitution and the rights of the people needs a public dressing down like this.</p>
<p><em><strong>I swore an oath to the Constitution.  DON’T MESS WITH IT.  Understand?</strong> </em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Priceless.   Go get em.’</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">For the Republic,</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Stewart Rhodes</p>

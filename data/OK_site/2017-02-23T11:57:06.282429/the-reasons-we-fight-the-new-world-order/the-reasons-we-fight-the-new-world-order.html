<p><em><strong>“Countless people … will hate the new world order … and will die protesting against it.” </strong>— </em><em>H.G. Wells, The New World Order (1940)</em></p>
<p>Throughout our lives and throughout our culture, we are conditioned   to rally around concepts of false division. We are led to believe that   Democrats and Republicans are separate and opposing parties, yet they   are actually two branches of the same political-control mechanism. We   are led to believe that two nations such as the United States and Russia   are geopolitical enemies, when, in fact, they are two puppet   governments under the dominance of the same international financiers.   Finally, we are told that the international bankers themselves are   somehow separated by borders and philosophies, when the reality is all   central banks answer to a singular authority: <a href="http://www.edwardjayepstein.com/archived/moneyclub.htm" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.edwardjayepstein.com/archived/moneyclub.htm', 'the Bank Of International  Settlements (BIS)');" target="_blank">the Bank Of International  Settlements (BIS)</a>.</p>
<p>We are regaled with stories of constant conflict and division. Yet   the truth is there is only one battle that matters, only one battle that   has ever mattered: the battle between those people who seek to control   others and those people who simply wish to be left alone.</p>
<p>The “New World Order” is a concept created not in the minds of   “conspiracy theorists” but in the minds of those who seek to control   others. These are the self-appointed elite who fancy themselves grandly   qualified to determine the destiny of every man, woman and child at the   expense of individual freedom and self-determination.  Such elites are  often very open about their globalist intentions and ambitions, much  like author H.G. Wells, a socialist member of the Fabian Society and  friend to the internationalist establishment who put forth his blueprint  for world governance in the book quoted above.  In this article, I   would like to examine the nature of our war with the elite and why   their theories on social engineering are illogical, inadequate and, in   many cases, malicious and destructive.</p>
<p><strong>The ‘Greater Good’</strong></p>
<p>I have always found it fascinating that while elitists and NWO   champions constantly proclaim that morality is relative and that   conscience is not inherent, somehow they are the ones who possess the   proper definition of the “greater good.” If “good” is in all cases   relative, then wouldn’t the “greater good” also be entirely relative?   This inconsistency in their reasoning does not seem to stop them from   forcing the masses through propaganda or violence to accept their   version of better judgment.</p>
<p>As many psychologists and anthropologists (including Carl Jung and   Steven Pinker) have proven over decades of study, moral compass and   conscience are not mere products of environment; they are inborn ideals   outside of the realm of environmental influences. The greater good is   inherently and intuitively felt by most people. Whether one listens to   this voice of conscience is up to the individual.</p>
<p>It is no accident that NWO elites end up contradicting themselves by  claiming morality to be meaningless while pronouncing THEIR  personal  morality to be pure. In order to obtain power over others,  they must  first convince members of the public that they are empty  vessels  without meaning or direction. They must convince the masses to  ignore  their inner voice of conscience. Only then will the public  sacrifice  freedoms to purchase answers they don’t really need from  elites who  don’t really have them.</p>
<p><strong>Collectivism</strong></p>
<p>I don’t claim to know what ideology would make a perfect society, and   I certainly don’t know the exact solutions needed to get there. What I   do know, though, is that no one else knows either. Whenever anyone  takes  a stage to announce that only he has the answers to the world’s   problems, I cannot help but be suspicious of his motives. Rarely, if   ever, do I hear these people suggest that more liberty and more   individualism will make a better future. Instead, their solution always   entails less freedom, more control, and more force in order to mold   society towards their vision.</p>
<p>The utopia offered by the power elite invariably demands a   collectivist mindset that the individual must give up his   self-determination and independence so the group can survive and thrive.   The problem is no society, culture or collective can exist without the   efforts and contributions of individuals. Therefore, the liberty and   prosperity of the individual is far more important than the safety or   even existence of the group.</p>
<p>The elites understand this fact, which is why they do reserve some individuality (for their own tiny circle).</p>
<p>No matter the guise presented — whether it be socialism, communism,   fascism or some amalgamation of each — the goal is always the same:   collectivism and slavery for the masses and unrestrained gluttony for   the oligarchs.</p>
<p><strong>The Philosophy Of Force</strong></p>
<p>If your idea of a better society is a good and rational one, you   should not need to use force in order to get people to accept it. Only   intrinsically destructive ideas require the use of force to frighten the   public into compliance. The NWO is an idea that relies entirely on   force.</p>
<p>Globalization has been consistently sold to us as part of the natural   progression of mankind, yet this “natural progression” is always   advanced through the use of lies, manipulation, fear and violence. The   NWO concept is one of complete centralization, a centralization that   cannot be achieved without the use of terror, for who would support the   creation of a malicious global power authority unless he was terrorized   into doing so?</p>
<p>The only morally acceptable use of force is the use of force to   defend against attack. As the NWO relentlessly presses forward its   attack on our freedoms, we, the defenders, are labeled “violent   extremists” if we refuse to go along quietly. The NWO’s dependency on   force to promote its values makes it an inherently flawed methodology   derived from ignorance and psychopathy, rather than wisdom and truth.</p>
<p><strong>Dishonesty As Policy</strong></p>
<p>As with the use of violence, the use of lies to achieve success   automatically poisons whatever good may have been had through one’s   efforts. The elites commonly shrug off this logic by convincing each   other that there is such a thing as a “noble lie” (both Saul Alinsky and   Leo Strauss, the gatekeepers of the false left/right paradigm,  promoted  the use of “noble lies”) and that the masses need to be misled  so that  they can be fooled into doing what is best for themselves and  the world.  This is, of course, a sociopathic game of  self-aggrandizement.</p>
<p>Lies are rarely, if ever, exploited by people who want to make the   lives of other men better; lies are used by people who want to make   their <em>own</em> lives better at the expense of others. Add to this   the egomaniacal assertion that the elites are lying for “our own good”   when they are actually only out to elevate their power, and what you get   is a stereotypical abusive relationship on a global scale.</p>
<p>Methodologies that have legitimate benefits to mankind deliberately   seek truth and do not need to hide behind a veil of misinformation and   misdirection. If a methodology requires secrecy, occultism and deceit in   order to establish itself in a culture, then it is most likely a   negative influence on that culture, not a positive one.</p>
<p><strong>The Hands Of The Few</strong></p>
<p>Why does humanity need a select elite at all? What purpose does this   oligarchy really serve? Is centralized power really as efficient and   practical as it is painted to be? Or is it actually a hindrance to   mankind and an obstacle in our quest to better ourselves? Champions of   the NOW argue that global governance is inevitable and that sovereignty   in any form is the cause of all our ills. However, I find when I look   back at the finer points of history (the points they don’t teach you in   college textbooks), the true cause of most of the world’s ills is   obviously the existence of elitist groups.</p>
<p>The “efficiency” of centralization is useful only to those at the top   of the pyramid, because it generally stands on a vast maze of   impassable bureaucracy. It has to. No hyper-condensed authority   structure can survive if the citizenry is not made dependent on it.   Centralization makes life harder for everyone by removing our ability to   provide our own essentials and make our own choices. That is to say,   centralization removes all alternative options from the system, until   the only easy path left is to bow down to the establishment.</p>
<p>I have never seen a solid example of centralization of power   resulting in a better society or happier people. I have also never come   across a select group of leaders intelligent enough and compassionate   enough to oversee and micromanage the intricate workings of the whole of   the Earth. There is no use for the elite, so one must ask why we keep   them around?</p>
<p><strong>The Opposite View</strong></p>
<p>Arguing over what should be done about the state of the world is a   fruitless endeavor until one considers what should be done about the   state of his own life. As long as men are stricken by bias, selfish   desire and lack of awareness, they will never be able to determine what   is best for other people. The opposing philosophy to the NWO, the   philosophy of the Liberty Movement, holds that no one has the right to   impose his particular version of a perfect society on anyone else. As   soon as someone does, he has committed a grievous attack against   individual liberty — an attack that must be answered.</p>
<p>Our answer is simply that the people who want to control others be   removed from positions of control and that the people who want to be   left alone just be left alone. Association and participation should   always be voluntary; otherwise, society loses value. This is not anarchy   in the sense that consequence is removed. Rather, the rights of the   individual become paramount; and the liberties of the one take   precedence over the ever vaporous demands of some abstract group.</p>
<p>The most common retort to this principle of valuing the individual  over collective fear is that “someone” must apply and enforce a  structure of law and accountability, otherwise, society will “fall  apart” into a vortex of madness and chaos.  And perhaps that is true,  though self-governance has never been allowed to exist in the history of  man without immediate interference from elitist groups, so no one  really knows for certain what would happen.</p>
<p>Doing away with overt government control, however, does not mean we  do away with “law”.  Natural law, as with conscience, exists in our very  biological and spiritual being, and does not require a central  authority in order to be defined.  Natural law supersedes the laws of  men.  In fact, the only man-made laws worth following are derived from  natural law.  The primary tenet of natural law is that no one has the  right to impede or erode the inherent liberties of other individuals, as  long as they also respect natural laws.  The second any person violates  the inborn rights of another, he has committed a trespass against  natural law.  His trespasses against government authority are secondary,  if not meaningless.  When one understands the unassailable existence  and preeminence of natural law, he quickly discovers how trivial  governments really are.</p>
<p>The ONLY reason for any government to exist is to safeguard   individual freedom. Period. The original intent of America’s Founding   Fathers was to establish a Nation that fostered this ideal. When   government or oligarchy steps outside the bounds of this mandate, it is   no longer providing the service it was originally designed for; and it   must be dismantled. Unfortunately, it is a universal rule that   uncompromising tyranny must often be met with uncompromising revolution.</p>
<p>When a new system arises that cannibalizes the old, enslaves our   future, uses aggression against us and mutilates our founding principles   in the name of arbitrary progress, that new system must be defied and   ultimately destroyed. The NWO ideology represents one of the most   egregious crimes against humanity of all time, posing in drag as our   greatest hope. It is based, fundamentally, on everything that makes life   terrible for the common man and everything our inherent conscience   fights against.</p>
<p>We would be far better served as a species if we were to turn our   back on the NWO altogether and move swiftly in the opposite direction.   Imagine what tomorrow would be like if there were no controllers, no   statists, no despots and no philosopher kings. Imagine a tomorrow where   people respect the natural-born rights of others. Imagine a tomorrow   where people’s irrational fears are not allowed to inhibit other   people’s freedoms. Imagine a tomorrow where interactions between   citizens and government are rare or nonexistent. Imagine if we could   live our days in peace, independently building our own destinies, in   which our successes and failures are our own, rather than the property   of the collective. It may not be a perfect world, or a utopia, but I   suspect it would be a much better place than we live in today.</p>

## Infowars-branded video. Rhodes, Michael Boldin (found of Tenth Amendment Center), and Jones sitting at a table. Brandon Smith takes Boldin’s seat at the table after a while; he isn’t described as affiliated with OK. Smith and Boldin described as Rhodes’s associates.

## As usual, there’s this assumption of nefarious motives throughout. Around 44 minutes, they’re talking about state power and Jones mentions school lunches. He talks about it as if this is just a power grab from power hungry people, as if it couldn’t be someone who thinks they can do some good and in doing so goes overboard.

## Video titled “The States Strike Back: Rise of the Republic with Stewart Rhodes and Alex Jones” (0:01:21.1)

AJ: First show in new studio. SR, founder of OK, short bio. OK has educated “hundreds of thousands of military and millions of veterans” (0:02:05.8). Many historians have said tyranny is gonna come to your door in a uniform. Look at E Germany. Time and time again, it’s either the military that oppressed the people or that stood down and allowed liberty to win the day. Anybody who has studied history or has common sense knows we’re losing our basic liberties in this country. Boldin from the 10th Amendment Center defining what 10th amendment nullification is, not the demonization from Soros and the private Federal Reserve that has hijacked our government (0:03:14.0).

AJ: Why do we need OK? What are the 10 orders? Why did you found this org?

SR: Critical thing: tyranny can either come in the uniform or die by the uniform. If the military withdraws its support, the tyrant – no matter how bloodthirsty – cannot do it without them. Reference to E Germany. (0:04:03.6) We have a video on our website of a former E German Lieutenant Colonel who’s now a TX OK who was there when the wall fell. The same thing just happened in Tunisia: when the military refused to fire on the people, the dictator was forced to flee the country (0:04:51.5). First part of our mission is to reach the current serving, remind them of their oath. We have a clear set of rules in our Bill of Rights (0:05:04.0). That’s why we have our declaration of orders we will not obey, which are just a restatement of the Bill of Rights. We were never taught these things in school, they intentionally dumb us down in public schools and don’t teach us our own heritage and our own Constitution. We’re gonna fix that. We’re gonna teach the troops what they should know, they already have the courage and honor. If they have the knowledge, they’ll do the right thing. (0:05:32.7)

AJ: You’ve had a huge effect in the couple of years. The big indicator that you’ve hit a nerve is that the federal government, the SPLC, the ADL, the George Soros type groups, Rachel Maddow, they have attacked you. All you’re saying is, police and military, read the Bill of Rights and the Constitution, study the country. In the past, courses were taught that the president isn’t a dictator, Congress declares war, etc. Coming out of WW2, we saw Nuremberg. Common law understanding that just following orders doesn’t cut it came to the fore. (0:06:52.5). I can’t tell one of my employees to go rob a store and expect the police to be okay with that. The vast majority of people join the military for the right reasons, some join to be a tough guy. The system picks out those sociopathic type, in law enforcement too (0:07:26.0). Military and police are some of the best people in America, you’ve found the Achilles heel of the system. (0:07:46.0) From your constitutional law and veteran perspective, let’s talk about why tyranny is coming now, why now’s the time to reach out to military and police, for them to make a decision which side of history to be on. (0:08:08.2)

SR: Since WW2, but even before then, there’s been the creation of infrastructure of totalitarianism in the US. Look at the claimed power of the president to intern any American citizen as an unlawful enemy combatant, no indictment, no jury trial, just a brig and a kangaroo court (0:08:33.0) of officers selected by the president. FDR, Lincoln, Supreme Court said it was unconstitutional, but FDR tried to do it again. New Deal SC rubber stamped his authority to bring the international laws of war home. Bush grabbed the same claimed power and expanded it even more in War against Terrorism. SC rubber stamped that in Hamdi decision. Obama went even further, you won’t even be detained, just assassinated by drones, any US citizen he thinks is an unlawful combatant (0:09:32.9). He has a secret list of Americans he wants to kill, says the SC can’t even see his list, no one can see his list, we must trust him to pick targets. Fundamental problem is that they’re saying they can treat an American like a foreign enemy. (0:09:51.1) As though you were an Iraqi or Afghani on the battlefield, they’re saying they can use the same power here in the US.

AJ: We’ll talk about this more later. Earlier, we were talking about Bernard von NotHaus who has made his own private currency for 13 years, totally legal, you have the US Code in front of you. They convicted him with a kangaroo federal jury, of counterfeiting. Accused him of being a domestic terrorist competing with the Federal Reserve, but it is the Fed (0:10:43.0) who is the counterfeiter (the dollar says Federal Reserve Note, it doesn’t say US note, it’s not backed by gold or silver). 

AJ: Since the Patriot Act was passed, I’ve seen thousands of headlines about police using Patriot Act for non-terrorism cases. (0:11:18.5) They’re turning our system of checks and balances against the public. Section 802 of the Patriot Act states that it’s for the general public. This is really tyranny, and that’s what OK is there for (0:11:36.2). What do you say to military and police?

SR: I tell them the powers granted to fight Islamic terrorism have been swung inward on us. I use the MIAC report that you helped expose, I use the DHS reports on returning veterans. They can see that the current crop in the White House doesn’t like them. Most police officers are veterans, and they do get it. We have a window of opportunity to deprogram them after the indoctrination of the Bush years. (0:12:20.4) They see that the SPLC’s characterization of current and former military is nonsense. They’re starting to wake up and see that if you talk like the Founding Fathers wanted us to behave, as a free people, you will be demonized, attacked, labeled an enemy of the state and a terrorist. Cops and military understand this. (0:12:50.6)

AJ: There’s a reason police and federal marshals have sent me documents like the MIAC report. They understand how bizarre or Orwellian it is. If you have a Ron Paul sticker, or an American flag, or get us out of the UN, or want to end the private Federal Reserve. (0:13:13.9) It’s indicative of how illegitimate the power structure, the private interests in Washington are, that they see the military and police who are awake as their enemy. They are tyrants, they are criminals (0:13:27.7), they are usurpers. Good, red-blooded American police and military are the enemy of the New World Order. They’re tipping their hand there. Police and military who haven’t seen my information or your information, they really are in the dark. (0:13:47.2) That threat is still there, even if they’re ignorant. That’s why viewers need to send this to everybody you know, to your police chief, to your sheriff. If we can reach out to police and military, show them the history, show them history is repeating itself, it’s a major checkmate to the globalists. (0:14:17.0) Go over the 10 orders you will not follow.

SR: Number 1 is orders to disarm the American people. We saw this in Katrina. When I was on Bill O’Reilly’s show, he said when is this ever gonna happen, I said it just happened, he said of course, it’s a state of emergency, I said a state of emergency doesn’t cancel 2A. The problem is the mindset of mainstream Republicans is that a really bad emergency, we set aside the Constitution. That’s upside down. (0:14:55.5) The point of the Bill of Rights is to be there when we’re afraid, when we’re angry, to stop us when we’re angry. The Bill of Rights is meant to chain us down when we’re afraid. You need 1A, 2A, third and fourth and fifth, especially during war time and emergency, that’s what they’re for. All we’re saying is we will not violate our Bill of Rights. We won’t conduct warrantless searches on American people (0:15:27.0), as the NSA has been doing. That was one of the reasons our forefathers rebelled against the crown, writs of assistance, warrantless searches. We will not detain Americans as unlawful enemy combatants, or subject them to military tribunal. Article 3 of the treason clause mandates a civilian trial and 2 witnesses. That’s the constitutional remedy, not GITMO. We won’t impose martial law or a state of emergency. Article 4 Section 4 says the US government can’t come into a state without being invited by the state. (0:16:15.7)

AJ: I remember going to urban warfare drills, 15 years ago, seeing military role play to fight the American people. I studied enough history to know wow this is treason. This has happened in every other country. I made films like Police State 2000. People say when’s martial law coming, it’s coming when the TSA ignores federal law about radiology and their machines, we don’t care what local prosecutors say, we don’t care if you have a right to your bank account. We’re already being eased into this emergency atmosphere. (0:17:12.6) They’re never gonna call it martial law. We’re being phased in. From my research, Stewart, do you concur?

SR: (0:17:23.3) In part. They’ve claimed through emergency powers of the president, through executive order or fiat, that he can do things that are unconstitutional.

AJ: Or the UN gives him authority to not have to go to Congress for any war.

SR: That’s partly true, but true martial law is the will of the commander on the battlefield (0:17:49.5). They have made this claim, Bush made it when he applied international law to the American people. That means he can treat you as if he was a tank commander in the Iraqi desert and you’re a local.

AJ: There’s a legal precept there. A few years ago, the head of the Air Force said we have to use microwave guns against the American people because under Geneva we can’t use them against foreigners. He was reversing that (0:18:30.1).

SR: Right, he was saying if we can use the laws of war against Americans, then of course we can use them against Iraqis. They’re sweeping away the Bill of Rights. They say they can treat us all as though we were foreign enemies. That was the undercurrent under NSA spying on Americans (0:19:01.2). They said the 4th Amendment, the Bill of Rights doesn’t apply at all to war. This isn’t just an exception to 4A under criminal law, this is a whole new paradigm. 

AJ: We have the drug war and the war on illiteracy. It’s all for a federal power grab. They always use the term war as their excuse for a power grab.

SR: (0:19:26.9) They do that in conventional law too. In the war on drugs, they say we must allow asset forfeiture. Then they use it against a man who was trolling for prostitutes, they took his wife’s car. It’s meant for this particular bad thing, then it expands. The same is going on in the war paradigm. In the normal legal paradigm, they’ve chipped away at the Bill of Rights (0:19:53.2), but now there’s the war paradigm. In WW2, 8 German saboteurs, 1 was a US citizen, came ashore to blow up factories. They tried him by tribunal, which was upheld. That sort dormant, almost forgotten until after 9/11. Bush reactivated that idea. War on Terror, we can use the same power to try any American we accuse of terrorism (0:20:35.6).

AJ: At the G20 a few years ago in Pittsburgh, some of my crew got arrested, the military told the local police that my guys were terrorists and the police came after them. My guys had press badges, interviewing people. They arrested college students, who hadn’t even been demonstrated. The police could find no one in Pittsburgh that dare break their Tiananmen Square type order that no one could be outside day or night. (0:21:08.3) They would just attack the students with enjoyment, and they arrested my guy Rob Dew (sp?). Took him to and old prison, had military and police there, were bringing in some protestors with bags over their heads, and the police were really enjoying this. We got footage across town of kids playing ball at 3, 4 in the afternoon, loudspeakers saying no one is allowed on the streets. We saw older women (0:21:47.3) coming out of stores with bags, and the police doesn’t care that they’ve been shopping and releases police dogs on them. We’re seeing this in Toronto, we’re seeing it in Pittsburgh. We’re seeing it in England, where they’re beating people to death over newspapers. They say no one is allowed to be outside while the banker heads are meeting in this town, the police from all over the country travel there to mix with the military (0:22:13.5) and private contractors. They were snatching protestors randomly to terrorize people, and throwing them into unmarked vehicles, speeding away. If that isn’t martial law, what is? (0:22:26.5)

## At points in that block of speech from AJ, video of police and civs interacting, looks like protests.

SR: They’re behaving as though they’re in a third-world junta. Look to Central America or the Middle East, any place there’s tyranny, that’s the future unless we stand up and stop it.

## The imagined crisis! The imagined future!

SR: One answer is to teach the military and police about the Constitution, get them to stand down. The other is that we have to stand up. (0:22:50.0)

AJ: That’s my question. A lot of military and police are good people, but they get mob mentality and follow orders in Katrina.

SR: Not all of them did. 

AJ: Some said no, and the media didn’t want us to know about that, and that was a beta test. But something like Pittsburgh, the military and police waged war against the people and it was orchestrated to chill political free speech. (0:23:25.5)

SR: They’re being conditioned. They’ve been conditioned for decades to serve under UN command. Only one man, Michael New (sp?) out of his battalion stood up and said no. We’re trying to counter that conditioning. Now they’re being conditioned to do that at home, not just Katrina, but also NORTHCOMM, the 1st combat brigade of the 3rd infantry division is being assigned here at home.

AJ: And assigned (0:23:49.8) to use foreign troops in America.

SR: We had some during Katrina. Mexican troops assisted. You know, you’ve exposed agreements with Canada to bring troops into the US. We see reports all the time of foreign troop activity. A guy in TN called me upset about Canadian vehicles running around, he was a cop, he didn’t know why they were there. 

AJ: (0:24:17.0) 2 years ago, we had a state rep from TN. They had a gaggle of 10 federal agencies shutting down highways. The governor said you can’t do that get out, and Homeland Security said go to hell. We’re talking checkpoints. Paul Watson in northern England, they had Eastern European, Ukrainian troops in an event running checkpoints. This is happening everywhere.

SR: Certainly, they’re conditioning (0:24:43.0), they’re flipping the Founders’ design on its head. They’re taking away the sovereignty and independence of local police departments, they’re making them subservient to DC. They’re sending in military liaisons to condition them to work together.

AJ: Fusion centers. But I interrupted you, you said some people said no at Katrina.

SR: (0:25:04.9) Sheriff Mack and I were doing a tour of Utah and stumbled on this sergeant named Joshua May of the Utah National Guard. We interviewed him and he said in his unit, they were deployed to Katrina, his entire unit refused to comply with any order to confiscate firearms. They went to their commander ahead of time with a preemptive refusal. (0:25:35.2) Commander went to Big Army with that, Big Army came back and said we won’t ask them to do that. Big Army blinked. Why? Because Sergeant May was that one guy who was an outspoken constitutionalist. Officers came to him in the critical moment and said please go talk to the commander. One man in the right place made a critical difference (0:26:11.4).

AJ: One man who’s in the right is a majority.

##WTF

SR: He’s a moral force far outweighing his numbers. There’s an example, because he convinced the rest of his unit to go along, was able to do what Michael New was not able to do. An entire unit stood down. They did not court martial him.

AJ: (0:26:38.0) Speak more about the orders. Whatever else you want to say. Tell us more about operationsleepinggiant.com

SR: The focus there is, we can’t just say to the current serving please don’t violate our rights, while we sit on the couch. Veterans especially, but all Americans, have a duty to stand up and restore the public from the bottom up. All the institutions the Founders intended us to use to be sovereign citizens. We must restore state militias, even to the county level. We must constitute sheriff posses to back up the sheriff. An economic collapse is coming. Veterans have to wake up and take personal responsibility to defend their oath, by strengthening themselves, their communities, and their states to get ready for the coming storm (0:27:43.5). When the collapse comes, if we’re strong in our states and communities, if we’re self-sufficient, there’s no pretext to send in federal troops. Troops will say they don’t need us and they don’t want us.

AJ: That’s right (0:28:07.5). The globalists are counting on us being domesticated and organized chaos. You’re not just making this statement that the collapse is coming. We have the IMF, World Bank documents from 2002. We’ve seen what they’ve done over and over. We know their stated goal. They want a post-industrial world. It’s the Wall Street crowd that’s not free market, waging war against independence. They want vertical integration, they want to consolidate. Explain how important this collapse that we’re already in is. The system is planning to use it as their pretext to totally take over (0:28:47.6).

SR: The IMF chairman has already told us they’re going to replace the dollar as the world reserve currency and use an interim on the way to an official global currency. They’re telling us what they’re going to do. It’s as though we’re on the Titanic, it’s already hit the iceberg, they’re steered us into it, they’re gonna sink the ship – which is our fiat system – and while we’re floundering in the water, they’re gonna show up with the UNN Leviathan. They’ll say come aboard this, it’s your salvation, the next step is a world Federal Reserve. The answer is to get back to the USS Constitution, which is still sea-worthy, old Iron Sides. Let’s get back to that, fix it, sail it home. The answer is get back to the Constitution. That means sound money in our pockets, in our states like Utah just did, revitalizing the military power of the people in our state militias, getting squared away with alternate communications – so when they use the internet kill switch it won’t matter – becoming strong in our states, having strong sheriffs like Sheriff Mack, and strong legislatures who will stand in front of us as a shield and enforce the Constitution. (0:30:22.2) If we don’t preserve our state sovereignty and our national sovereignty right now, if we don’t stand on the principles of the Founding Fathers, if we are suckered in to the world Federal Reserve, liberty will die worldwide. 

AJ: Very well said. (0:30:39.3)

SR: A key provision here is our 5th order: we will not obey any order to invade or subjugate any state that asserts its sovereignty. That is the constitutional solution. 

AJ: Our Founders went through the same garbage we’re going through. (0:31:04.6) Every culture goes through this. Even some of the same banking families we’re now fighting today are the people our ancestors 235 years ago were fighting. 

SR: They gave us the blueprints for resistance. Everything in our Bill of Rights is the answer. Speak out! (0:31:27.1)

AJ: They knew, they built this bear trap for the new world order. They talked about it. The fight is on. Other nations, some have been wealthy and successful, most have not because of tyranny. They never had any of the freedoms we had because of the vision of our forebears. (0:31:47.7) These two ideologies of liberty versus tyranny, the culture of 1984 is colliding with the spirit of 1776. Everybody is at that crossroads. It’s time to choose a side. (0:32:05.0) Research this information, now is the time. Most of you don’t have to give up your lives. People give up their lives for oil for the banker, or to overthrow a dictator 5000 miles away. Why not just stand up and speak to your legislature or chief of police and promote the idea of liberty. (0:32:51.4) We’ve got the winning ideas, we have history on our side. We’re the good guys! As long as we’re bold, as long as we don’t hide our light under a bushel, we can’t be beaten. Tyrants are trying to intimidate us because they’re scared.

SR: That’s right. They want us to fear for our own safety. The answer to fear is love, the strongest power we have is love for our children and our grandchildren. As Thomas Paine said if there is going to be trouble, let it come in my day so my child will have freedom and peace. That’s our answer. Do it for your kids. A woman whose kids are being attacked by a bear, she has no fear, she’ll throw her life away. That’s the spirit we gotta have. That’s what we’re really doing: defending our children and our children’s children (0:33:37.8). Stand on that, fear won’t bother you.

## Video fades to black for a moment, then comes back.

AJ: (0:33:46.8 ) Joined now by Michael Boldin, heads up 10th Amendment Center. SR is traveling the country with MB as part of the Nullify Now tour. Nullification is one of the keys to restoring our government, because the federal government is been usurped by foreign corporate globalist interests. (0:34:28.3) We’ll bring in Brandon Smith to talk about what we can do at the grassroots level. Tell us about nullification. It’s getting demonized. They’re saying this stuff is Satan itself. But when I read the Bill of Rights, the Constitution, the Declaration of Independence, that’s all I hear about. So I guess they’re saying our American system is what’s so devilish.

MB: (0:34:51.1) Well the peace president bombs countries around the world. The drug war rages on. The Patriot Act exists. Bailouts, mandates, regulations, they never seem to end. The Fed prints and prints. We have an essential question, Thomas Jefferson answered this question back in 1798. When government does not follow the rules given to it, that’s the Constitution, what do you do about it? Do you march on DC on September 12? Do you beg federal politicians to limit their own power? Do you go to federal courts and ask federal judges to limit federal power? Do you vote the bums out and hope the new bums will say they don’t want the power you’ve given them? Thomas Jefferson and James Madison both warned us that if the federal government ever became (0:35:46.6) sole arbiter of the extent of its own power, that power would always grow, despite elections, protests, separations of power, or anything else. In 1798, in response to Alien & Sedition Acts, Thomas Jefferson and James Madison wrote Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions. TJ said nullification of the act is the rightful remedy whenever the federal government violates the Constitution, every single time (0:36:18.0). He didn’t say it’s a good idea to say no in our states after we vote people out or go to court. He said we’re supposed to do it as it happened. So nullification, which is the idea of doing anything with our state legislature, or even jury nullification, to render a particular federal law null and void or unenforceable, that’s our duty. (0:36:43.3) We’re not supposed to wait 2-4 years for a new election. We’re not supposed to wait 6 years for a court so some federal judges can give us permission to exercise our rights. We’re supposed to stand up and exercise our rights in our states and communities whether the government wants us to or not. (0:37:03.6) It’s awesome to have someone like Stewart putting this into mainstream discussion. You talked about how this is irritating the mainstream. Just this week Rachel Maddow did a 15 minute special about how people who support the 10th Amendment Center are evil. We must be interested in owning black people because if you want to decentralize…

AJ: But it was states’ rights that first really got abolition going (0:37:45.9)

MB: In our government-run schools, everything’s been twisted around. 

AJ: Don’t want government in our healthcare? Don’t like black people. What does that have to do with that?

MB: (0:37:57.1) They tell us the Civil War was about nullification. Let’s say everything else they say is right, the South wanted slaves and nothing else. What would they have to nullify? The Constitution at the time allowed slavery. They weren’t nullifying anything. SC’s declaration of causes for secession, it’s easy to find, they give a long explanation about the structure of government. The number 1 complaint was that the darn northern states were trying to nullify the fugitive slave act. 

AJ: Anyone who takes even high school history knows that. It’s just a good throwaway line. That was 150 years ago. People need to understand that the federal government is a cash machine for the Fortune 100 that have come in. We have a private central bank. They have used us to fund their operations, as their military force (0:39:05.9). We owe over a thousand trillion dollars, signed on to through derivatives. That’s the issue. The federal government with unfunded mandates is destroying the states. It has gotten involved in everything: what kids eat in school, what road signs look like, in speed limits. They don’t have this business. If you read the Constitution, Bill of Rights, it’s all right there. Go back to 1913, same year they gave us the private Federal Reserve and its taxing system. They also got an amendment passed to take US senators away from the states. Previously, the legislature would vote and have a US senator that was their creature. (0:39:53.0) If they didn’t do what the state said, they were removed. That’s how much power the states had, they controlled the US Senate. But since then, they’ve made them creatures of the Federal Reserve. They’ve taken the power from the states (0:40:23.8) to the federal government, now from the federal government to the globalists. Thank god for nullification, we need to have the states stand up for the rights of the people and cut the head off of the snake.

MB: Pull the rug out from under them. (0:40:39.6) That’s the reality. James Madison was a pretty smart dude. In Federalist #45, he said the powers given to the federal government are few and defined, and those left with the states are numerous and indefinite. Those few are primarily Article 1 Section 8, and clause 3, the Commerce Clause, which they try to twist.

AJ: And if the people don’t like it, they don’t like America. (0:41:00.7)

MB: You hate America if you want the freedom to choose the size of your toilet, or what plant to grow in your backyard and consume, or if you don’t want to go overseas and kill millions of brown people for the elites. It’s really the other way around. More and more people on the grassroots are getting sick and tired of it. (0:41:21.1) They don’t want us to talk about nullification. We’re doing it anyway. 

AJ: Tell us what is nullification and what’s its progress.

MB: Nullification is the idea that when the federal government passes a law – which is really no law at all, it’s a usurpation of power – when they pass a law that violates the Constitution, it’s your duty to do something in your state, whether (0:41:42.2) to pass legislation to reject that as null and void, to prevent its enforcement in your state. It has a lot of progress. People are waking up. 15 states are defying Congress and the SC on medical marijuana. They say we can’t have a plant in our backyard and consume it, we’re doing it anyway. 25 states have rejected the Bush-era REAL ID act. They keep pushing it off. 

AJ: Hundreds of cities are rejecting the PATRIOT Act.

MB: That’s the same concept. (0:42:15.3) We can even go to a local level. 8 states have passed a firearms freedom act that say if you make a gun in your state and you sell it in your state, federal government, get the hell out. 

## Audio cuts out as AJ starts to speak at 0:42:25.5 for a few seconds, video continues. Audio back at 0:42:28.3 with MB

MB: As SR just said, Utah just passed a sound money bill. 10th Amendment Center authors legislation. We have a federal healthcare nullification act to reject not just Obamacare mandates, but the entire idea that the federal government should be involved in healthcare.

AJ: I want to ask both of you. How discredited is Obamacare (0:42:47.8), written by insurance companies, forced 35 million people to buy an overpriced product. Allows the insurance companies to tell doctors what they can and can’t do. Thousands of major companies are given waivers to not have to buy it. SR, you don’t have to be a lawyer to know this, but you’re a constitutional lawyer, is that not true discrimination? What about economic discrimination? If you’re an insider, you give money to a Dem or a Repub, whoever’s in power, you get a waiver, you don’t have to buy this insurance. But the hamburger place next to McDonalds that’s locally owned, they’ve got to get it.

SR: (0:43:37.3) Unfortunately the courts have not found things like that to be unconstitutional, as corrupt as they may be. One federal judge did realize at least that compelling you to buy insurance is unprecedented. They’re not just saying you can’t do something like law usually does. It’s saying you must do something. Even as indoctrinated as federal judges are to believe in expanded power of the state couldn’t swallow that (0:44:04.7).

AJ: That’s like the Soviets. They would say every week on these hours you have to dig ditches. Just like we see in Chicago, parents can’t pack kids’ lunches. We are literally becoming complete vassals.

## Bizarrely enough, that bit about lunches might be true. It’s not a law, but a single principal at a single school prohibited packed lunches for nutrition reasons in 2011.

SR: (0:44:21.6) They’re flipping freedom on its head.

AJ: They’re rushing this power grab so hard, it’s doing the opposite. It’s accelerating an awakening. The control freaks, the statists push for more power, that accelerates our awakening, and on and on. (0:44:47.0) Finish up with where this movement is going.

MB: It’s endless. It’s not left versus right, it’s us versus them, as you know. 

## Audio cuts out again with MB talking and AJ breaking in at 0:44:56.6. Audio resumes at 0:44:57.9 with MB.

MB: They want to keep us in this box. While we fight each other, they take more power and money for themselves, their friends, the GE types, the war profiteers. We’re trying to reject the TSA, the PATRIOT ACT, we’re working on nullifying national healthcare, we’re working on nullifying using state guard troops overseas. Bills to do this are being introduced all over the country, they’ve already passed in places. We’ve seen success in issues like marijuana and the REAL ID Act. 

AJ: It’s a process (0:45:29.4). The states are rediscovering their power.

MB: More and more state reps are contacting us and asking what to do about, say, constitutional tender or we want to grow hemp in Kentucky. Write a bill, or we’ll provide you with a bill, we have tons at tenthamendmentcenter.com for all kinds of issues. We’ll provide a bill, pass it in your state, say we won’t allow federal agents to stop our farmers from growing hemp and if they try to, we’ll arrest them and put them in jail. (0:45:59.7) That’s what we’re seeing all across the country.

AJ: You see Texas saying we’ll keep our coal power plants. Obama couldn’t even get Congress to pass a law, so he ordered his executive branch minions. Texas is fighting that. It’s every day in the news, the fight is on, it’s exciting. Any closing comments?

MB: AJ we need your help (0:46:37.6). You have been in the forefront reporting on state sovereignty and nullification. We need you to keep pushing it. Everytime you talk about it or interview any of the great state reps you’ve had on, we get so much contact. 

AJ: Bottom line, the patriots are getting organized. The system is scared. They know we’ve found one of their major weak spots. (0:47:10.9)

SR: They’re jumping the shark in reaction. Whenever they start labeling someone who is simply growing a pot plant in their backyard as an enemy. Or labeling von NotHaus who simply had sound money in his pocket, as a terrorist, labeling returning veterans as terrorists.

AJ: (0:47:30.5) It lets everybody know we were right. This PATRIOT ACT is for us, it’s tyranny.

SR: And they wake other people up. They become so absurd, they have to, all we’re doing is defending the Constitution.

AJ: They’re absurd tyrants. The absurdity of them defending what they’re doing is becoming Kafka-esque (0:47:51.7). It’s beyond 1984. The White House says we’re gonna hold your passcodes for your computer and bank account, we’re gonna watch everything you do. Even mainstream media said this is absolute police state.

SR: They think they can chill our speech. They think Americans will cower in fear. (0:48:13.7) The exact opposite has happened.

AJ: Truth is Americans have just been decadent and lazy. Once they get roused, they’re ready for a fight. All they’re doing is rousing a sleeping giant. 

SR: They’re swelling our ranks. They’re showing the truth of what we’ve been saying for years, what you’ve been saying for longer. They’re demonstrating it. They’re showing it’s all true. 

AJ: And this guy who put out silver coins, he’s arrested, he’s a terrorist. And marijuana’s terrorism. And yeah we have blimps watching you and yeah we’re listening to you, but it’s not a police state. But you said 5 years ago you weren’t spying without warrants. Shut up, conspiracy theorist. (0:48:53.2)

SR: But it’s not gonna work, it’s not gonna suppress us.

AJ: By the way, in that article earlier with the Commerce Secretary, where they had Cato and all these other big groups saying it was a total power grab, an internet kill switch, it’s all in the White House announcement. (0:49:11.8) The Commerce Secretary said you’re a conspiracy theorist. They never intellectually debate us, they just have a throw-away line and say you’re a conspiracy theorist. It doesn’t work anymore. Now we’re gonna bring in Brandon Smith. (0:49:41.4)

## Goes to break for a split second.

AJ: SR, why don’t you introduce Brandon Smith.

SR: BR wrote under the penname Giodorno Bruno on Economics. We’ve posted some of your stuff on Infowars.

BS: You have for a couple years now. (0:49:58.7)

SR: Very good stuff. I could tell he’s a person with sincere belief in freedom, and consistent. And I approached him with the idea of starting a grassroots movement to get people to decouple from the fiat system, to unplug from the Matrix. I lit a fire under him to start the Alternate Market project, now we’re doing it.

AJ: Now this is what Gandhi did (0:50:22.6). Gandhi peacefully said stop buying from the British, stop supporting them, basically don’t serve them when they come in. They’re occupying us, support your local community. This idea is really scaring the system. Before we get into his system, let’s talk about what happened to Bernard von NotHaus. They’re calling this guy, who had a competing currency for 13 years, was not counterfeit, they’re saying it was and they found a moronic federal hand-picked jury to convict him. Break that down. (0:51:08.4)

BS: US Attorney, Anne Tompkins, took a broad statute dealing with making gold and silver currency and interpreted it to mean that any flat metal token or coin was counterfeit. NotHaus made a few mistakes, using certain language that insinuated that he was counterfeiting, but his coins don’t look like legal US tender. (0:51:48.3)

AJ: He was also attacking the Federal Reserve and openly saying we need alternative currencies. And he was going further. 

BS: He initiated a lawsuit against the federal government, right before they raided his org.

SR: But the only thing he did was use the term dollar on his coins and use the dollar sign. I’ve seen that on casino chips in Las Vegas for decades. They took a vague federal statute that used to be used to go after real counterfeiters (0:52:23.5) and now they’re going after him because they don’t like what he’s doing. He’s giving people an alternative of using real money. That’s the real threat. 

AJ: The Federal Reserve note is itself a counterfeit, that’s the real joke here. It’s not like people are counterfeiting silver and gold coins. This is insane. They’re saying he’s a special type of terrorist, this is amazing. 

BS: She said that attempts to undermine the legitimate currency of this country are simply a unique form of domestic terrorism (0:52:59.8). These anti-government activities do not involve violence, but they are as insidious and represent a real danger to the economic stability of the country. We will meet these threats through infiltration, disruption, and dismantling of orgs that challenge the legitimacy of our democratic form of government (0:53:24.1).

AJ: Wow, so by challenging the Federal Reserve that hijacked us a hundred years ago. If you even criticize them, they’re saying you’re an enemy. That sounds like Cass Sunstein.

## WTF? What does Alex Jones have against Cass Sunstein???

SR: China just said they’re gonna arrest people who reveal accurate economic information that might hurt the Chinese economy. Our government is saying the same thing. Using legitimate currency is undermining. (0:53:54.1)

BS: And the NotHaus case was not about counterfeiting. It’s about people using sound money in their communities.

AJ: That competes with the fraudulent Federal Reserve system that’s going the way of the Weimar Republic.

BS: Exactly.

AJ: (0:54:09.2) Break this down and go over your alternative, which is completely decentralized, which this death star system can’t stop.

SR: With Operation Sleeping Giant, we’re telling veterans they should focus on 4 areas. BS with Alternate Market is taking the same message. 4 critical things must be in place for us to survive an economic collapse and be free. 1) food security, emergency comms, emergency medical. Food is the hardest thing to improvise. 2) physical security: neighborhood watches, sheriffs’ posses, real county militia, state security so you don’t need outside intervention from the feds. 3) economic security: ability to barter and trade. 4) state sovereignty (0:55:16.4).

BS: If communities don’t take back their commerce, they will be completely dependent on the Federal Reserve and the dollar. (0:55:38.9) We’re seeing extreme devaluation of the dollar, inflation, most commodities have doubled in the past 2 years. If communities remain hooked to the dollar, they’ll be desperate and they’ll go along with anything the federal government says when the final collapse occurs. We propose that communities take back their commerce, institute local networks of barter and trade. Along with that, sound money and sound money legislation from the state (0:56:14.9).

SR: As individuals, neighborhoods on up, one pillar is public action, going to town council and county government and asking them to use gold and silver, going to state legislature. The other side is work in the private sphere. Families, neighborhoods, coops, farmers’ markets, support local economies, make sure you’re strong even outside of government. Stop shopping at Walmart, shop at a local place instead. (0:56:51.2) Get a list of names to give local shop owners to say we’ll support your store if you start taking silver, for example. You entice them to help you.

BS: A lot of people have taken the first steps, including prepping, storing foods and goods, storing materials for self-defense. This isn’t going to be enough. People need to start building community, looking out for each other (0:57:24.2). The idea of lone wolf survivor is not gonna cut it anymore. People need to get out of their houses, think about working together in communities. It only takes 2 people to start a barter network. Hopefully that grows. (0:57:54.5) We need to attack the problem on multiple levels. We need to go after the Federal Reserve at the federal level. We need to institute 10th amendment legislation at the state level. We need to pursue private barter, private commerce to protect ourselves at the local level. We want people to go to alt-market.com. It’s a networking website, you can meet people in your area who are also interested in bartering, in sound money. You meet with them, you start working with them, maybe you can grow. It doesn’t need to be huge, or you can take it to the state level (0:58:49.8). We want people to start pursuing a state-level barter system. During the Great Depression, CA had 300,000 member barter network. Barter networks pop up after every economic collapse. The problem is the start after, we want people to preempt the collapse we know is coming (0:59:20.9).

AJ: I hope other folks pick up the information you’re sharing and spread it. Nobody can stop an idea whose time has come. This information can save America, can save the Republic, and defeat these globalists. Ideas are bulletproof.

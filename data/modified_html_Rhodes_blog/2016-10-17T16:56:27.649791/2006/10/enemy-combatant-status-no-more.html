<b><span style="font-size: 15;">Introduction: No Greater Threat</span></b></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt;">
No
 greater threat to our Constitution and our Bill of Rights has ever 
existed than the current doctrine of “Enemy Combatant Status” (also 
known as “<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illegal_combatant">unlawful combatant</a>” status).<span> </span>This
 doctrine is like a toxic, poisonous weed that, if not pulled out by the
 roots, will grow to choke and kill the tree of liberty. It threatens to
 wipe out our Bill of Rights and plunge us into a nightmare of military 
supremacy over the civilian power and unchecked executive rule by 
decree, where the courts, rather than serving as defenders of liberty, 
are mere willing administrators of a new Kafkaesque system of indefinite
 military detention and trial. We must fight this doctrine or see our 
freedoms perish, and with them, the last restraints on the U.S. war 
machine. To fight it, we must know the facts of its illegitimate birth 
and silent nurturing at the hands of politicians, generals, government 
lawyers and complicit judges. We must be willing to acknowledge that 
Lincoln, FDR, the New Deal Court, and now even the liberals on the 
current Court have all been willing midwives to this monstrosity. As 
Patrick Henry said, “Whatever anguish of spirit it may cost, [we must 
be] willing to know the whole truth, to know the worst, and to provide 
for it.”</div>
<div align="center" class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: center;">
<b>The <i>Hamdi</i> Decision: A Defeat and Deadly Precedent</b></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt;">
The <a href="http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&amp;vol=000&amp;invol=03-6696&amp;friend">2004 Supreme Court decision</a> in the case of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yaser_Esam_Hamdi">Yasir Hamdi</a>
 has been touted by many, including the ACLU, human rights 
organizations, and the mainstream press, as a victory for civil rights, 
the Constitution, and the rule of law. It is nothing of the sort. While 
the <i>Hamdi</i> majority paid lip service to limits on the executive in
 time of war and to “due process,” it joined Bush as a willing 
accomplice in his current attempt to murder the Bill of Rights.<br/><br/>Apologists
 for the Court point out that Bush did not get all that he wanted. That 
is true. Bush wanted absolute and plenary power to designate anyone, 
citizen or not, an “enemy combatant” and do as he pleased with them – 
detaining, interrogating, even torturing and executing them if he saw 
fit - with no judicial interference at all. Instead, the Court insisted 
that there be some manner of a deferential administrative hearing before
 Bush got to do as he wished. That is the only difference of any 
substance.<br/><br/>Rather than insisting that Hamdi, a U.S. citizen, 
receive all of the protections of the accused which are his due under 
the Bill of Rights, the Court breathed new life and legitimacy into this
 destructive doctrine that had lain around unused and nearly forgotten, 
like a dusty, but still dangerous “loaded weapon,” since the World War 
II <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ex_parte_Quirin">Ex Parte<span style="font-style: normal;"> </span>Quirin</a> </i><a href="http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=us&amp;vol=317&amp;invol=1">decision</a> (1942). The <i>Hamdi</i> Court, citing <i>Quirin</i>,
 stated unequivocally that “[t]here is no bar to this Nation’s holding 
one of its own citizens as an enemy combatant.” According to the 
majority on the Court, the mere labeling of a person as an “enemy 
combatant” removes the shield of the Bill of Rights and replaces it with
 a new judge-created system of minimal administrative process to 
“challenge” that designation.<br/><br/>Under this system, the accused will have none of the procedural protections of our <a href="http://www.billofrights.org/">Bill of Rights</a>:<span> </span>No
 Grand Jury indictment; no trial by jury with its requirement of a 
unanimous verdict of twelve of one’s peers; no possibility of an 
unreviewable acquittal and immunity from further prosecution; and no 
protection against compelled self incrimination. The presumption of 
innocence is gone, as is the requirement of a showing of guilt beyond a 
reasonable doubt. Instead, the government will enjoy a presumption that 
its allegations are accurate. The accused will have the burden of 
proving his innocence, but will have no right to compulsory process of 
witnesses and no right to confront the secret evidence and witnesses 
against him.<br/><br/>At most, according to the <i>Hamdi</i> majority, “a 
citizen held in the United States as an enemy combatant [will] be given a
 meaningful opportunity to contest the factual basis for that detention 
before a neutral decision maker” and access to counsel to assist (as 
best they can) in that hearing. The Court made clear that the definition
 of “a meaningful opportunity” will have to be fleshed out by subsequent
 courts, and a military tribunal may qualify as a “neutral decision 
maker” for that minimal, administrative hearing to determine status. And
 this is touted as a victory. </div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt;">
How
 did we get here? As war is the greatest engine of tyranny known to man,
 it should come as no surprise that like many such usurpations before 
it, this doctrine of absolute power was born in the fires of war.</div>
<div align="center" class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: center;">
<b>The Origin of This Gravest Threat: The Civil War</b></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt;">
Until
 the “war on terrorism” this claimed power of the president to operate 
outside the Bill of Rights was asserted on only two other occasions in 
our history: The Civil War and World War II. In the Civil War, the 
southern states that broke away formed their own nation with a 
constitution, a legislature, a president, an army, and a navy. They 
printed their own money, sent and received ambassadors, etc. The North 
and South exchanged prisoners, followed the laws of war in the treatment
 of POWs, negotiated cease-fires and conducted a formal surrender at the
 end. Only in this anomalous situation of a civil war, where a part of 
the U.S. had broken off, were U.S. citizens from the South treated as 
foreign enemies for purposes of military jurisdiction. There was no way 
to avoid that, as all of the southerners were U.S. citizens till they 
broke away.<br/><br/>However, Lincoln did not just treat the citizens and 
soldiers of the rebel states as the enemy. During the Civil War, more 
than 13, 535 Northern civilians were arrested by the military and at 
least 4,271 of these were tried before military tribunals, with some of 
them being executed. Typical charges were vague accusations of violating
 the laws and customs of war. In one such case, a man was found guilty 
of violations of the laws of war for letting rebels lurk in his 
neighborhood without reporting them. Others were accused of harboring 
rebels or engaging in guerilla warfare. This treatment of northern 
civilians as the enemy is what the Milligan Court ruled unconstitutional
 after the war.</div>
<div align="center" class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: center;">
<b>The Supreme Court Attempts to Kill the Monster in its Infancy</b></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt;">
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ex_Parte_Milligan">Ex Parte Milligan (1866)</a>,
 is a Supreme Court rarity: a decision on wartime powers issued after 
the end of a war, with the Court explicitly conscious that it is 
righting the constitutional ship of state after a storm. The U.S. 
government had charged Mr. Milligan with “Conspiracy against the 
Government of the United States;' 'Affording aid and comfort to rebels 
against the authority of the United States;' 'Inciting Insurrection;' 
'Disloyal practices;' and 'Violation of the laws of war.’</div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt;">
The
 government did not try to argue that Mr. Milligan was in fact a member 
of the Confederate army or a Southern resident, and acknowledged that 
the courts in Indiana were at all times open, and yet the government 
argued that the laws of war still applied to Milligan and that “[a] 
military commission derives its powers and authority wholly from martial
 law; and by that law and by military authority only are its proceedings
 to be judged or reviewed.” Of the Bill of Rights, the government lawyer
 had this to say:</div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt 0.5in;">
These,
 in truth, are all peace provisions of the Constitution and, like all 
other conventional and legislative laws and enactments, are silent 
amidst arms, and when the safety of the people becomes the supreme law. 
By the Constitution, as originally adopted, no limitations were put upon
 the war-making and war-conducting powers of Congress and the President.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt;">
As a fallback argument, the government asserted that:</div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt 0.5in;">
Finally,
 if the military tribunal has no jurisdiction, the petitioner may be 
held as a prisoner of war, aiding with arms the enemies of the United 
States, and held, under the authority of the United States, until the 
war terminates."</div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt;">
Sound
 familiar? We are now hearing exactly the same arguments from the Bush 
administration. This was the precursor to “enemy combatant” status. Here
 was the <i>Milligan</i> Court’s response, in <a href="http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&amp;vol=71&amp;invol=2">its decision</a>, to this attempt to circumvent the Bill of Rights:</div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt 0.5in;">
[E]ven
 these provisions, expressed in such plain English words, that it would 
seem the ingenuity of man could not evade them, are now, after the lapse
 of more than seventy years, sought to be avoided. Those great and good 
men [who wrote the Constitution] foresaw that troublous times would 
arise, when rulers and people would become restive under restraint, and 
seek by sharp and decisive measures to accomplish ends deemed just and 
proper; and that the principles of constitutional liberty would be in 
peril, unless established by irrepealable law. The history of the world 
had taught them that what was done in the past might be attempted in the
 future. The Constitution of the United States is a law for rulers and 
people, equally in war and in peace, and covers with the shield of its 
protection all classes of men, at all times, and under all 
circumstances. No doctrine, involving more pernicious consequences, was 
ever invented by the wit of man than that any of its provisions can be 
suspended during any of the great exigencies of government.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt;">
It is vital that we see clearly that the <i>Milligan</i>
 Court rejected the argument that a U.S. citizen could ever be an 
“enemy.” The Court affirmed the use of military jurisdiction over two 
categories of persons: those in the U.S. military (and in the militia 
when called into service) and the enemy. In the peculiar circumstance of
 the Civil War, the Court had no problem at all with using military 
jurisdiction for detention and trial of the soldiers and even civilians 
of the breakaway South who had effectively renounced their U.S. 
citizenship. However, the Court pointed out that Mr. Milligan was not in
 the military (the Union Army) and was not a resident of one of the 
rebellious states. This is really the same as saying he was not a 
citizen or resident of a foreign nation with which we were at war. It 
did not matter to the <i>Milligan </i>Court what Milligan had done, or 
what laws of war he might have violated. What counted was who he was. If
 he was a northern civilian, he could not be tried by tribunal for any 
actions nor held as a POW or “unlawful combatant” because he just was 
not in one of the two categories of people subject to the military. He 
was a northern citizen who was making war on his nation and aiding the 
enemy. The proper remedy for such is a trial for treason, or at least 
for violation of a statute, before a jury in an Article III court, not a
 military trial.<br/><br/>What the <i>Milligan</i> Court upheld is the 
Constitution’s separation of civilian and military jurisdiction. The 
Founders, and the people who ratified the Constitution, were very 
concerned about overreaching military power. In fact, prior to the 
Revolution, the colonists had even been upset about British soldiers 
being tried by tribunals, rather than civilian juries, for offenses 
committed off duty. The colonists considered such tribunals a violation 
of the rights of Englishmen. The Founders knew the sad English history 
of the abuse of special military and executive courts, such as the 
infamous <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_chamber">Star Chamber</a>, during England’s many upheavals and coups and endeavored to prevent their recurrence.</div>
<div align="center" class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: center;">
<b>The Constitutional Trial Mechanism for Traitors</b></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt;">
The Article III <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article_Three_of_the_United_States_Constitution#Section_3:_Treason">Treason Clause</a>
 provides the only constitutional trial remedy for those who make war 
against their own nation or give aid and comfort to its enemies. Up to 
the Civil War, in every rebellion, from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shay%27s_Rebellion">Shay’s rebellion</a>, to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whisky_Rebellion">Whiskey Rebellion</a>, to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burr_conspiracy#Trial">Aaron Burr’s attempt to raise an Army against the U.S.</a>, to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Brown_%28abolitionist%29#Imprisonment_and_trial">John Brown’s attack</a>
 on Harper’s Ferry, each person tried for their actions of taking up 
arms against their nation or aiding the enemy were tried for treason, 
before a jury, in a civilian court. None of them were brought before a 
military tribunal. If the Founders had intended to give the military 
jurisdiction over such people, what was the point of the Treason Clause?<br/><br/>The unconstitutionality of such military jurisdiction is made all the clearer when we consider the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fifth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution">Fifth Amendment</a>’s
 exception to the requirement of Grand Jury indictment for those in the 
military or in the militia during actual service. What was the point of 
that exception if the President retains a power to deny the protections 
of the Fifth Amendment to any citizen, in the military or not? If the 
President has such an implied power over civilians and the Fifth 
Amendment did not impair it, then surely he retained an implied power to
 use military jurisdiction over his own troops, thus making the 
exception clause superfluous. Apparently the Founders considered the 
clause necessary to preserve military jurisdiction over soldiers because
 the Fifth Amendment would otherwise have wiped out the power. Why would
 the writers of the Fifth Amendment not also feel compelled to carve out
 such a power over citizens who are the enemy if they meant military 
jurisdiction to apply to them? They had no such intention, having 
already provided for trial for treason in Article III. It is absurd to 
assert that the American people, who had only recently thrown off a 
tyrannical government, understood the Constitution and Bill of Rights to
 give presidents the power to set aside their hard won liberties with a 
stroke of a pen. Even the claim that such a power was given to Congress 
is historic revisionism at its very worst.</div>
<div align="center" class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: center;">
<b>The Constitutional Detention Mechanism</b></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt;">
Only the Article I <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suspension_Clause">Habeas Suspension Clause</a>
 that allows for executive preventive detention of civilians in time of 
invasion or insurrection, when the public safety requires it. Habeas 
suspension, which can be done only by congressional statute, denies 
access to the courts altogether. It is truly a draconian denial of due 
process and hence liberty, limited to times of actual invasion or 
rebellion. In fact, I have some strong reservations about the habeas 
suspension clause trumping the Bill of Rights, which came later in time.
 But setting that aside, at least habeas suspension preserves the 
principle of separation of powers, and the integrity of the federal 
courts and the Bill of Rights, which are still intact though 
unavailable.<span> </span>There is no involvement of the 
courts in a watering down of the Bill of Rights that can be normalized 
and made permanent. A person either has full access to courts that must 
enforce the full Bill of Rights or no access to courts at all –not some 
perpetual twilight zone in the middle.<span> </span>In addition, a court could still rule a suspension unconstitutional by finding that there is no invasion to justify it.<span> </span>Lastly,
 such a habeas suspension only allows detention, not trial by tribunal, 
and it also does not “make it legal” for the government to torture 
people, or summarily execute them.<span> </span>The Bill of 
Rights commands preventing such mistreatment are not suspended – just 
the ability to challenge their violations in court.<span> </span>Government
 officials might still be guilty of violating the rights of detainees, 
as Justice Thomas noted in his dissent in Hamdi.<span> </span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt;">
In
 that dissent, Thomas supported the government view in its entirety and 
argued that the habeas suspension clause was not an effective or 
practical alternative to enemy combatant status for Citizens because 
habeas suspension had such an infamous history from its use by Lincoln 
that it would be nearly impossible to secure a suspension in Congress.<span> </span>Justice
 Thomas also noted that government officials could be guilty of 
violating the constitutional rights of detainees, even during a habeas 
suspension.<span> </span>Therefore, Thomas argued, the government needed a more effective tool to fight the “war on terrorism” – enemy combatant status.<span> </span>Evidently, Thomas was not so much concerned with original intent as he was in finding a way to<span> </span>circumvent that original intent, and the entire Bill of Rights, so that government agents <u>could </u>torture detainees, try them before a hand-picked tribunal answerable only to the President, and then execute them.<span> </span><br/><br/>Now,
 with the current Court’s blessing, “enemy combatant” status is a 
perpetual executive detention and military trial power, always in effect
 in this perpetual “war” against terrorism, even when we are not being 
invaded. No lower court in the land can strike these detentions down as 
violations of the Bill of Rights since the Supreme Court has decreed 
that the Bill of Rights no longer applies. Rather than a detainee being 
temporarily denied access to courts which are chomping at the bit to 
protect his liberty with the still intact shield of the Bill of Rights, 
he will be processed through courts which have <i>themselves</i> joined 
his tormenters as part of the machine of detention, military trial, and 
execution by applying some mere administrative standard which is below 
and outside the Bill of Rights. Thus, judges have been drafted to serve 
the executive branch by giving this “process” the gloss of 
constitutionality.<br/><br/>With the current Court’s assistance, the <i>Milligan</i>
 decision has been turned upside down, precisely as if the government 
had prevailed in that case when it asserted that the amendments in the 
Bill of Rights are “peacetime provisions only …are silent amidst arms, 
and when the safety of the people becomes the supreme law... [and b]y 
the Constitution, as originally adopted, no limitations were put upon 
the war-making and war-conducting powers of Congress and the President.”
 The Bill of Rights, as any real barrier to government power in time of 
war, has been effectively written out of the Constitution. We are left 
with only “political” checks on the scope of this "war" power. How is it
 that, after the <i>Milligan</i> Court so emphatically stamped out this pernicious weed, it survived to once again assault our liberties?</div>
<div align="center" class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: center;">
<b><i>Quirin</i>, <i>Korematsu</i>, and the Dark Days of World War II</b></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt;">
Such
 a violation of the Constitution was not repeated until World War II, 
when over 120,000 Japanese-Americans, including citizens and legal 
residents, were <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_American_internment">interned in concentration camps</a>. This dark stain upon our nation was upheld by the FDR appointed New Deal Court in the <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordon_Hirabayashi">Hirabayashi</a></i> and <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korematsu">Korematsu</a></i>
 decisions. While these decisions have never been overruled and are 
technically still good law, they have been “overturned” by near 
universal condemnation in the court of public opinion.<br/><br/>Unfortunately,
 critics of the internment tend to focus on its racial discrimination 
and inequality without seeing that these Americans were being treated 
just as if they were the occupied enemy civilian population of Japan, 
just as <i>Milligan</i> had been treated like the enemy. In fact, 
supporters of the internment justified the imposition of military rule 
over these citizens on the grounds that the necessities of modern 
warfare made obsolete the <i>Milligan</i> decision’s requirement that 
there first be an actual invasion such that the courts were closed 
before the military could have temporary jurisdiction over civilians. It
 should be no surprise that the Bush Administration does not cite to the
 internment decisions though they are certainly “on point.’ Instead it 
cites to another World War II case by the same Court -<a href="http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=us&amp;vol=317&amp;invol=1">Ex Parte Quirin (1942)</a>, which asserts the same principle but has not been repudiated by public scorn.<br/><i><br/>Quirin</i>
 was a one-time, expedient decision to justify the predetermined actions
 of FDR, a very powerful wartime president, who made it very clear that 
he was not going to turn the eight German saboteurs over to civilian 
courts. Whatever the Court decided, FDR intended to convict these men 
before his own hand-picked military tribunal and execute them. In fact, 
by the time the Court wrote its decision, months after oral argument, 
the saboteurs were already dead.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt;">
One
 of the eight German soldiers claimed U.S. citizenship. To make military
 jurisdiction over U.S. citizens “constitutional” the Court butchered 
both the Constitution and the <i>Milligan</i> decision. The <i>Quirin</i>
 Court said that there are certain acts, which while subject to military
 tribunals elsewhere, are not tried by tribunals here in the states and 
it was on such grounds that the <i>Milligan</i> Court had simply ruled 
that Mr. Milligan had not committed acts considered to be violations of 
the laws of war and triable by tribunal.<br/><br/>This wildly misreads the<i> Milligan</i>
 decision. Mr. Milligan had been accused of plotting to kidnap the 
governor of Indiana, break into an Army armory and steal weapons, set 
Southern POWs free, and then spark an insurrection in Indiana so the 
South could invade. The government expressly accused him of violating 
the laws of war. The <i>Milligan</i> decision did not just invalidate 
some narrow use of military jurisdiction for certain acts, it 
categorically denied the use of any such jurisdiction for any offense 
whatsoever for persons who did not fit into the categories of U.S. 
soldiers or the enemy.<br/><br/>While the <i>Milligan</i> decision is concerned with categories of people, Quirin focuses on the actions of the accused. The <i>Quirin</i>
 decision strives to minimize and narrowly define what actions are 
covered by the Bill of Rights, moving from clause to clause as it 
attempts to show that each did not apply to acts in violation of the 
laws of war, when the real focus should have been on whether the person 
in question belonged in the category of the enemy or of a member of the 
armed forces.<br/><br/>In fact, the <i>Quirin </i>Court did not even have 
to address the issue of citizenship at all. At the time, the Nationality
 Act of 1940 stipulated that any citizen serving in a foreign army 
without permission had automatically lost his citizenship. So, according
 to that statute, Haupt, the saboteur who claimed citizenship, was not 
even a citizen. The government was prepared to argue just that point, 
and the Court could easily have ruled on the narrow grounds that Haupt’s
 citizenship claim was void, making him just like the other German 
soldiers, subject to military trial. But the Court went ahead and ruled 
on the issue of citizenship when it did not need to. Why did it do this?<br/><br/>Recall
 that this was 1942, the very darkest hours of World War II, and the 
Court had to know about the mass internment of the Japanese-Americans. 
The Court also had to know that Hawaii was then under martial law, and 
U.S. citizens there were being tried by military tribunal for even petty
 crimes. In addition, FDR had issued a very broad tribunal order (even 
broader than the one Bush has issued) that called for the use of 
military tribunals on any persons who acted on behalf of an enemy 
nation, and this would include citizens and legal resident civilians, 
not just enemy soldiers and foreign spies. Thus, the <i>Quirin</i> Court
 wrote a sweeping decision that left the President as much flexibility 
and freedom to act as he might require in the uncertain years ahead.</div>
<div align="center" class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: center;">
<b>Quirin, The Nearly Forgotten Constitutional Ticking Time Bomb</b></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt;">
Justice Jackson, in his famous dissent in <i>Korematsu</i>, warned that:<br/>[O]nce
 a judicial opinion rationalizes such an order to show that it conforms 
to the Constitution, or rather rationalizes the Constitution to show 
that the Constitution sanctions such an order, the Court for all time 
has validated the principle … [which] then lies about like a loaded 
weapon ready for the hand of any authority that can bring forward a 
plausible claim of an urgent need. Every repetition imbeds that 
principle more deeply in our law and thinking and expands it to new 
purposes. All who observe the work of courts are familiar with what 
Judge Cardozo described as "the tendency of a principle to expand itself
 to the limit of its logic." A military commander may overstep the 
bounds of constitutionality, and it is an incident. But if we review and
 approve, that passing incident becomes the doctrine of the 
Constitution. There it has a generative power of its own, and all that 
it creates will be in its own image. Nothing better illustrates this 
danger than does the Court's opinion in this case.<br/><br/>As it turned out, it was <i>Quirin</i>, not <i>Korematsu</i>,
 which has lain about like a loaded weapon for sixty years before 
finally being picked up by another willful wartime President who is now 
expanding it to new purposes. While the <i>Quirin </i>decision involved 
eight admitted German soldiers in a declared war, the resurrected 
doctrine is now being expanded exponentially in a vague, perpetual “war”
 against terrorism, which is a technique of conflict rather than an 
identifiable enemy, to apply to anyone on the planet the president cares
 to simply accuse of being a “terrorist” or supporting terrorists. The <i>Hamdi</i> Court, by its uncritical acceptance of a flawed decision that should have been as discredited as <i>Korematsu</i>,
 has now multiplied that wartime error by making this modern, wildly 
expanded version the doctrine of the Constitution and thus the supreme 
law of the land.<br/><br/>Most of those who oppose Bush’s particular articulation of this doctrine have not been willing to directly attack <i>Quirin </i>or its affirmation in <i>Hamdi</i>. Indeed, even the opposition briefs submitted to the Supreme Court in the <i>Hamdi</i> and <i>Padilla</i>
 cases merely argued that the President must first get the permission of
 Congress before stripping citizens of their protections under the Bill 
of Rights and that, at most, a detainee was entitled to counsel and some
 measure of a hearing to determine their status as an enemy combatant.<br/><br/>Thus, even the supposed defenders of our rights accepted <i>Quirin</i>
 as good law and hence agree that the Bill of Rights is at the level of a
 mere statute since it can be effectively circumvented by a 
Congressional authorization granting the President the authority to 
treat U.S. citizens like foreign enemies, while making the courts 
complicit in its violation.<br/><br/>Of course, a plurality of the <i>Hamdi</i>
 Court did them one better by finding that Congress had already given 
authorization to detain citizens simply by passing its 2001 
Authorization for Use of Military Force. As asked, the <i>Hamdi</i> 
Court ruled that such detainees could have a lawyer and a “meaningful 
determination” of status, but nothing else in the Bill of Rights. And 
still, the vast majority of the pundits, the professors, and the human 
rights organizations claimed victory. Our freedom will not survive 
another “victory” like this one. The next time the government "captures"
 a U.S. citizen here and designates that citizen an "enemy combatant" 
just as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos%C3%A9_Padilla_%28alleged_terrorist%29">Jose Padilla</a>
 was “captured” at O’Hare International Airport, the Court may find such
 a detention perfectly constitutional, especially now that Congress has 
given its stamp of approval with the Military Commissions Act and its 
extremely broad definition of who may be such an enemy combatant (to 
include citizens, of course). Such a decision may just be the other boot
 that will drop, finally smashing down to drive us into George Orwell’s 
infamous vision of the future as a “boot stamping on a human face --for 
ever."</div>
<div align="center" class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: center;">
<b>Why Have We Abandoned Our Bill of Rights?</b></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt;">
Conservatives,
 sadly, are for the most part silent simply because it is their man in 
the White House. Most lack the vision to look past their time in power 
to the day when a future Democratic president, Hillary Clinton for 
example, <a href="../11/clinton-era-proposal-to-use-military.html">may consider gun owners and tax protesters to be “terrorists</a>.”
 Conservatives are so fixated on prosecuting this “war on terror” that 
they have forgotten Ruby Ridge, Waco, and the finger pointing and 
witch-hunts that followed the Oklahoma City bombing. They have forgotten
 their own distrust of federal power and the reality that political 
winds change. But why are so many liberals, so clearly opposed to Bush’s
 policies at nearly every turn, also willing to accept the circumvention
 of the Bill of Rights through “enemy combatant status” so long as 
detainees get a lawyer and a meager hearing before some elitist judge? 
Why have they ignored the stinging dissent in <i>Hamdi</i> by Justices Scalia and Stevens that confirms our constitutional design, refutes <i>Quirin</i>,
 and levels a devastating criticism of the majority decision as a “Mr. 
Fixit” approach intended to sustain an illegitimate power? Perhaps 
liberals are simply unwilling to acknowledge that the New Deal Court 
left such a vile doctrine laying about to now be used by Bush and his 
neo-con Chicken Hawks. Perhaps many of them, especially the “limousine 
liberals” have an unwarranted faith in judges. Perhaps, but I fear the 
answer is deeper and more dangerous.</div>
<div align="center" class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: center;">
<b>Forsaking the Bill of Rights for Equality’s Sake</b></div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
I
 fear that the answer lies in liberals’ devotion to equality. They want 
so much to treat everyone in the world no differently than they are 
treated that many of them are willing to erode our own protections under
 the Bill of Rights to attain a rough leveling of due process for “all 
citizens of the world.” This is a tragic mistake. The way to lead the 
world to freedom is by first preserving our own freedom here at home 
while working to confine military jurisdiction to only the populations 
of enemy nations in declared wars, and finally, by expanding the 
application of the Bill of Rights to all people, all over the world, 
against whom our government operates –which will of course require an 
end to this insane "war against terror." To do these things, we must 
remain free.<br/><br/>We must not, in the interest of equality for all 
humankind, rip down our Constitution’s wall of separation between 
civilian and military rule and apply to ourselves the same military 
jurisdiction and low level of administrative process our government can 
give foreign enemies under our constitutional design. If we do so, we 
will hand over to the war mongers and empire builders our last weapon of
 liberty, the one shining gift America has given to this world: our Bill
 of Rights. Without it, we will be powerless to stop our own government 
as it - finally free to act without even a pretext to our consent- 
unleashes its raw, unrestrained power on the whole world. Who better to 
put a stop to it than us, and how will we do so if we give up our tools 
of peaceful revolution, our Bill of Rights?<br/><br/>The fate of liberty is in our hands.<span> </span>We
 must either be warriors who stand and fight to bring the world back 
from the brink of a universal tyranny, or, surrendering our Bill of 
Rights, bow down as impotent slaves who can only join the other victims 
at the edge of the ditch. I know not what course others may take, but as
 for me …</div>

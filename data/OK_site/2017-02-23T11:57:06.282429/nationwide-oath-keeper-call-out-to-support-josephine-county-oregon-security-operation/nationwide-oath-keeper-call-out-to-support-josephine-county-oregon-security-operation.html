<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>[Please Note:</strong> There is a lot of misinformation floating around the Internet. The main website of the Oath keepers, and the website of the Josephine County Oath Keepers are the ONLY places to go for Oath Keeper information on this Security Operation. We will keep you posted with the latest information, as soon as we can.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Oath Keepers is NOT standing down. We are committed to helping the owners of the Sugar Pine Mine secure their mine.  – Shorty Dawkins, Associate Editor<strong>]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Josephine County Oregon Oath Keepers Are Calling For Volunteers</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Nationwide Oath Keeper call out to Support Josephine County, Oregon Security Operation</strong><br/>
___________________</p>
<p><strong>NOTE PLEASE: THIS IS NOT A STANDOFF WITH THE BLM</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This support call out is for Oath Keeper members only. Please do not forward it to non members. Joseph Rice of the Josephine County Oath Keepers chapter was asked by miners to provide security as they faced threats from the BLM. He has done an excellent job of organizing security for the miners and their property, as you will see by reading below. This is not a “standoff” with the BLM or any other agency or department. This is a security operation in defense of property rights and unalienable individual rights. It may grow into more, but at present I repeat — This is NOT a standoff.</p>
<p><strong>Boots on the ground are urgently needed now.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is a request for assistance for the Josephine County Oath Keepers who are on site at the Sugar Pine Mine located in Josephine Co. Oregon. They are looking for cool, calm, experienced, and qualified Oath Keepers for positions. Quiet PROFESSIONALS. They will vet everyone who applies and only those qualified, vetted persons will be allowed on site. To volunteer one must contact Joseph Rice. (See contact info below please) Also, please do not go to the mine — you will be turned away. All incoming volunteers must report to the staging area after first having given Joseph Rice notice of your impending arrival.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"> Josephine County Oath Keepers is requesting that you provide assistance, volunteers and supplies. You can go to their web site at this link:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://www.oathkeepersjoco.com/" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.oathkeepersjoco.com/', 'Josephine County Oath Keepers');" target="_blank" title="Josephine County Oath Keepers"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Josephine County Oath Keepers</span></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">…where you can read the necessary skills and resources they need and can respond accordingly. (Or see below)</p>
<p><strong>Please Do Not Try To Apply At Oath Keepers’ National Website.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Make your application at the Josephine County Oath Keepers website only.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Note:<br/>
If you cannot make it in person you can donate at the Josephine Co. website site to help furnish gas, food, etc. Please Do Not make your donations on the national site for this operation. Click this link to donate:</p>

<p>IMPORTANT UPDATE</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[Editor’s Note:  By phone conference Wednesday, April 15, 2015, various Board members and Stewart Rhodes took reports from Joseph Rice who is the coordinator for Josephine County Oath Keepers in Oregon. Joseph Rice has done an outstanding job in furnishing and organizing security to the mines involved in this most-recent gambit by the BLM.  Joseph Rice has a good working relationship with the Sheriff of Josephine County, and he lamented to the Board that the Sheriff is now reporting “death threats” (plural) are being made against the life of the Deputy mentioned in this article.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Oath Keepers Founder and President, Stewart Rhodes, has asked me to make clear to all Oath Keepers everywhere that Oath Keepers will not tolerate any member who makes death threats. Period. According to Josephine County Sheriff, these threats are being investigated now.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I understand the logic in many reactions to this Deputy having made his now infamous statement, (that he “has a problem with the Constitution”) and it is obvious to me that the SPLC’s training programs for “law-enforcement officers” has its fingerprints all over the poor Deputy’s brain. What he has said is a clear example of the sort of training our cops and Deputies are receiving now that America is being converted into a police state. They are being taught that the Constitution and the people who uphold it are “problems” for law enforcement. While that is in itself a travesty and constitutes what amounts to treason, it is not the mission of Oath Keepers to call for the death of any officer who succumbs to the current training programs and devolves his humanity to the point he allows himself to be a tool of governmental tyranny. Brainwashed cops/Deputies/soldiers are not the problem – they are the symptom of the problem.  Our problem is the mechanism which is doing the brainwashing.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Oath Keepers sets a high bar for standards of deportment in order to qualify for membership in our organization. All Oath Keepers are expected to remain calm and cool in their mind sets.</p>
<p>Thank you,</p>
<p>Salute!</p>

<p><strong>SUGAR PINE MINE SECURITY OPERATION</strong></p>
<p>11 April 2015 (Updated April 17 2015)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">At the request of the Sugar Pine Mining Claim owners, the Oath Keepers of Josephine County mission is to ensure the mining claim owners’ 5th Amendment Constitutional Right to Due Process is not violated by the Bureau of Land Management.</p>
<p><strong>NOTICE  </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is <strong>NOT</strong> a standoff with BLM. We are NOT promoting any confrontation with BLM. This is a security operation for the protection of Constitutional Rights. If you have a different agenda outside of the above peaceful mission statement, we don’t need your assistance. Please DO NOT make any type of threatening phone calls to the local BLM or USFS as it undermines our mission, professionalism and is unwarranted. Thank you.</p>

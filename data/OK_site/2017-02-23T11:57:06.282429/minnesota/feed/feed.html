<content:encoded>What can we do Jim to help the people still at the refuge in Oregon and the bundys in prison?  What can we do in Minnesota.  This seems to me to be the biggest abuse yet by the federal government on its citizens in the history of our great nation?  Why are we all mobilizing?  What can we do?  They are holding those arrested in Solitary confinement.  Also the Hammonds are still in prison.  This is nuts!!!

<content:encoded>Interesting … This is referring to Supreme Court Case 14-20333 is it not?
<p>The petition for writ was denied on June 8th, 2015<br/>
The petition for rehearing was also denied on August 10th, 2015<br/>
Not sure if any further action was taken by John Parks Trowbridge, Jr.</p>
<p>Essentially the supreme court felt the petition had no merit.<br/>
<a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/search.aspx?filename=/docketfiles/14-1305.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.supremecourt.gov/search.aspx?filename=/docketfiles/14-1305.htm</a></p>
<p>As far as I can tell all media coverage of this case stopped around June1st, 2015 … presumably because the case was essentially closed per the June 8th denial.</p>
<p>Until the Supreme Court recognizes what John Parks Trowbridge, Jr. is asserting there is no case.  Many of Mr. Trowbridge’s federal tax cases were thrown out and decided against him for various reasons.  I heard about it a number of years ago, for the first time, as he argued that “government” could only tax income once and, therefor, the federal income tax was unconstitutional.  He was wrong and his case was thrown out.  His 2001 case against the IRS was “dismissed with prejudice”, according to the case order, because it was “frivolous”.</p>
<p>I’m not a lawyer either … but I bet there are some subtle, and not so subtle, laws/statues/codes that Mr. Trowbridge is not taking in to consideration.</p>
<p>However, I wonder if he’s managed to stay out jail with all the legal action he brings up?  Interesting.</p>

<content:encoded>Hi Jim,
<p>I recently began receiving email updates from the Oath Keepers.</p>
<p>What the Oath Keepers organization does is crucial to the safety and security of our lives and property. The front lines are a tough place to be and it looks to me like it is being handled well by your group.</p>
<p>I have been following the unlawful actions of the BLM through a number of different sources, primarily Lincoln County Watch.</p>
<p>I must say that the effort to defend the Hammonds, the Bundy’s, the Montana miners is unparalleled in the recent history of our country. For so long the vital task Oath Keepers has undertaken, to insure the right of the people to due process, was left virtually unattended. </p>
<p>During that time the federal services corporations have grown un-constitutionally much bolder. It is for this reason, lack of effective resistance in the United States District Courts, by those targeted for destruction by the BLM, whose tactics are blatantly unlawful, reckless, destructive, that we must identify why we are losing the battle on the ‘legal’ front.</p>
<p>It has become obvious that those who purport to be defending the Hammonds, who are victims of the United States District Courts, the BLM, IRS and every other federal services corporation, presently have both hands and a foot bound. It is very dis-heartening to see people like the Hammonds and Bundy’s have to endure the onslaught of enemies as ruthless as these three letter agencies. </p>
<p>If these thugs are not stopped soon, and by thugs I mean judges and attorneys at the top of the list, paving the way for these TLA’s (three letter agencies) to get by with their crimes against the people, it will begin to happen all across the nation at breakneck speed once the feds come to the arrogant, conclusive realization that we (their intended victims) have embraced the notion that the last line of defense is to take up arms. </p>
<p>I believe in the taking up of arms. I am totally for the planned physical presence of the Oath Keepers for the sake of the Hammonds. But I believe the more permanent way to end their reign of terror is to chain them to the Constitution. </p>
<p>Up till this time the battle has been fought at the United States District Court level. A level where no jurisdiction exists Constitutionally for the actions of these courts. All United States District Courts are Title IV legislative-branch territorial courts of general jurisdiction. </p>
<p>Since these courts are corporate franchises of the UNITED STATES, a chartered powerless federal corporation itself, limited to the geographical area known as NEW COLUMBIA / DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA, they have no jurisdiction under the Constitution in any of the 50 un-incorporated Continental united States. </p>
<p>The reason we are losing at the federal level is that we are so inept at the level of understanding and applying law. We must force the federal services corporations to stay within their boundaries or face charges of treason to the Constitution for the united States of America. The way we do this is to stop playing defense and go on the offense. The way we direct our offense is to force them to prove their jurisdiction, which they have none!</p>
<p>For each un-incorporated ‘state’ of the union, the feds created an equal number of incorporated STATE(s). For example, ‘Minnesota’ signifies the un-incorporated, or public, state. The state belongs to the public. It belongs to those of us born on the land, Joint Tenants in Sovereignty, birthright Continental State Citizens. ‘Becker County’, Minnesota signifies un-incorporated, or public, county and state.</p>
<p>The STATE OF MINNESOTA is the name of the corporate franchise assigned to Minnesota in order for the federal services corporations to subtly usurp control of all operational function of the states, unlawfully of course, but nonetheless not ‘illegal’.  </p>
<p>A once public entity becomes a private entity through incorporation. Incorporating removes the public entity from the jurisdiction of the land, to the jurisdiction of the sea, allowing the federal services corporations, or entities to feign lawful authority over the STATES AND COUNTIES, literally forcing those ‘born and living on the land’  to be treated as ‘inhabitants’ of the land, which we are not. </p>
<p>We are Continental State Citizens, not U.S. CITIZENS, nor UNITED STATES CITIZENS. As Continental State Citizens our only allegiance is to the Constitution for the united States of America. Not to the federal constitution known as the Constitution of the United States, which is nothing more than a federal corporate constitution limited only to the DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA, UNITED STATES CITIZENS, UNITED STATES employees and various federal service corporation enclaves located within the Continental States, provided by the Continental States to the feds, to be able to perform the limited services they were hired by the states for.  </p>
<p>This very well concealed approach by the federal services corporation to perpetually attempt make it appear they have jurisdiction was recently exposed by two very prominent tax cases, one in Lufkin, Texas and the other in Houston, Texas. In both of these cases the defendant is Dr. John Parks Trowbridge. In both cases the United States District Courts have unlawfully ‘taken’ jurisdiction because they lacked jurisdiction by law..</p>
<p>No United States District Court lacking jurisdiction is allowed to ‘take’ jurisdiction without an ‘Act of Congress’. This term ‘Act of Congress’ is used in the U.S.C. in the general sense that it is not likely going to happen. However, in both of the afore-mentioned tax cases the court did take jurisdiction, which they all do all the time, without Congressional approval which constitutes treason to the Constitution. </p>
<p>After scouring the case trying to determine where the error(s) was/were in his pleading it apparently occurred to him it must be some kind of a technical error on his part because he knew the spirit of his defense was bulletproof. Where he discovered the problem was in the wording terms being used. </p>
<p>Since the incorporated STATE OF TEXAS is under the jurisdiction of it’s mother corporation the DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA MUNICIPAL CORPORATION, the appearance was given that indeed the Texas court was in possession of the necessary jurisdiction to prosecute the case. </p>
<p>However, since the mother corporation, the DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA MUNICIPAL CORPORATION is plainly limited by the Constitution for the united States of America to the geographical territory of the DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA ten square mile area and to U.S. CITIZENS, those same limitations apply to all subsidiary corporations as well regardless of where they are located. </p>
<p>Once Mr. Trowbridge grasped the concept of the game the United States District Court was playing regarding jurisdiction, he immediately filed an Objection and Demand in this regard. Following is the exact wording used in the Objection and Demand, and that forced the judges and DOJ attorneys in both Texas cases to fall silent, leaving the cases open. The DOJ attorneys can simply walk away but the oath of  judges requires them to bring to a close every suit adjudicated by them. They must make a ruling, but for over 70+ days they simply fell sub silentio. </p>
<p>Here is the wording of the Objection and Demand by Mr. Trowbridge filed with the court, that caused the court to fall silent. The lynchpin is the fact that no United States District Court has the Constitutional authority to ‘take’ jurisdiction in any of the un-incorporated States/Counties of the Union:</p>
<p>“Defendants Objection to denial of due process of law and Demand for disclosure of the Constitutional authority that gives the court the capacity to take jurisdiction and enter judgments, orders, and decrees in favor of the United States arising from a civil or criminal proceeding regarding a debt, in Tyler County, Texas.</p>
<p>Since the court is completely aware they have no Constitutional authority within any of the 50 Continental un-incorporated states, and since they also know that all subsidiary corporations created by the DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA MUNICIPAL CORPORATION, have the same limited jurisdiction, they had no choice but to fall silent. Had the judge even made one more statement either for or against the defendant Mr. Trowbridge, immediate treason to the Constitution would have been committed. </p>
<p>Charges are now being prepared to be brought against both judges involved in these cases. Both will be indicted for their unlawful actions against Mr. Trowbridge. Jurisdiction, when properly worded (un-incorporated as opposed to incorporated, as in ‘Tyler County, Texas as opposed to the STATE OF TEXAS, is the necessary lynchpin to stop any federal agency from taking further actions against any Continental State Citizen.</p>
<p>Jim, you can read of these cases and obtain copies of the entire lawsuit from the web. Just type in the name John Parks Trowbridge Jr.. </p>
<p>The reason for this long comment is to alert the Oath Keepers to the ONLY remedy available to the Hammonds at this point. If a duplicate Objection and Demand is not filed with the court the Hammonds will most certainly be spending time in prison and will lose everything they have worked so hard for. </p>
<p>So, the physical call to action in support of the Hammonds, and the Bundy’s, and the Montana miners is probably necessary given the stage of the developments against the Hammonds by the feds. However, achieving the stoppage of the court action and the certain subsequent charges to be filed against the judge and the BLM paving the way for restitution to the Hammonds for all harm committed against them by both a rogue United States District Court and the rogue BLM will set a very desirable precedent.</p>
<p>I am not a lawyer. I have been through ten tough years of battle with the IRS doing most of the legal research and response myself. There is light at the end of the tunnel. The IRS has fallen silent in my case also. This will also soon be resolved as they will be forced to return my property to my wife and I.</p>
<p>Someone with quick access to the Hammonds must get this information to them as soon as possible. It is their only permanent remedy! Please see that somehow this information is reviewed by those who have been attempting to fight the legal wolves for the Hammonds. </p>
<p>To save time, rather than you or someone else having to research where to find this info, I would be happy to get a copy of the Objection and Demand into whoever hands is necessary<br/>
via fax or email.</p>
<p>Time is running out on the Hammonds.</p>
<p>The other thing is, all the damage the BLM has caused will be back on their own heads and many of their officers will likely be spending a very long time in prison.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Ever wonder why ISIL has never attacked Israel? They are extreme fundamental Moslems, ( or so they claim), so shouldn’t they be opposed to Israel? like their Saudi backers? Why would an Israeli Colonel help ISIL?  –  Shorty Dawkins, Associate Editor</p>

<p>by F. William Engdahl</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This was definitely not supposed to happen. It seems that an Israeli military man with the rank of colonel was “caught with IS pants down.” By that I mean he was captured amid a gaggle of so-called IS–or Islamic State or ISIS or DAESH depending on your preference–terrorists, by soldiers of the Iraqi army. Under interrogation by the Iraqi intelligence he apparently said a lot regarding the role of Netanyahu’s IDF in supporting IS.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In late October an Iranian news agency, quoting a senior Iraqi intelligence officer, reported the capture of an Israeli army colonel, named Yusi Oulen Shahak, reportedly related to the ISIS Golani Battalion operating in Iraq in the Salahuddin front. In a statement to Iran’s semi-official Fars News Agency a Commander of the Iraqi Army stated, “The security and popular forces have held captive an Israeli colonel.” He added that the IDF colonel “had participated in the Takfiri ISIL group’s terrorist operations.” He said the colonel was arrested together with a number of ISIL or IS terrorists, giving the details: “The Israeli colonel’s name is Yusi Oulen Shahak and is ranked colonel in Golani Brigade… with the security and military code of <a href="http://en.farsnews.com/newstext.aspx?nn=13940730000210" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://en.farsnews.com/newstext.aspx?nn=13940730000210', 'Re34356578765az231434');" target="_blank"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Re34356578765az231434</span></a>.”</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Why Israel?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Ever since the beginning of Russia’s very effective IS bombing of select targets in Syria on September 30, details of the very dirty role of not only Washington, but also NATO member Turkey under President Erdogan, Qatar and other states has come into the sunlight for the first time.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">It’s becoming increasingly clear that at least a faction in the Obama Administration has played a very dirty behind-the-scenes role in supporting IS in order to advance the removal of Syrian President Bashar al Assad and pave the way for what inevitably would be a Libya-style chaos and destruction which would make the present Syrian refugee crisis in Europe a mere warmup by comparison.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">The “pro-IS faction” in Washington includes the so-called neo-conservatives centered around disgraced former CIA head and executioner of the Iraqi “surge” General David Petraeus. It also includes US General John R. Allen, who since September 2014 had served as President Obama’s Special Presidential Envoy for the Global Coalition to Counter ISIL (Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant) and, until she resigned in February 2013, it included Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Significantly, General John Allen, an unceasing advocate of a US-led “No Fly Zone” inside Syria along the border to Turkey, something President Obama refused, was relieved of his post on 23 October, 2015. That was shortly after launch of the highly-effective Russian strikes on Syrian IS and Al Qaeda’s Al Nusra Front terrorist sites changed the entire situation in the geopolitical picture of Syria and the entire Middle East.</span></p>

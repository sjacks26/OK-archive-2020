<p style="text-align: justify;">Testimonial – We all have moments during our lifetime where we experience a feeling of clarity, as if we are exactly where we are meant and born to be. For me, one of those moments came as I stood on the ramp of a C-130 as a hydraulics mechanic, at 0300 on a clear, starry night. I had been raised as a three percenter, even if I didn’t know there was a name for it. My siblings and I, born and bred in the Wisconsin northwoods, were taught that our freedoms were sacred, and that to defend them was not only our greatest honor as Americans, but our most important duty. I enlisted with this core belief, and the time I spent in the Air Force was incredibly important to me.</p>
<p>I have had other moments like that; moments where I was so certain of the rightness of my actions that to be asked to die defending them would have been something I was not only willing but proud to do. Standing shoulder to shoulder with other patriots in the cause of liberty, I have felt over and over that same strength of purpose. The oath I took as an airman is not something that I have forgotten, nor is it something that I have forsaken. It is part of my core, part of the person that I was then, and who I am now. My oath stands as it did then, backed by the promise of my life. I WILL stand. I will defend the Constitution against all enemies foreign and domestic, and even though I have traded my uniform for the clothes of a civilian, my beliefs have not changed and my resolve has not wavered. I am an Oath Keeper, a three percenter, and an American patriot, now and as long as I live.</p>

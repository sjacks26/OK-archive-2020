<content:encoded>January 5, 2016  The Rule Of Law No Longer Exists In Western Civilization
<p>My work documenting how the law was lost began about a quarter of a century ago. A close friend and distinguished attorney, Dean Booth, first brought to my attention the erosion of the legal principles on which rests the rule of law in the United States. My columns on the subject got the attention of an educational institution that invited me to give a lecture on the subject. Subsequently, I was invited to give a lecture on “How The Law Was Lost” at the Benjamin Cardozo School of Law in New York City.</p>

<content:encoded>Thank you for using the quote from the Holy Bible: “We can do all things through Him who strengthens us.” His word is eternally true. Every day we say “So help me God.” because He alone overpowers all evil to have His will done. Yes, rebellious sinners will go from bad to worse, but He [God] has said “He shall build His church and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.” “What can [evil] men do to separate us from the love of God?”  Nothing.

<content:encoded>Awesome song. Where can I get a copy?  I  and had to listen this several times and it brought back memories of my cousin who died from effects of PTSD. and the VA’s indifference and incompetence. He served two tours in Viet Nam as a US Army  infantryman.  Your song brought back many memories, both good and bad. For that I thank you, thank you, thank you!!! I GOD bless you, brother.<br/>

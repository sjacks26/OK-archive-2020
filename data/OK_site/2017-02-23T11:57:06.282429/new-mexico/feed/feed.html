<content:encoded>Patriots, at 6pm. on Mar. 10th. of this yr. in Animas, New Mexico, will be a “gathering of eagles” event that focuses on a major problem and  there are fellow citizen-patriots that need our help.  Ranchers and farmers in the Hidalgo Co. and Cochise Co. of NM and Az. respectively, are under siege from the Mex. Cartels that are bringing over their drugs and aliens.  With the new BP policy handed down from this admin., of catch and release (after the BP takes their food/drugs and turns them around to go back to Mex. which many don’t)many ranches, homes and communities have seen an uptick in an already chronic problem, of break ins by illegals, looking for food, water, etc.  Law enforcement is being overwhelmed and the locals are not only in danger but cannot sustain over a period of time, these kinds of conditions.  We have been in contact with the organizer of the event and she would like to have our representation at this event to introduce ourselves and our purpose.  There are many OK’s planning on attending this event and would like to meet n’ greet our NM counterparts.  If any of you can make it to this important gathering, please do so.  You can find info online at New Mexico Cattlemen Growers Association or email me at <a href="mailto:rockdog48@hotmail.com">rockdog48@hotmail.com</a>

<content:encoded>Hi Carlie. The best way to help and get those vets involved is to go to the Oath Keepers store at <a href="http://www.oathkeepersgear.net/" rel="nofollow">http://www.oathkeepersgear.net/</a> and order either the Oath Keepers brochures or push cards there to hand them out to those vets and explain the mission of the Oath Keepers. You help support the Oath Keepers this way and help bring in new people and get them involved as well.

<content:encoded>God Bless the NM community! Native American veterens if you’re out there, God Bless you, you are loved! I don’t want to offend anyone who has a different faith, just understand that the fundimentals, of humanity is that by choice we are who we are and what faith we choose, we are free, but it takes extra dedication of principles that we re-establish communities of fundimental mutual respect of in-aleenable rights. Those who wish to trample those rights are not welcome, certain cultures of subjigation and abuse supposedly in the name of goodness and faith, those cultures are not welcome here even if their foreign lands are war torn. Those foreign lands are torn apart because of a disgraceful and evil culture has taken over and is trying to spread to N. America as well, and it is being spread here by government leaders on every level from federal level on down to the city and county level, and even the churches wanting to naively welcom everyone whether they are evil or not! All cultures know what evil is even if its in different forms or has different names.

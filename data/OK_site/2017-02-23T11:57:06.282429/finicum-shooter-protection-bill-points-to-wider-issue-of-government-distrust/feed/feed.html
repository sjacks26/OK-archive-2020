<content:encoded>Probably would be worth the effort to lobby for laws to prohibit the use of contractors for LE activities. Uniform accountability &amp; training. Plus, assures local employment.

<content:encoded>things are getting interesting here in ORYGUN ! some groups here in the state are now trying to go after sheriff GLEN PALMER.<br/>
they are so excited about it … these ill informed bolshevik pocket gophers think they can revoke palmers police license or something, they apparently don’t realize the co sheriff is an elected official who is sworn to uphold the constitution for the people of his county. sheriff is not a policeman though he acts as one, it goes much further than that as he has law enforcement authority over the entire county for one thing, and since he has a sworn oath to go by the constitution that is what he must do. a recall election or loss of a subsequent election is the only way i can imagine this would happen. it will be interesting to see how this will all shake out… palmer is a huge figure in the CSPOA, google it if you are not familiar. the uninformed bolshevik dolts are saying, WHO THE HELL DO THESE SHERIFFS THINK THEY ARE ? the ignorance is just stunning ! among their ranks it has become fashionable to demonize anyone who even mentions the constitution, OH YOUR ONE THOSE POCKET CONSTITUTION RED NECKS…. this is an enigma to say the least ! they must have in their pocket the bolshevik manifesto, this the only reasonable explanation i can muster. when ben carson was aked if he thought a sharia muslim could follow the constitution he said yes, but they would have to be schizophrenic…. good answer, same with these bolshevik radical progressives who moralize to us rednecks about the environment &amp; the global warming hoax. i believe this is all connected to the same agenda we are dealing with here, in my mind EPA, BLM, NOAA, and others,are parasite regulatory agencies like fat ticks on a hound that need to be removed. final word… i hope the exposure of all the corruption state &amp; federal will awaken the sleeping masses.

<p>here is a little background on the fbi agent in charge, oh yes ! i can hear you gasping in shock, the fbi ? really ?  YES.<br/>
i just have to wonder how involved james comey was in all of this, do you think he was even aware of what his agency was getting into out here, or was he being ill advised by a slick agent who thought he would look really good with a nice feather in his fbi hat ? when corruption rules the day what is there left for folks to do ?<br/>

attacks against the constitution are like the self infilicted wounds of a mad man</p>

<content:encoded>All records buried and / or sealed is the legacy of the Sandy Hook Elementary School security theater episode. This will be made to disappear entirely, and we can expect a lot more of this kind of thing until we figure out how to punish such behavior.
<p>The ‘threats’ are likely not even real, just a made-up excuse. Fedgov is not going to tolerate challenges to it’s claimed ‘authority’, so long as it can bring overwhelming force to bear. Look how it ran from the Bundy Ranch and decided to grab him when he went to Portland, and had no support system. It’s just a pay-back for embarrassing the BLM. But, there records of who was assigned to that roadblock, and those will show who the assigned shooters were. They may be gotten via FOIA requests, or perhaps a patriotic ‘leak’ – or hack. But the work detail records do exist. The point of it is that hiding the records behind a ‘wall of law’ means they can escape any kind of culpability for what clearly seems to be a murder on video, and so also escape any need to answer uncomfortable questions about why the state was killing someone for a federal agency, and not even the main leaders of the ‘opposition’ at that.</p>

<content:encoded>This bill passed in the Oregon House yesterday with overwhelming bipartisan support and a vote of 55 to 3! It’s expected to do the same in the Senate soon.

<content:encoded>Oregon has always had too many weirdoes.  Now they’re staffing some sheriff departments. That’s just an open invitation for the feds to come in and do as they wish. I’ve watched the Finicum killing several times; looks like an ambush to me.

<content:encoded>There was a previous email I received about training in San Antonio. There was a radio recommendation for a BaoFeng but I don’t recall which unit was recommended.<br/>
If anyone can let me know, I would appreciate it.<br/>
Thanks, Jeff

<content:encoded>When the crap hits the fan….a ham license will not be necessary, however….for now it’s a start for those that want to learn communications while playing an active role in any operation(s). The experienced users are very necessary, but that call sign might get you a greeting when you get home, depending on the outcome of any operation. If Bunkerville had gone very bad, those call signs would have been collected, and probably were anyway, but then again, license plates are also vulnerable.
<p>However….FRS radios (used to compliment Ham comms) were used in Quartzsite Arizona during an Oath Keepers 2nd amendment march to oust a corrupt police chief, requires no license, and when security is extremely important, the range of FRS is sufficient in most cases and NOT subject to an operator losing a license for which is not required. Therefore….code away ! </p>
<p>The downfall for Ham radio comms is the simple fact, the government does not allow non-standard (created) codes which is essential for these type of operations, but when SHTF, it will not matter. WE tried using Ham communications for a while on the border during Minuteman operations and interference from other Ham operators across the region (when using a repeater) caused us to use FRS (UHF) comms only. We did that for at least 5 years. </p>
<p>The base stations were ICOM with pre-programmed FRS frequencies, and a repeater was established deep in the desert for long distance comms. Many in the field used conventional handheld radios purchased on the open market. SAR Teams used the same radios, but on encrypted frequencies. We often had up to 30 miles range with the more expensive handheld radios and about 10 miles with the cheap radios. </p>
<p>In any event…it sounds like the operation was very successful (and this article needed a comment to get the ball rolling)</p>

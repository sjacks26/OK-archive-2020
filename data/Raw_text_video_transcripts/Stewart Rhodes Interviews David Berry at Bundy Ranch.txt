## Stewart Rhodes; David Berry; Richard Mack; Unknown Black Man

SR: So Dave was at our first conference. Dave Berry, right? He’s a Navy veteran. Tell the story about that. Why’d you go to our conference in 2009.

DB: At the tender age of 17, after 3 years in JROTC, I decided to serve my country in the United States Navy as a Seabee.

SR: Cool. Can do, right?

DB: Can do. Made it up here too. Yeah, nah, I just took my oath serious. I know it requires a lot of dedication and study. You have to know what you’re talking about. You don’t want to be out there fired up for no reason. Just seeing what was going on out here, from Vegas, watching the news.
 SR: You’re from Vegas, right? 

DB: Yes

SR: In 2009, you read about us. You heard about us. What made you come down to our conference that year?

DB: I looked at an article that was linked to, I think it was InfoWars. It was the SPLC had done a piece about Stewart Rhodes. I saw an interview from you, Alex Jones did an interview with you. Then I saw that article. They said that OK were white supremacists, homophobes, xenophobes, what else. Just bigots. Anybody who was black or whatever they consider themselves, they would have saw that, read that article, would not have shown up. But for me, it’s no fear. The only thing I fear is god and the judgment of god.

SR: (In the background) You should go sit next to him. The black Oath Keeper can tell you

DB: So I went, found that it was prior military, retired police chiefs, sheriffs. People who believe in the Constitution. I believe in the Constitution too, because man can’t do anything right, so we need something to ground us, and it was those founding documents. I totally understand why they’re there, and I know why I’m here, and I know what I’m willing to do. I’m willing to die for god and country, absolutely.

SR: He didn’t even know it, but we put his interview on our website. You go to our about page, his interview is still sitting there. It’s good to see you again. So what do you think about this?

DB: Oh, fully inspired. I just want to know what the next step is. How do we take this and make it bigger? Another thing that I really. Cause we can talk about laws, we can talk about things going on in the world, and it’s a matter of opinion. But there are things going on in our skies, you know, chemtrailing. People need to really do their own research about it. There’s, What in the World are they Spraying, a documentary. I’m currently
 SR: Yeah. Edward Griffin did that.

DB: Yes. I’m currently having some copies produced, and I’m going to start putting them out there. The chemtrails, it’s a huge thing. People need to start looking at that. That’s one thing to shake them out of that trance they’re in. A lot of people are in a state of disbelief. Once they can see something and really start asking questions, then you start asking more and more questions.

SR: (0:03:11.7) Then you get a flood of awareness, it’s like oh man. A lot of bad stuff going on. NSA spying on us, drones being authorized to be in American skies, they claim the President can kill anyone he wants to.

DB: NDAA

SR: Well even before that

DB: December 31, 2012. He signed it in, right before New Years. Everyone’s partying, bringing in the new year. And this devil is signing his signature on something that puts all of our lives at risk. It doesn’t matter what your skin color is. That’s the one thing that Eric Holder was talking about recently, with Al Sharpton. He said that no attorney general has ever been treated like this. No president has ever been treated like this. It’s like, no no no.

SR: That stuff started before. Bush started it. He’s the first one that detained Jose Padilla and Yaser Hamdi. It started under a white Republican. This is what a lot of Republicans didn’t understand, that there are traitors inside their party just as bad as the Democrats. This is just a continuation. All Obama did is say okay, I’ll do you one better. I’ll start killing these MFers. That’s where we are now. That’s why I started Oath Keepers. That was the big thing that got me started, Bush’s detention of Jose Padilla and Yaser Hamdi, then the Supreme Court rubber stamped that in the Hamdi case, said yeah it’s okay. Now you see Congress coming in with the NDAA, all they’re really doing is saying yes we agree with that interpretations of the AUMF from back in 2001. They’re saying yeah. Everything Bush did after that in the name of the War on Terrorism, everything he’s done interpreting his power, we’re saying yes to. And he’s [garbled] Democrat.

DB: It all started from Abraham Lincoln declaring martial law and attacking Americans.

SR: That’s right. He’s the first one who did that.

DB: (0:05:07.9) They never lifted it because he was assassinated.

SR: Actually, the Supreme Court in the Milligan case in 1866 ruled that unconstitutional. They did do that, so they put the genie back in the bottle. But then FDR popped the bottle back open during WW2. They had a German saboteur who claimed he was a US citizen. They had a statute back then that said if you join a foreign enemy force, you’ve renounced your citizenship. So they could have just said hey you’re not a citizen anymore. But they didn’t. So the court said citizenship’s irrelevant. You know why they did that? Because he had an executive order that said we will apply military jurisdiction and the laws of war to any American that he determines is aiding the enemy. You can go back, this is in the paper I wrote at Yale Law School. You go read Lincoln’s declaration, his executive order, you line that up next to FDR’s, they’re almost identical. Then you go get Bush’s order in 2001 and line it up, and it’s almost identical to all three. They’re almost identical, the same exact thing of power.

DB: (0:06:10.0) Because it’s the declaration of a state of emergency that they keep up every year to keep up the military dictatorship.

SR: Actually, it’s. What they did is they said I can apply the laws of war domestically the same as if you’re overseas. You should read my paper. You see it lined out right there, they’re almost identical. It is scary how much FDR looks like just Lincoln, and how much Bush sounded like FDR. It’s all the same.

DB: They’re all Federalists. They all bow down to the bank of London.

SR: Well, everyone’s starting to realize now with the economic situation. This is why, OK, the latest thing we’re doing, the CPT program, because we understand they will use an economic collapse as their rationale. It’s like 9/11 even bigger. Their rationale to strip away the rest of the Constitution and put us under their subjection. The world banking system and the world government system. That’s what’s coming.

DB: (0:07:05.9) I also think they’re trying to take the dollars out of circulation.

SR: Oh yeah

DB: So they can bring in another currency. The Federal Reserve, the private Federal Reserve, is trying to bring in another currency.

SR: What they’ll do is kill the dollar and they’ll say the problem was the Federal Reserve wasn’t big enough. We need a bigger Federal Reserve, a worldwide Fed. That’s their answer.

DB: I’m not going to bow down to a Rothschild ever. A Rothschild, a Rockefeller, a Warburg, an Oppenheimer, none of them. I’m not ever going to bow down, and you’re going to have to deal with that.

SR: That’s right. And the rest of us. That’s what’s cool about this. This is Americans of all kinds coming together and taking a stand. The Westerner is starting to understand that their land is being taken from them for a reason, they don’t want you to be independent, they don’t want you to be able to grow your own food, they don’t want the states independent. But it’s way beyond that. Every American, whether they live in a city or in the country, it doesn’t matter where you live, they want you dependent, they want you broke, they want you desperate. So we need to make sure to take care of each other, form neighborhood watches, put in place good sheriffs, we need to be able to step up as a sheriff’s posse behind the sheriff. All the veterans especially need to come together, lead their communities, and get organized. 

DB: (0:08:23.1) Does the Sheriff know what Posse Comitatus is?

SR: This one here? Probably not. He probably does know what public pressure is. You saw, under public pressure he finally showed up today. Probably has political ambition. He was able to, you know. You know what, Sheriff Mack, come here. This is Dave Berry, the young Navy veteran from our first conference.

DB: Good to see you again.

RM: Way to go.

SR: Remember him?

RM: Absolutely.

SR: He was at our first conference.

RM: 5 years ago. 

SR: Yeah, a long time ago.

DB: I’m still around.

RM: What was the name of that hotel we had it in.

SR: The Texas. I was just telling him his video is still on the About page for OK. Sheriff Mack’s on my board of directors, and CSPOA. You should join, get involved in OK.

DB: Yeah

SR: Join the chapter here, we have a good chapter here.

DB: (0:09:22.0) I have to.

SR: Good to see you.

DB: I’ve been busy with work and crap.

SR: That’s no excuse.

DB: No it’s not.

SR: You don’t get off the hook.

DB: I’m actually thinking about quitting work.

SR: This gentleman here is one of our chapter members.

DB: How you doin sir. I’m David.

UBM: I’m a white supremacist.

SR: He’s in disguise. No, this guy lives in Vegas. He’s going to join the Vegas chapter and get busy. Good to see you again. Let me give you my email, and let me get yours too. You gotta join the Vegas chapter and help out.

DB: Okay. And I’ve gotta read your paper.

SR: Yeah. Do. That’s what scared the shit out of me. I was a student at Yale Law School when 9/11 hit, then I started watching what they were doing. I’m a student of history, I was like I’ve seen this before. This is what they did in Nazi Germany. They used war and emergency as an excuse to set aside criminal law. That’s what they did. I researched it back. That’s the other thing, the Nazis did almost the same exact thing. They had normal courts for normal criminals. Then they had People’s courts, which was a second legal track for political opponents of the regime. That was stacked with Nazi judges who were compliant. You didn’t get any due, it was a kangaroo court, a show trial. A Stalinist show trial basically, same kind of stuff. So what they’re doing here is the same thing, setting up a separate track. So if you’re a domestic terrorist or enemy, they will say you don’t get a jury trial. Instead, you’re going to get a trial in a military tribunal. That’s what they did. I looked at that and said holy shit, we’re in trouble. Now we’ve crossed the Rubicon already. You no longer. In fact now all 3 branches, you have the Executive branch doing it, you’ve got the courts saying yeah that’s okay, now you have Congress. That’s all 3. That’s why the NDAA is so dangerous. It gives full. Now a commander can pull out the law and say hey guys, it’s legal, see? Congress passed a law saying we can do this and it does apply to American citizens.

DB: (0:11:25.0) It’s all crap. It comes from the Magna Carta, it’s that stamp staple system, where it’s all voluntary, it’s all contract. Like all law is contract.

SR: I don’t know about that. What I do know is that when the Founders rebelled against the King, one of the things they rebelled against was denial of jury. They did the same crap. Parliament passed a law saying normal trials for normal offenses, but if you do these things, like smuggle or anything else, we’re going to apply admiralty law instead. That’s what they said, that’s what they did. We’re seeing the same thing. Every regime does it. Hitler did it, Stalin did it, King George did it. Every oppressive regime you can think of throughout world history has done this.

DB: Admiralty law is contract law. It’s based on contract. You have to have a contract from one man to another man, both signatures, on a contract.

SR: That’s the mechanism they picked. Our government, to attain the same end, has said well, we’re going to apply the laws of war. Yes you have the right to a jury trial, unless you’re the enemy in wartime. That’s what they say. What they’re of course ignoring is the treason clause. Article 3 Section 3. You know what it says, right?

DB: No

SR: (0:12:33.3) You don’t know it? Okay. Article 3 says all trials, for every crime except impeachment shall be by jury, right? That’s one thing it says. Article 3 Section 3 defines the crime of treason as making war against the United States or aiding enemies. That’s the crime of treason. If you’re accused of treason, what do they have to do to you?

DB: Evidence.

SR: First they have to give you a jury trial. Then it requires 2 witnesses to the same overt act of treason or confession in open court. So yeah evidence. But nowhere else in law do you see that burden, extra burden of 2 witnesses to the same overt act or open confession in court. You know what that was meant to stop, the confession in open court? Torture. If you have to confess in open court, that means they can’t torture you behind the scenes, coerce you into confession by burning your feet or whatever, hanging you from a tree and beating you. They have to have you in court when you give the confession. That’s what it’s meant to prevent.

SR: (0:13:35.7) So the Founders had just gone through that. They’d seen the Starr Chamber in English history. They had just been accused of being traitors themselves. So they made sure, they said look, it can’t be your speech. That’s one thing, they were accused of treason just for their speech. It has to be an overt act of aiding the enemy and it requires 2 witnesses or a confession in open court. It requires a jury trial. So the Constitution tells you right there what has to be done with an American accused of making war against his own country. He must get a trial for treason.

DB: What happened in Prescott Bush. When he got busted for aiding Nazi Germany.

SR: Nothing! What do you mean what happened to him. Nothing happened to him.

DB: Didn’t apply to him, okay.

SR: But here we are today. Fast forward to today. Like I told the guys in the crowd. You’ve got Republicans, you’ve got guys like Allen West, who should know better. They don’t get a pass, he signed the NDAA. He was one of the guys who said yes to it.

DB: Did he really?

SR: Oh yeah, he voted for it when he was in Congress. You’ve got Lindsey Graham, you’ve got John McCain. They love this crap. They love applying the laws of war to Americans. You got a very dangerous infection inside the Republican Party of traitors. Even they’re. You’ve got some. I’d say John McCain, Lindsey Graham are knowing traitors, they know exactly what they are doing. Then the rest of them, because they’re so afraid of al-Qaeda, so afraid of terrorists, that they’re willing to sign away the Constitution.

DB: That’s the CIA.

SR: Well sure, behind that is the NSA. It’s a whole shadow government we saw all the way through, starting in the Reagan administration, up through there. What do you think FEMA is? That’s the same crap. That’s where we are. The more people understand that, that it’s not this party or that party, it’s not just Obama, it’s also. It’d be wonderful if it was all the Democrats are bad, all the Republicans are good. It’d be a lot easier. It’s way worse than that. There are. Either you’re a constitutionalist and you believe in individual liberty or you’re a totalitarian oath breaker, and they’re in both parties. That’s where we are. You know that.

DB: Yes.

SR: That’s where we are. The only way we can change this is to make every American understand, and I should have said this on the stage, that your first duty, your absolute ground zero duty is to purge your own political party of every oath breaker. If they’re in your party, whatever party you’re in, you need to purge them out. Take care, sweep your own backyard clean. Take care of your own front porch, and everybody does the same thing. I don’t care what party they’re in, if they’re breaking the Constitution, they’re out. Scorched earth policy against all oath breakers, that’s what we have to do. If you vote for the lesser of two evils, what do you end up with?

DB: Evil.

SR: Yeah. It’s like drinking poison, and going oh I’ll take a reduced dose of poison, I won’t take the full dose. You’re still going to die. Good to see you again.

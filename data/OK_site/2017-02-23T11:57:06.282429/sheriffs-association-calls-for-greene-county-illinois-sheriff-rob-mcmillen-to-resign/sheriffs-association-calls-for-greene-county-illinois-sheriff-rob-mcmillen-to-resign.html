<p>By: Tim Starks</p>
<p>The Constitutional Sheriffs and Peace Officers Association (CSPOA)  has called for the resignation of Greene County, Illinois Sheriff Rob  McMillen after he personally initiated an unsubstantiated felony charge  against Luke Lamb, who is his opponent in the upcoming election. Lamb is  campaigning as a “constitutional sheriff’s candidate” and is a member  of CSPOA. The case, which involved alleged jury tampering, was resolved  in court on October 24<sup>th</sup>, with a unanimous jury verdict of acquittal.</p>
<p>The charge of jury tampering involved Lamb’s Facebook chat with a  close friend who had been called to jury duty earlier that morning. This  discussion took place before the juror was assigned to a particular  case, so he knew nothing about the specific type of trial that would  take place later in the day. Lamb referred his friend to the website of  the Fully Informed Jury Association (fija.org), which educates citizens  about the recognized right of a juror to judge both the law and the  facts of the case. According to recognized legal authorities, including  US Supreme Court justices, the juror has the power to acquit if he or  she believes that the law under which the defendant is charged is itself  unjust. And any citizen has a First Amendment right to express his  views about this topic, which is often called “jury nullification”.</p>
<p>Sheriff McMillen apparently was contacted by one of his deputies and  informed of the Facebook conversation, whereupon McMillen personally  obtained copies of that conversation from a friend who was a chief of  police. McMillen then, without any investigation at all, and without  assigning someone else to investigate, personally wrote a departmental  report and sent the information to the state’s attorney’s office, under  his signature. The state’s attorney then assigned it to a special  prosecutor. To date, CSPOA is unable to find any report on an  investigation by the special prosecutor.</p>
<p>Eventually the charge, a class 4 felony under Illinois law, was  filed. According to Lamb, after the depositions and case preparation for  trial, the prosecution offered several plea deals, the last of which  amounted to something akin to texting while driving, a misdemeanor of  negligible import. Lamb refused them all and took his case to trial.</p>
<p>According to Sheriff Richard Mack (Ret.), Founder and President of  CSPOA, “This case has all the markings of a political hit. If it wasn’t  so serious it would be hilarious.” Said Mack, “Sheriff McMillen, to  avoid the appearance of a conflict of interest, could have, and should  have recused himself, referring the information to an outside agency  from the very start, if he thought there was any basis for charges.  Looking at the Facebook posts, I don’t think any investigator who didn’t  have a political motive, would have brought charges against Luke Lamb.”</p>
<p>After reviewing the facts, documents and published reports in this  case, including Sheriff McMillen’s testimony and media interviews after  the verdict, it’s clear that this is an example of Unconstitutional  misconduct by an official who has sworn an oath to protect citizen’s  rights, according to Sheriff Mack. “Sheriff McMillen has violated his  oath, his constituent’s rights, and tarnished the badge of a peace  officer. We therefore call for Sheriff McMillen to resign his position  immediately. Further, if he does not, we urge the voters of Greene  County to remove him from office at the ballot box in the upcoming  election.”</p>

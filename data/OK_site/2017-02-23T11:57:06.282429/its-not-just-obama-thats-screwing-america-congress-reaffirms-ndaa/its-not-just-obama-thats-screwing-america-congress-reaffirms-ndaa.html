<p><em>This article was written by M.D. Creekmore and originally published at <a href="http://www.thesurvivalistblog.net/obama-screwing-america-congress-reaffirms-indefinite-detention-americans-ndaa/" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.thesurvivalistblog.net/obama-screwing-america-congress-reaffirms-indefinite-detention-americans-ndaa/', 'TheSurvivalistBlog.net');">TheSurvivalistBlog.net</a></em></p>
<p>That’s right folks, it isn’t just our fearless leader B.O. that’s   wiping his butt on the Constitution and the Bill of rights, it’s   congress too, and before you go off blaming the democrats, no matter how   evil they are, I should point out that this monstrosity against   American citizens, was reaffirmed with the support of a majority of   republicans – see the full congressional member roll-call and <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/113-2014/h234" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/113-2014/h234', 'how they voted here');" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">how they voted here</a>.</p>
<p>The “No” votes are votes against amendment  H.Amdt. 676 sponsored Rep Adam Smith (D) <span style="text-decoration: underline;">to eliminate indefinite detention of American citizens</span>, without due process of law under the NDAA H.R. 4435.</p>
<p>In total <strong>214 republicans</strong> voted <span style="text-decoration: underline;">against</span> amendment  H.Amdt. 676  that would have eliminated the power given to   the president and the executive branch allowing for the indefinite   detention of American citizens under NDAA without formal charges, or due   process of law.</p>
<p>Looking to my state of  TN Republican “representatives” Phil Roe R,   Chuck Fleischmann, Scott DesJarlais, Diane Black, Marsha Blackburn, and   Stephen Fincher all voted <strong>against</strong> the amendment that would have eliminated the power of indefinite detention of Americans given to the president under NDAA.</p>
<p>They are an embarrassment to the state of TN and to America as a whole.</p>
<p>What exactly is the <a href="http://rt.com/usa/160832-ndaa-gitmo-detention-approved/" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://rt.com/usa/160832-ndaa-gitmo-detention-approved/', 'National Defense Authorization Act ');" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">National Defense Authorization Act </a>you   ask? Well it essentially does away with the constitutionally  guaranteed  right to a due process and a fair trial by providing the  executive  branch of government with the power to arrest and detain  indefinitely  any US citizen, without charge or due process of law.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.thenewamerican.com/usnews/constitution/item/18328-house-passes-ndaa-critical-amendments-fail-others-succeed" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.thenewamerican.com/usnews/constitution/item/18328-house-passes-ndaa-critical-amendments-fail-others-succeed', 'Via The New Ameriican');" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Via The New Ameriican</a></p>
<blockquote><p>One of the most noxious elements of the NDAA is that it  places the  American military at the disposal of the president for the   apprehension, arrest, and detention of those suspected of posing a   danger to the homeland.</p>
<p>Furthermore, a key component of the NDAA mandates a frightening grant   of immense and unconstitutional power to the executive branch. Under   the provisions of Section 1021 the president is afforded the absolute   power to arrest and detain citizens of the United States without their   being informed of any criminal charges, without a trial on the merits of   those charges, and without a scintilla of the due process safeguards   protected by the Constitution of the United States.</p>
<p>Further, in order to execute the provisions of Section 1021, Section   1022 (among others) unlawfully gives the president the absolute and   unquestionable authority to deploy the armed forces of the United States   to apprehend and to indefinitely detain those suspected of threatening   the security of the “homeland.” In the language of this legislation,   these people are called “covered persons.”</p>
<p>The universe of potential “covered persons” includes every citizen of   the United States of America. Any American could one day find himself   or herself branded a “belligerent” and thus subject to the complete   confiscation of his or her constitutional civil liberties and nearly   never-ending  incarceration in a military prison.</p></blockquote>
<p>What this amounts to is essentially a repeal of the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/sixth_amendment" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/sixth_amendment', 'sixth amendment ');" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">sixth amendment </a> and  once again our so-called “conservatives republicans” have showed  where  they stand, how they stand and what they stand for. Why we keep  voting  either one of these political parties (republican – democrat /  democrat –  republican) and their attached evils into office to “lead”  OUR country,  is beyond me.</p>
<p>Folks we don’t have a two-party system as we’ve been lead to   believe. Many Americans think that they have a choice when they enter   the voting booth. Well guess what we don’t – republicans and democrats,   democrats and republicans what’s the difference? Neither political  party  actually represents the American people nor do they care about   defending individual American rights or the Constitution</p>
<p>In the U.S. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVodI85NLMQ" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVodI85NLMQ', 'we have a one party system masquerading as a two party system');" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">we have a one party system masquerading as a two party system</a>, to give voters the illusion of having a choice and hope for change, but both parties are controlled by the same <a href="http://www.thesurvivalistblog.net/who-really-runs-the-world-conspiracies-hidden-agendas-and-the-plan-for-world-government/" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.thesurvivalistblog.net/who-really-runs-the-world-conspiracies-hidden-agendas-and-the-plan-for-world-government/', 'people who really run the country');" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">people who really run the country</a>. The system is rigged and we don’t have a choice…</p>
<p>And unfortunately, I don’t expect a third party like <a href="http://www.teaparty.org/about-us/" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.teaparty.org/about-us/', 'The Tea Party');" target="_blank">The Tea Party</a> to  ever take a majority of Congress, the Senate or the Presidency, the   people who really run things won’t let it happen or maybe it’s because   the American people care more about the next football game or American   Idol than what is really happening to OUR country…  Nope Democrats and   and Republicans and business as usual…</p>
<p>Want proof, we need to look no further than the recent senate race in KY where “<a href="http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2014/05/in-kentucky-mitch-mcconnell-crushes-tea-party-challenger-matt-bevin/" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2014/05/in-kentucky-mitch-mcconnell-crushes-tea-party-challenger-matt-bevin/', 'Republican Mitch McConnell Crushes Tea Party Challenger Matt Bevin');" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Republican Mitch McConnell Crushes Tea Party Challenger Matt Bevin</a>“… But I digress…</p>
<p>The republicans think that no one will know, remember or care how   that they voted on this, prove them wrong. Take a look at your state and   write down how each one of your “representatives” voted on this and   then you vote to throw them out of office during the next election.</p>

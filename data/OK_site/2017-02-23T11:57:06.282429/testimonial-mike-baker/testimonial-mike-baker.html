<p>Testimonial: Freedom Demands Vigilance<br/>
by Mike Baker</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Constitution was intended by The Framers to limit the powers of the federal government, preserve State sovereignty, and to protect the Unalienable Rights of every American, which come to us, by the way, not from any government, but from God Almighty, the Creator.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Unalienable Rights are Immutable, Natural Rights — the birthright of all Free and Equal human beings. Rights like Free Speech, and the Right to Keep and Bear Arms, predate any form of government which ever existed on earth. The Constitution is merely each American’s personal guarantee from the Framers that these rights would remain “Unalienable,” meaning no lien can be place against it (cannot be aliened), under our American Form of Government. Unalienable rights cannot ever lawfully be infringed, taken away from you, or surrendered by you, under any circumstances. They are yours forever.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Yet today, through stealth and distraction, and by way of a fear-based jingoism that’s been propagandized to an emergency-managed public for decades now, the left-wing, neo-conservatives and their neo-liberal comrades in crime (the “globalist traitors”) have managed to hijack our national government. Together, these criminals are working overtime in a concerted, bi-partisan effort to undermine what little remains of the Unalienable Rights they have not already attempted to deny the American People over the course of the past 20 years.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In my opinion, if the subversives in our federal government don’t like our Constitution the way it is, then they should just leave our country, or at least, pack their collectivist lunch, and follow the steps outlined in Article V of our Constitution, which clearly explains how they can go about changing it. Instead, these criminals, knowing full well that it would be virtually impossible to get our State Legislatures to agree to the outrageous notion that our Unalienable Rights are somehow now alienable, they instead are attempting to usurp our Rights by doing an end around the Constitution, enacting laws, signing UN treaties, and issuing executive orders which can only pretend to do so. You see, folks, nothing trumps the Constitution. It’s the Supreme Law of the land.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The government simply has no power to change the Constitution, or to pretend to repeal any part thereof by enacting any law, or by signing any UN treaty, or by issuing any executive order. In order to change the Constitution, an amendment must first be proposed by either a two-thirds majority vote of Congress, or by a Constitutional Convention. The proposed amendment must then be ratified by three-fourths of the fifty State Legislatures for it to become effective.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As far as the law is concerned, any politician or government employee who has taken the oath of office, and who attempts to enact, implement, enforce, or prosecute laws which are clearly aimed at undermining the Constitution (the very foundation of our government), that person is not only guilty of violating their sacred oath of fealty to the Constitution, which makes them immediately unfit for public service, they are also subject to prosecution for a range of crimes including, but not limited to, perjury of oath.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We don’t need to wait around for the Supreme Court to tell us, as they did in the landmark case, Marbury v. Madison (5 U.S. 137), that “any law that is repugnant to the Constitution is void.” We don’t even need them to remind us that our federal government is “bound” by The Constitution. We already knew this, which is why noncompliance with unconstitutional laws, especially those which are aimed at disarming the People, has now become the sacred duty of all Freedom-loving Americans.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">History teaches us that every evil tyrant who has ever left the filthy imprint of his jackboot upon the face of humanity had to first promulgate laws which were aimed at disarming the People of his country. Hitler did it, Stalin did it, Mao did it, Castro did it, as well as many others. Why? Because they all understood that you simply cannot enslave a well armed population that’s resolved to protect its Freedoms. During the 20th Century alone, over 290 million people were murdered by these left-wing tyrants in bloody political purges. Not soldiers, mind you, but millions of innocent civilians whose only crime was not marching in lock step with a despotic tyrant’s leftist ideologies. They even have a name for it now. It’s called “democide” — death by government.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">What is the militia? It is We The People. Each citizen must have the right to keep and bear arms, because, as the Constitution reminds us, it’s “necessary to the security of a free State.” The Framers fully understood the lessons of history, and recognized that the Right to Bear Arms was a Natural Right — an Unalienable Right — the one Right that would serve the People always as the guardian of all others. Nobody put it more beautifully and more simply than George Washington, who once said, “A free people ought not only to be armed and disciplined, but they should have sufficient arms and ammunition to maintain a status of independence from any who might attempt to abuse them, which would include their own government.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">What we should be talking more about these days is the need for the American People to launch investigations into the subversive, un-American, and otherwise criminal activities that have been going on within our federal government, and the financial sector, for decades now. Until that day comes, and it will, the States must stand-up to their crazy uncle by nullifying any and all of the unconstitutional laws that percolate out of D.C..When the federal government no longer appears to be bound by the Constitution, it becomes the right, and the duty, of our States, our counties, and our local governments to secure the Unalienable Rights of its citizens against all threats, especially when those threats are coming at us from an out-of-control federal government.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Any argument that federal laws somehow trump State laws which are aimed at nullifying unconstitutional federal laws is completely anorexic. Since unconstitutional laws, by their very definition, were not made “pursuant to Constitution” to begin with, which is what application of the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution requires of any federal law. Therefore, where any federal law is clearly repugnant to the Constitution, it should be treated as [null and] void by all Americans — as if it never existed at all.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Our Forefathers didn’t fight and die for more than 200 years to preserve our Freedoms, our Sovereignty, and this country’s Independence just so we could hand our Right of Self-determination over, as we have, to a bunch of foreign agents at the United Nations, letting them dictate to us, as they do, what our domestic policies will be (see UN Agenda 21 and UN Small Arms Treaty), or what wars we’ll fight in (see Libya). Those issues are all for the American People to decide on our own, without any foreign influence, whatsoever.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Let me remind all of you traitors in uniform out there who would dare enforce unconstitutional laws, or who would carry out unconstitutional (unlawful) orders, in direct violation of your sacred oath to uphold and defend the Constitution, that “I didn’t have a choice” and “I was just following orders” were amongst the two most popular defenses offered by the Nazis at Nuremberg before each one was summarily hung. Let’s not forget either that everything Hitler did in Germany was “perfectly legal,” and that’s exactly what every Nazi confidently assured everyone just before he swung from the gallows at the Palace of Justice. Clearly, just because something has become “the law,” or is “legal,” doesn’t make it “lawful” or “just,” which is a higher standard — one which a system like ours — one that’s based upon the Constitution — demands.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Finally, to all of you sheeple out there who are still living in denial about what’s currently happening in America, or who just want to “go along to get along” with “whatever,” and to all of you who don’t have the courage to draw your own personal Line of Freedom in the sand, I want you to know one thing; those who passively accept and cooperate with evil are every bit as much to blame for its continued existence as those who actually perpetrate the evil. So, go right ahead. Crouch down and lick the heavy hand of authoritarianism that pats your woolly head. I promise you. Its weight will one day crush you. History proves it.</p>

POSTSCRIPT</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you find this to be a worthwhile message, spread it throughout the land.  Join with those of us who are dedicated to preserving our Great Republic, not for ourselves, but for our children, and our children’s children, so that they may enjoy the Blessings of Liberty that was the vision and promise of our nation’s Founders. If we don’t work together to change the course of history as it’s now unfolding, Freedom may be lost forever.</p>

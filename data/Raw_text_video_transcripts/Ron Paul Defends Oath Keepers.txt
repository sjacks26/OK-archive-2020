RP: I think what we should do when the liberals. The liberals sometimes annoy me. They get on TV and mock people who talk about nullification or interposition or Oath Keepers.

Caption: Oath Keepers is a non-partisan association of currently serving military, reserves, National Guard, veterans, Peace Officers, and Fire Fighters who will fulfill the Oath we swore, with the support of like minded citizens who take an Oath to stand with us, to support and defend the Constitution against all enemies, foreign and domestic, so help us God. Our Oath is to the Constitution.

RP: Why should they be scared about somebody saying I’m going to obey my oath of office. Or I’m going to obey my oath in law enforcement. Why should they be so frightened? It’s because they think that we use to enforce or prohibit things they don’t like or like. They don’t like what the issue is. But why shouldn’t they be just as interested. 

Caption: Nullification: Doctrine upholding the right of a U.S. state to declare null and void any federal law that they deem unconstitutional.
US Supreme Court: Interposition Implied that the states have a right to interpose their authority to protect their citizens from the unconstitutional measures of the federal government.

RP: There was a time when they used interposition and nullification when the slave laws, the Fugitive Slave laws. There were a lot of states in the North that ignored these things and got in the way of the federal government, said that you have to. What about during the Civil Rights marches, wouldn’t you want somebody in the police force that wouldn’t shoot their neighbors and friends, or neighbors and community because they’re marching against the illegal and unconstitutional law of segregation. We should use that against them.

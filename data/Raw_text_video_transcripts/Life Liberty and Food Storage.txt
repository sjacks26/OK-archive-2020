## I wonder if Numanna is supposed to be new manna, like from the Bible.

JVT: Here in Kalispell, Montana, with Daniel Brigman, founder of Numanna Foods, which we’re starting a new partnership with, in terms of storable food. Tell us about your company and why you started doing this.

DB: Like many of you out there, my family was into preparedness. 5 years ago, we went looking for easy-fix meals. What we found had lots of chemicals, didn’t taste the best. So we started Numanna and made what tastes good to us. 

JVT: You were at Bundy Ranch, helped donate a bunch of food. We brought down a lot, but you were actually on site too. You’re a member of the Liberty Movement, and an author. Tell us about your background there.

DB: (0:01:15.6) My family is very patriotic, we love American, we love the Constitution. When we saw what was happening at Bundy Ranch, we wanted to help. We have a relationship with Joyce Riley of the Power Hour. We took some of our donations and some donations from her listeners, we drove it down there. It was an amazing experience seeing the people dedicated to what we talk about. A lot of people talk about freedom and patriotism. These were real patriots, real liberty-minded people. It was really inspiring. (0:02:01.4)

JVT: You’re supporters of OK and what we’re doing. How important do you think activism is right now? We’re seeing a dynamic period of history. A lot of things are going on at once, land grabs, government overreach. How important is it to support the Liberty Movement?

DB: You look at your children, everybody wants something good for them. It’s the same thing our Founding Fathers went through, they saw tyranny, they knew what it was (0:02:40.2). Through incrementalization, we’ve forgotten what America is, we forgot what got us to this point. The most ground-breaking political documents in millennia reside in America, come from our Founding Fathers. If we abandon that, if we don’t hold on to that, we’re embracing something else. Just recently, I heard about students at the University of Missouri that wanted to take down the Thomas Jefferson statue. I was aghast. That would never happen in America a hundred years ago. All this stuff is happening, we like to blame the presidency, Congress. Everything that’s happening, all the imcrementalization and everything we value being undermined, it’s not their fault, it’s not someone else’s fault. We have to look in the mirror and see what we can do (0:03:27.1). It all starts with us. The jewel that is our liberty, our freedom, it drives everything in our lives. Life is meaningless without freedom. We don’t want someone else’s idea of freedom, we want America traditionally values as freedom. That’s why we’re here.

JVT: Let’s talk about preparedness, specifically with food. My family has been prepping for 15 years, we think it’s a cornerstone. If you don’t have to wait in the breadline, that’s one less facet of control they have (0:04:04.6). How important is it for the average family to have storable food on hand ready to go?

DB: If you have vision, you have provision. If you can see what’s going on and see history and learn lessons from history. An ethic of America was always preparedness. My great-grandma, she always had food down in the cellar. This is an American value. It’s essential for the individual family. Your independence, your self-sufficiency is, you’re freer, you’re more of who you can be, no matter what happens. We’re trying to change the dynamic of food storage. It’s not just the doomsday type mentality. If you lose your job, everybody knows food at the grocery store isn’t getting cheaper. You buy food at today’s price and eat it in 5 years, you’ve paid yourself a financial dividend without even realizing it, because of the price of food going up. This is essential for your economic preparedness, for your overall well-being. We don’t know what’s going to happen (0:05:16.6). If we have a little vision, we can see it’s a smart thing to do, to be prepared.

JVT: Families are feeling financial crunch, and food isn’t getting cheaper. How expensive is it to get into putting something aside very month. Is that difficult for the average American family?

DB: It’s a decision. Obviously, we sell Numanna, we think it’s an excellent product. There are so many other things that are involved, though, rice and beans. Every family can do something. Maybe it’s buy a bag of rice and put it aside. You can do something to enhance your self-sufficiency. Numanna, you buy a big pack it’s about a $1.30 a serving. McDonalds, wherever, it’s a very comparable price. We’re trying to change the mentality of food storage. You know, if it’s an emergency, I’ll eat it. (0:06:33.7) If I’m starving, I’ll eat it. We’re creating food that we think your children will be happy eating tomorrow or in 10 years in an emergency. We changed that mentality, it doesn’t have to be an emergency, we can plan for this, this is food we can rotate and make part of our everyday meal. With those things in mind, if you make a decision and commit, you can do it.

JVT: (0:06:57.9) One of your fliers said that you’re helping veterans in need. Tell us about that program.

DB: My grandfather fought in WW2, got a presidential citation for that. I’ve always had a sympathetic heart for veterans. We want to help those in need, (0:07:31.5) specifically some people in America that are left out, ignored, passed over, belittled, are veterans. That bothers me. As we started to grow, we wanted to donate food where we could to veterans. Veterans sometimes call in, they can’t afford food. We donate food to a lot of people, veterans and those in need. We specifically look to help veterans when we can.

JVT: (0:08:03.6) We’re gonna work more with Numanna. That will be a way you can help support OK, support the operations, feed the boots on the ground, and a way you can help yourselves by buying this great food. A percentage of that is gonna fund OK and our missions and operations, keep us moving forward.

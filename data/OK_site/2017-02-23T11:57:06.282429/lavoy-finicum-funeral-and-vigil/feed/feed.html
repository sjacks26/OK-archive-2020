<content:encoded>I writing this message a few minutes after my other reply to say that my signature number was originally 4443.  When I checked in just before writing my last reply my number was 4444.  Now my signature is GONE!  Is anyone else seeing crazy things like this happening?

<content:encoded>There was someone who pointed out that a bullet struck LaVoy’s truck on the front of the roof above the windshield while approaching the roadblock.  You can see the impact just a little right of LaVoy’s seat.  They talk of damage to the windshield but realize it is a paper on the dashboard.  However, their was an impact and I noticed that when the drone camera later shows the front of the truck the damage to the roof is barely visible.  Everyone should revisit the video.

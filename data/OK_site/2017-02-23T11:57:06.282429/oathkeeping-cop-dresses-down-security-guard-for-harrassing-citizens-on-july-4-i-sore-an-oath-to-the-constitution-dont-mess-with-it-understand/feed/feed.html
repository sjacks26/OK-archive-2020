<content:encoded>“Let’s get this clear, the US Constitution applies only to the Federal government. ”
<p>Because the US Constitution, the Supreme LAW of THIS land requires it of EVERYONE who serves within our governments – state and general.  If one works for the government – state or general (federal) they are REQUIRED and BOUND to support and defend it.  The only difference is the Oath required of those that would be US Presidents, they are held to a HIGHER standard, that of Preserving, Protecting, and Defending the US Constitution.</p>
<p>Article VI: ““… This Constitution, and the Laws of the United States which shall be made in Pursuance thereof; …; and the Judges in every State shall be bound thereby, any Thing in the Constitution or Laws of any State to the Contrary notwithstanding.</p>
<p>The Senators and Representatives before mentioned, and the Members of the several State Legislatures, AND ALL EXECUTIVE AND JUDICIAL OFFICERS, BOTH OF THE UNITED STATES AND OF THE SEVERAL STATES, SHALL BE BOUND BY OATH OR AFFIRMATION, TO SUPPORT THIS CONSTITUTION;…”</p>
<p>I suggest that you read the US Constitution, try to get one that has NOT be rewritten. Also the same for your state Constitution (re rewritten), you will see that ALL who serve within our governments are REQUIRED and LAWFULLY BOUND by Oath to support and defend the US Constitution.  It matters not what governmental position they occupy, they – to be lawful in actions – are REQUIRED to take and KEEP that Oath: dog catcher, governor, LE, postal, DMV, FBI, CIA, NSA, TSA, any governmental agency, etc – the position matters not, they MUST take the Oath.</p>
<p>Also important for any governmental employee to realize is that they ONLY have the lawful authority of the branch that the position they occupy is under.  </p>
<p>EX: The BLM is under the executive branch, the ONLY LAWFUL authority it has is to enforce the laws created by the legislative branch.</p>
<p>EX: Or take state Code enforcement, they can ONLY do the duties the state Constitution assigns to the executive branch.  They can NOT create laws, regulations, etc that are lawfully binding on the people, that belongs to the state legislative branch under the Separation of Powers that our federal Constitutional Republic has at its core.</p>
<p>If the law, regulation, etc is not “in Pursuance thereof” the US Constitution and created by the legislature who are voted into office (others who serve within the legislative branch are only allowed lawfully to assist) then is NOT lawfully binding on the people, it is “color of law”, pretend laws/regulations/etc, it is basically the misuse of power made possible only because wrongdoer is believed to have the power to do so, is clothed with the authority of state though that power was NEVER delegated.</p>
<p>The reason is the US Constitution IS our government (basically) and the highest “contract” that all who SERVE within our governments – state and general – are bound to keep safe as IT is the base/foundation of our freedom and independence.  </p>
<p>These might help you to understand America better. We do not give our allegiance to any person who serves within our government, they are there to carry out assigned duties. Our allegiance is to the US Constitution -it cannot be bought, blackmailed, etc.  It can only be destroyed from within or by making the American people forget it and no longer read or dumbed down to much to understand it.</p>
<p>Ronald Reagan: “I had a copy of the Soviet Constitution and I read it with great interest. And I saw all kinds of terms in there that sound just exactly like our own: ‘Freedom of assembly’ and ‘freedom of speech’ and so forth. Of course, they don’t allow them to have those things, but they’re in there in the constitution. But I began to wonder about the other constitutions – everyone has one – and our own, and why so much emphasis on ours. And then I found out, and the answer was very simple – that’s why you don’t notice it at first. But it is so great that it tells the entire difference. All those other constitutions are documents that say, ‘We, the government, allow the people the following rights,’ and our Constitution says ‘We the People, allow the government the following privileges and rights.’ We give our permission to government to do the things that it does. And that’s the whole story of the difference – why we’re unique in the world and why no matter what our troubles may be, we’re going to overcome”. </p>
<p>J. Reuben Clark: “God provided that in this land of liberty, our political allegiance shall run not to individuals, that is, to government officials, no matter how great or how small they may be. Under His plan our allegiance and the only allegiance we owe as citizens or denizens of the United States, runs to our inspired Constitution which God himself set up. So runs the oath of office of those who participate in government. A certain loyalty we do owe to the office which a man holds, but even here we owe just by reason of our citizenship, no loyalty to the man himself. In other countries it is to the individual that allegiance runs. This principle of allegiance to the Constitution is basic to our freedom. It is one of the great principles that distinguishes this “land of liberty” from other countries”.</p>
<p>Hope this helps, but more importantly I hope this encourages your interest to find out about OUR legitimate government as it REALLY is, not how those who wish to destroy it presents it to the masses.</p>
<p>Stay Safe and God Bless!</p>

<p>If there were never intended to be action to defend the Constitution from those who are domestically attempting to destroy its power and authority, why would each Oath require it of those who take the Oaths? </p>
<p>Chief Tecumseh’s wisdom: “When it comes your time to die, be not like those whose hearts are filled with the fear of death, so that when their time comes they weep and pray for a little more time to live their lives over again in a different way. Sing your death song and die like a hero going home.”</p>

<content:encoded>“Back then up and they will have Your back, as well”
<p>They are lawfully required by their position to “have Your back, as well”.  It matters not what a judge, bunch of judges, representatives, CoP’s (Chief of Police) etc say or order that it is not so.  </p>
<p>They get THEIR lawful authority from either the US Constitution, or the Oath and they are REQUIRED to do as the SUPREME LAW of this land requires of them first because  all laws MUST be in Pursuance thereof it to be lawful and binding on anyone here in America.</p>
<p>The problem is they do NOT keep the Oath to “support and defend” the US Constitution – which is a felony.  They just “follow orders” and “just do their jobs” up to and including *Treason and **Terrorism against the American people.</p>
<p>Consider that the Oath is the ONLY means that any governmental professional law enforcement gets their LEGITIMATE and LAWFUL authority here in America because those who serve within our governments were FORBIDDEN to create a permanent military and governmental professional law enforcement. It is in writing, and it IS a contract that they all are under before any other, including the state Constitution, and the one they sign when they join and take the REQUIRED Oath.</p>
<p>Those that serve within our governments are LAWFULLY bound to use the Militias of the several states so that there could NOT ever be a “police” state, would know that there is NO such thing as “emergency powers” or “martial law”, or even “assassination powers” which IS First Degree Murder done openly here and being used against the people.</p>
<p>Law enforcement – state or general (federal) – replace the people as the Militia, and as Militia replacements their FIRST and most important duties are those constitutionally assigned to the Militias.  Their Oath binds them to those duties.</p>
<p>If they cannot do them as LAWFULLY bound, then we must go back to the Militias so that our nation can be and stay FREE and Independent of world government.</p>
<p>The Militia has as its constitutionally assigned duties to:</p>
<p>— Enforce the US Constitution and each state’s Constitution,<br/>
— Enforce and keep the “Laws of the Union” (which are constitutional laws ONLY),<br/>
— Protect the country against all enemies both domestic and foreign, and<br/>
— “to suppress Insurrections and repel Invasions”. </p>
<p>And they are lawfully bound to do so, and it matters not who “above” them orders them differently. It jsut means that the Oath giver cannot be trusted. The Oath makes them PERSONALLY responsible for their actions. </p>
<p>Enforcing “color of law”, particularly now because they are being used to destroy our nation from within; governmental professional law enforcement are bring used against the people, the nation and most do not even realize it.  But they should, they took the Oath!</p>
<p>This officer deserves the “Oath Keepers Peace Officer of the Year” and much more.  Why?  </p>
<p>He is standing up and fulfilling his duties as LAWFULLY required in THIS nation at a time when it is dangerous for them to do so as their own “brothers” in arms/blue (used to be blue; “arms” because they are basically a military unit right now) may start refusing to come to their aid, if not outright murder them for going against the “flow”.</p>
<p>He will be refused promotions, and drummed out – so to speak.  He needs HIS back guarded by all who can, quite possibly from other officers as he is a rare and precious NEEDED person who one day should replace the TRAITORS we now have in office – state and general (so should others, and the other officers who stand for the US Constitution, our nation.) They/he are/is standing very “tall” and are very much needed.</p>
<p>God Bless and Keep him safe from ALL who would harm him and our nation!</p>
<p>Stay Safe All!<br/>
God Bless!!</p>

<content:encoded>That’s just fantastic I’m blown away by that officer’s outstanding integrity . BUT that’s hardly the norm today we find ourselves more or less captive and scrutinized to the highest legal &amp; moral standard  in the very state we were born in by younger officer’s who think of us as the enemy like we are all guilty and therefor should be treated like criminal’s Maybe had they been working anywhere near Wall street they might not have gotten away with looting &amp; plundering the nation into poverty ..So while we can’t get down the street without a license plate light out without attracting instant law enforcement attention , can you imagine that you shine a Mag light on any license plate and you can see it on Mar’s but have a bulb out and your overhauled on the side of the road . I’m afraid to say a word because of there attitude …

<content:encoded>“It is hardly too strong to say that the Constitution was made to guard the people against the dangers of good intentions….There are men, in all ages….who mean to govern well; but they mean to govern.  They promise to be kind masters; but they mean to be masters….They think there need be but little restraint upon themselves….The love of power may sink too deep in their own hearts….”  –Daniel Webster

<content:encoded>Dear Friends,
<p>As I was reading again the Declaration of Independence yesterday, it came to my mind that by adapting a few words to the situation of today, there hasn’t changed too much since the times of our funding fathers in our civil obligations for the defines of our freedom, our values and our Republic.</p>
<p>( I had the changes highlighted in bold but formatting did not allow.)</p>
<p>When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature’s God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.<br/>
We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed. That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security. Such has been the patient sufferance of these United States of America; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government. The history of the present Puppet President,  Congress and Judicial Branch of the NOW Shadow Government  is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these United States of America. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world.<br/>
They have refused their Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and necessary for the public good.<br/>
They have forbidden their Governors to pass Laws of immediate and pressing importance, unless suspended in their operation till his Assent should be obtained; and when so suspended, they have utterly neglected to attend to them. They have refused to pass other Laws for the accommodation of large districts of people, unless those people would relinquish the right of Representation in the Legislature, a right inestimable to them and formidable to tyrants only.  They have called together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable, and distant from the depository of their public Records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with their measures.  They have bribed and threatened Representative Houses repeatedly to support with manly firmness their invasions on the rights of the people.<br/>
They have refused for a long time, after such dissolutions, to cause others to be elected; whereby the Legislative powers, incapable of Annihilation, have returned to the People at large for their exercise; the States remaining in the mean time exposed to all the dangers of invasion from without, and convulsions within. They have endeavoured to prevent the population of these United States; for that purpose obstructing the Laws for Naturalization and immigration of Foreigners; refusing to pass others to protect our borders, and raising the conditions of protecting the interest of our Nation.<br/>
They have obstructed the Administration of Justice, by refusing their Assent to Laws for establishing Judiciary powers. They have made Judges dependent on their Will alone, for the tenure of their offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries. They have erected a multitude of New Offices, and sent hither swarms of Officers to harrass our people, and eat out their substance. They have kept among us, in times of peace, Standing Armies without the Consent of Us, the People. They have affected to render the Military independent of and superior to the Civil power. They have combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitution, and unacknowledged by our laws; giving their Assent to their Acts of pretended Legislation: For Quartering large bodies of armed troops and militarized Police among us: For protecting them, by a mock Trial, from punishment for any Murders which they should commit on the Inhabitants of these United States: For undermining and jeopardizing our Trade with all parts of the world through TPP and TAP and other secretive and unconstitutional treaties: For imposing Taxes on us without our Consent:  For depriving us in many cases, of the benefits of Trial by Jury: For transporting us into their Gulags under NDAA and Patriot Act to be tried for pretended offences For abolishing the free System of Constitutional Laws in a neighbouring Province, establishing therein an Arbitrary government, and enlarging its Boundaries so as to render it at once an example and fit instrument for introducing the same absolute rule into these United States of America: For taking away our Charters, abolishing our most valuable Laws, and altering fundamentally the Forms of our Governments: For suspending our own Legislatures, and declaring themselves invested with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever. They have abdicated Government here, by declaring us out of their Protection and waging War against us. They have plundered our seas, ravaged our Coasts, burnt our towns, and destroyed the lives of our people with their ongoing deceptive and coward false flag operations.  They are at this time transporting large Armies of foreign Mercenaries to compleat the works of death, desolation and tyranny, already begun with circumstances of Cruelty &amp; perfidy scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages, and totally unworthy the Head of a civilized nation. They have constrained our fellow Citizens taken Captive on the high Seas to bear Arms against their Country, to become the executioners of their friends and Brethren, or to fall themselves by their Hands.  They have excited domestic insurrections amongst us, and have endeavoured to bring on the different races and colours of our nation to seed hatred and racism, whose known rule of warfare, is an undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes and conditions.<br/>
In every stage of these Oppressions We have Petitioned for Redress in the most humble terms: Our repeated Petitions have been answered only by repeated injury. A Prince whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a Tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people.<br/>
Nor have We been wanting in attentions to these Globalist Elites. We have warned them from time to time of attempts by their lawlessness to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us. We have reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration and settlement here. We have appealed to their native justice and magnanimity, and we have conjured them by the ties of our common kindred to disavow these usurpations, which, would inevitably interrupt our connections and correspondence. They too have been deaf to the voice of justice and of consanguinity. We must, therefore, acquiesce in the necessity, which denounces our Separation, and hold them, as we hold the rest of mankind, Enemies in War, in Peace Friends.<br/>
We, therefore, the Representatives of the united States of America, in General We The People, Assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the Name, and by Authority of the good People of these United States of America, solemnly publish and declare, That these United States are, and of Right ought to be Free and Independent States; that they are Absolved from all Allegiance to the Globalist Cabal and their deceptive tool of oppression, the United Nations , and that all political connection between them and the traitors of the New World Order, is and ought to be totally dissolved; and that as Free and Independent People of the United States of America, they have full Power to levy War, conclude Peace, contract Alliances, establish Commerce, and to do all other Acts and Things which Independent States may of right do. And for the support of this Declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes and our sacred Honor.</p>
<p>Be blessed, Steward Rhodes and all Oath Keepers! It was an honor to shake your hand and to re-affirm together with you our Oath in Canyon City on Patriot’s Day. It will always be an honor to stand with you in the defence of the laws of this Republic under this Constitution!</p>
<p>Tom</p>

<content:encoded>In reference to the Sheepdogs and Wolves analogy.  Remember a K-9 is a K-9 all in all.  K-9s can, do, and will interbreed.    The identity becomes blurred, whereby recognizing a wolf is a matter of vigilant observation.  This is no doubt where the saying, “a wolf in sheep’s clothing” comes from.  There actions will betray their intent.  It’s O.k. to be meek, just don’t be mentally weak and unable to defend yourself, your family, and you possessions.  And, remember you possess the right to bear arms.

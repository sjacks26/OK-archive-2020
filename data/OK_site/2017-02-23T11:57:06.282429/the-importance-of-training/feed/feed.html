<content:encoded>Training is the key to success in the CPT endeavor. I have found that there are so many varied and valuable skillsets available, especially in a rural environment, that you can glean any information you need to improve your personal abilities rather easily. That after all is the purpose of the CPT; disseminating skills in order to increase the effectiveness of your community. With so many combat vets and current or former law enforcement in our midst today the wealth of tactical knowledge is there if you look for it. As discussed in the article, proper planning is key to a successful security operation. Seek out the vets with that knowledge and bring them into the fold; many, if not all, want to contribute what they know to their communities.

<content:encoded>To own a gun is great but if you don’t practice on quick draws then it would be useless.<br/>
Multiple guns through out the home, areas of property would be smart, I would think.<br/>
Family practice scenarios beyond those of a fire drill is needed. The lack of knowing what to do would get one killed quickly. I had a co worker one beautiful day who went to lunch came back shook up as he was robbed gun point at a gas station. Such a close encounter to death looking you in the face in broad daylight and people around you are unaware and going about their daily business.  Speaking of, why I am parked in a gas station on wi fi connection isn’t so smart either.

<content:encoded>Training is great but when I graduated at the top of the food chain I got the same cool looking certificate that the guy at the bottom got. Then it was my responsibility to practice what I had learned until I was expert at it. Don’t just stop with the training. Training may give you some bragging rights but top proficiency will keep you alive and well. Prepare for war. Pray for peace. God bless.

<content:encoded>Training can take many forms. Those unable to perform as mentioned within the article above can still assist those “in the field.” There are a multitude of support roles. Be prepared to feed or house a small unit arriving at your locale. Know basic first-aid or more and have the equipment to tend to the injured with some extras to send along with the troops.
<p>A hot meal can boost morale and put a spring back in their step. Maybe you and others nearby of like-mind can perform a diversion to allow escape or completion of a mission. Be creative. Diversions can be a flood of false reports to authorities or a staged car wreck on a major road or… be creative. There is much that can be done to assist freedom fighters.</p>
<p>Best yet might be the efforts of what some label the “Propaganda Corps.” Start now with convincing as many folks as possible of whatever your beliefs are about the many problems confronting We, the People but that the government at its many levels seems to be ignoring or, as some folks believe, actually assisting in being a problem. I shouted with joy when I first encountered Oath Keeper’s Ten Orders. Imagine tyrants via their politician lackeys ordering their “muscle” to commence war-like activities against We, the People. When the troops/police/etc. simply ignore those tyrants what will those unwilling to do the deeds themselves do? Pout? Whine? Whimper? Or make a speech via the elite-owned media accusing free-thinking folks of being the bad guys? Perhaps a war could be won without firing a shot. That is real victory!!!</p>
<p>The complexity of life within the USA today is such that it is impossible to keep track of all that is going on. The America of today MAY simply be too big to effectively governed. Some learned folks suggest dividing the USA into two, maybe more, separate but united entities akin to how states combine to form a unified whole. Is that the answer? I do not know.</p>
<p>This is not the place to declare what I believe are serious major problems confronting We, the People from foes domestic and foreign. What I will proclaim is that from 1995 onward, when I first jumped into the Web, I became a part of the unofficial growing Propaganda Corps and I have seen positive results from our efforts. Do your part, folks. It takes a team and all of us can do something that would have the Founders look down from above and give you a thumbs-up and a hearty “Well done.”</p>

<content:encoded>Training, Training,Training…  Brings back memories of my time in the OPFOR (Hohenfels, GE 1990-92).  As a member of the “original permanent party”, we came in raw from basic Armor school (Ft. Knox, KY).  Trained on M1 Abrams, we found ourselves manning 30 decrepit 1970’s era M60a3 tanks, mocked up as “ruskies”.  Fighting all-comers (US active, US Guard, Germans, Spanish, Canadians and Brits) with the newest hardware, we were never defeated.  Through endless drills, we reduced our load out times from hours to minutes.  Field expedient repairs and thorough maintenance schedules allowed 100% battle readiness, against adversaries who struggled to put up a 75% force.  Spit &amp; polish looks good and gets men killed.  290+ days/year in 24/7 simulated combat, exceeds the field time of any “real” unit in history.  I received the expert badge for tracked &amp; wheeled (HMMVEE) 5,000 accident-free miles and 10,000 hours at the t-bar, the equivalent of fighting bush-by-bush from Baja to Maine.  Every day I died, often multiple times, leaving me to contemplate the wastefulness and horror of war and the sacrifice of our men and women in service.  We saw the useless dog-and-pony units fail (Berlin Brigade, et.al.) mission after mission.  We fought troops fresh from the battlefield of Iraq, and wiped them out with startling ease.  There is no more dangerous opponent than a well trained fighter, free from garrison detail, on his home turf. Training is everything. 
<p>Driving “blind”, by voice commands alone, was the most terrifying experience.  Buttoned up, at combat speeds, in the dark, without night vision for hours at a time… the only relief from the mind’s imagination of a sudden death was screaming into the roar of the engine until I was hoarse. Just because it wasn’t live fire, didn’t mean it wasn’t dangerous, our Post averaged 1 training death per month.  Split evenly between the Observer/Controllers and the visiting troops.  Our training kept us all alive. </p>
<p>Shout out to the men of Delta Tank Co. 1/4 Infantry, 7th ATC      WARRIORS!!!!!!!</p>

<content:encoded>If you want to see a very recent example of revolution in recent times, the Netflix documentary “Winter on Fire: Ukraine’s Fight for Freedom” is well worth watching.  In about 4 months during the winter of 2013-2014, the people — mostly the generation born in the 1990s — toppled the Yanukovych government.  The president was a convicted felon, he refused to honor his election promises, the parliment refused to act and the police beat and shot prosters who pleaded with them to honor their oaths to protect the Ukraine rather than killing fellow citiizens and defending a corrupt government.  The raw courage of the Ukrainian people — and the numbers involved — is remarkable in that they faced down internal security and police without weapons.  Mostly burning tires, wearing football and motorcycle helmets (that the Ukrainian parliment subsequently outlawed), throwing rocks and protecting themselves with tin shields and sticks.  The Ukrainian revolution, like the Arab Spring movements, was fueled by social media communication platforms.
<p>Makes one appreciate what governments will do to remain in power and the wisdom of the 2nd Amendment.  I hope that, unlike their Ukrainian counterparts, our military and police — on orders from higher ups — would not open fire on fellow citizens, but would honor their oaths to defend the Constitution.</p>
<p>Today, we live in a world where people are increasingly dissatisfied with the incumbent power structures — e.g., the top 3 Republicans in the Presidental race have never served in policial office and are riding on a wave of discontent with the state quo.  Whatever else you think of them, the Black Lives Matter movement is politically the other side of dissatisfaction with the current political power structure.  The Middle East has a long string of governments that were recently taken out by the people they were supposed to be serving, and wer’e living with the chaos of the failed state in Syria.  This is, indeed, the Chinese curse of “May you live in interesting times.”</p>

<content:encoded>I hope we see him hanging from his feet in the same fashion Mussolini did in WWII.

<content:encoded>I live in TX and have just seen a story on the news about blm trying to grab land from a farmer on the rio grande. I’m sure it’s more than one farmer but this one was on the news saying they were unrightfully trying to take his land. They are really trying this theft again? Does any one know about this that can help? I wanted to bring att to this to someone that did a fine job standing beside bundy on his ranch but wasn’t sure how..so hope this does it. Wasn’t sure how else

<content:encoded>“It is hardly too strong to say that the Constitution was made to guard the people against the dangers of good intentions….There are men, in all ages…who mean to govern well; but they mean to govern.  They promise to be kind masters; but they mean to be masters….They think there need be but little restraint upon themselves….The love of power may sink too deep in their own hearts….”  -Daniel Webster
<p>Our founders and framers understood back then the danger power has at corrupting people.  The corrosive effect that comes from believing that the government is a kind and benevolent master.  And, that in that benevolence, the restraint of the Constitution on elected servants doesn’t pertain to them.  Our President, congress and courts have so bastardized the simple meaning of the text of our Constitution that it has been rendered obsolete.  Ideology has supplanted common sense in the understanding of the Bill of Rights and many believe the Constitution to be a living, breathing document.  One to be “updated” for the present.  The restraint of that document on our elected servants continues to be eroded by administrations and fellow politicians over time and I fear the only way to rectify the problem, short of civil war, is quickly passing.</p>

<content:encoded>You are the MAN Lavoy Finicum, THANK YOU for your firm stance against the “powers that want to be” known as the feds. Like you said about an empire needing land, it is all about controlling the natural resources, just like the illegal wars being waged in far off nations to steal &amp; control their natural resources. We all need to take a stand against the morphed monster raging against their creators…US!

## Opening voiceover; Michele Gaudin; Tom Wokitz; Stewart Rhodes

OV: Put your seat in its upright and locked position, fasten your safety belt, and hold on. Because the Baldy and the Blonde show is about to launch. Broadcasting from the booth of truth in the WGSO studio in the heart of New Orleans, your hosts for an hour of power, Tom Wokitz and Michele Gaudin.

MG: Oh Shell, Shelly, everybody’s not a statist oaf. They really mean it when they take an oath. And thank god for them, the OK today on Baldy and the Blonde. Yep. Alright folks.

TW: Not everybody is a statist oaf?

MG: Yes, you know people will do whatever the big brother tells them to do. There actually are people who when they raise their hand and swear to god an oath to uphold the Constitution and defend us from enemies foreign and domestic.

TW: They actually mean it

MG: They mean it, yes. Today, we have a prime example of somebody who’s put his neck on the block for our rights. We’re going to be joined today by Stewart Rhodes, a Yale lawyer, former paratrooper, injured as a paratrooper, now runs a group called OK, dedicated to having folks in the military and law enforcement actually mean what they say when they hold up their hand and swear before god to uphold the Constitution. Stewart is going to explain the group he formed, why he formed it, and the certain rules and things, certain orders that they will not follow because they conflict with the oath to the Constitution. That of course is particularly relevant right now, isn’t it folks, based on what our Senate did, including the despicable Senators Landrieu and Vitter who both voted last week against the Feinstein Amendment to the Defense Authorization bill, SB 1867, and voted to allow the indefinite jailing of Americans without charges, without a trial, without a judge, without a jury. If that’s not un-American, I don’t know what is. And who do you think that the brutal people who have passed these laws are expecting to carry out their thuggish laws? Of course, the muscle behind this horrible law, at least in the Senate’s view no doubt, is the military and law enforcement personnel around this country, all of whom have sworn an oath to defend the Constitution and defend it against enemies both foreign and certainly in this case it’s highly relevant, domestic enemies. And certainly when your government says that they can throw you in a prison camp without a charge, without knowing why you’re imprisoned, and nobody hears from you again, you have no judge or jury or trial, that is un-American, and it’s despicable that our Senate and House of Representatives has done this. So without further ado, we do have SR on the line, the founder of OK, you can go to his website, oathkeepers.org. I urge you to do so. This is one of the many patriots in this country who has put his neck on the line for all of us, and all of the members of OK are to be applauded and congratulated. For those of you who have family members in the military or law enforcement, I would highly recommend that you urge them to go to the OK website, see what this organization is all about. It’s all that stands between us and flat out tyranny. Mr. Rhodes, welcome to the show. 

SR: (0:03:54.3) Thanks for having me on.

TW: Hey Stewart.

MG: So I did a little introduction of who you are before you were on the air, your background, but if you could just start off wherever you want, you’ve got the floor, but I would say your background and what caused you to form this organization and what it’s all about.

SR: What really caused me to form this organization is, I was a student at Yale Law School back in 2004, and I wrote a paper on this topic, on the use of military detention against American citizens during the War on Terror. That paper won Yale’s award for best paper on the Bill of Rights, then I became a Yale Research Scholar, writing a book on the same topic. I’m still working on that book, unfortunately I haven’t published it yet. The point is, I could see back then in 2004 where we were going. Already, this is what we need to understand about this Senate bill, it’s not out of the blue. This is the latest step, the latest nail in the coffin, that was already underway under the Bush administration, which detained 2 American citizens, actually did it, detained Yasir Hamdi, an American citizen, and also Jose Padilla, an American citizen. Padilla was quote-unquote captured at Chicago O’Hare airport and detained in the US in military detention for 3.5 years. That case wound its way through the 4th Circuit, and the 4th Circuit affirmed that detention. Then Hamdi’s case, he was captured in Afghanistan but was still an American citizen, wound its way to the Supreme Court, and in 2004, in the case of Rumsfeld versus Hamdi, the Supreme Court rubber-stamped the power of the US government to detain one of its own citizens as an unlawful combatant of the War on Terror. That’s the real betrayal of our Constitution and Bill of Rights, happened back then. I don’t know why, but like the ACLU and other organizations claimed that it was some kind of victory, because the Court ruled that the President can’t just do what he wants, the Court will have the power of review. But the Court also said that nothing in our Constitution that prevents the US from detaining its own citizens as unlawful combatants and further said that if you want to challenge your designation, once the President points a finger at you, he can throw you in a brig. But if you want to challenge it, the Court said, you do have the right to challenge it, but a military tribunal may be sufficient to hear your challenge. You’re not going to get a grand jury indictment, you’re not going to get a jury trial in front of a jury of your peers, as our Constitution, 5A and 6A plainly demand. You’re not going to get a jury in trial for treason. Look, this is a direct violation of Article 3, the Treason clause, which tells you exactly what is done with a person who is American who is accused of making war against the US or aiding and abetting its enemies. It requires a trial in open court. It requires you to either confess in open court or it requires 2 witnesses to the over act. And you get a jury. That’s what the Constitution says. But they threw that all out the window, they threw the whole Bill of Rights in the trash can, and said well, in the War on Terror, the President can do this, but we the Court will have a role to play in what kind of due process you’re going to get. I urge everyone listening to do a Google search for Scalia’s dissent. Justice Scalia dissented in the Hamdi case, and he was joined by Stevens in dissent. In that dissent, you will find what’s the true Constitution, plainly calls for, as he pointed out, was no habeas suspension until Congress suspends habeas corpus, you can’t even detain an American citizen like this. Even then, you could never try one except through the Article 3 treason clause, it would require a jury trial for treason. Scalia is correct, look up Scalia dissent Hamdi and read what he said. He is spot on. That’s the problem, though, the Court, the majority went with this kind of a splitting of the baby thing. Scalia called it playing Mr. Fixit. The Court’s just going to do what it thinks is okay. That’s what I saw at Yale Law School. Both the professors on the left and the right, and the students on the left and the right, it was like a Twilight Zone episode. I was the only one who said you cannot do this to an American citizen, you must try them for treason in a public jury trial. Nobody else there would agree, they all wanted to have this new system of treating Americans the same as foreign enemies. That’s where we are. Now we are talking about. Both the Bush administration and the Obama administration and the Courts and now Congress, all agree that the US can treat American citizens precisely the same, as if they were Iraqis, the same as if you were in a conquered enemy nation. There’s no difference. An Iraqi can go about their business. Say some guy is a goat herder in Iraq or Afghanistan. If he steals from his neighbor, he’s accused for that, he’ll get the normal court system for petty crimes. But if the US military thinks he’s a military enemy or thinks he’s aiding the military enemy, al-Qaeda or the Taliban, the US military would go pick him up, take him away, often to Guantanamo, and that’s where he will sit. If he wants to challenge his designation, they will use a military judge. This does the same, this says the same exact thing can happen to any American that the President wants to point a finger at, or one of his flunkies in DoD, and say that person is aiding the enemy. They can just point a finger at you, you’ll be taken into military custody, no grand jury indictment, no charge, just taken away and held – possibly in Guantanamo – and held for the duration of the conflict. That’s what this law rubber stamped, that’s what this law is giving Congressional approval of. It’s already been done, that’s the problem. The betrayal was back in 2004.

MG: (0:09:55.6) Now Congress has given it the seal of approval, which has made it even worse. Now we have the alleged elected representatives of the US citizens saying, yeah this is cool.

TW: I wanted to bring up a quick point. I’ve heard from several people that say I’m misreading the bill, that it specifically exempts US citizens. I’ve had Senator Vitter’s office tell me that. But that’s not true. If you read the bill, which I’ve done something Senators don’t, I’ve read the bill. I’m going to read one quick phrase here. I’m glad you led in with that precedent. It says nothing in this section shall be construed to affect existing law or authorities relating to detention of US citizens. So they’re affirming what you just said, they’re not preventing it.

SR: (0:10:39.8) No. And what people are looking at when they say that, that we’re misreading it, is section 1032. There are 2 sections. 1031 reaffirms this broad grant of power, and as you say it says overtly that nothing in this section shall be construed to affect existing law or authorities relating to the detention of US citizens. That was the Feinstein amendment that go through at the last minute. How does that help us? The law and authorities are already horrible. Then people look and say that 1032 says that American citizens are exempted from the requirement for detention.

TW: Right, only the requirement.

MG: Just to be clear, we talked a lot about the Feinstein Amendment. You’re talking about the 1456 amendment. Earlier she had an amendment rejected that specifically said this will not apply to American citizens. So later on in the day, she did a catch all that said oh well, basically the law is still the same. The reason the American people think this doesn’t apply, no existing law has changed, is because they don’t know about Hamdi and Padilla, that the law has already been changed.

TW: They think it’s 4A, 5A, 6A that protects them.

SR: (0:11:48.1) Yeah. It’s the laws of war. All of this is under the laws of wars. The relentless steady claim since 9/11 has been that the laws of war can be used on the American people just like foreigners. Back to 1032, that says that some people who must be detained in military detention. They want to force Obama to keep the guys in Guantanamo in the military system, they don’t want him removing them to civilian trial. So it says he must detain non-citizens and non-lawful residents. It says he doesn’t have to detain US citizens or lawful residents. That doesn’t mean he can’t. The discretionary power, which was affirmed in 1031, is still there. That says any person, it doesn’t say any person who’s not a citizen, or any person except US citizens, it says any person.

MG: They use that real broad language of belligerent acts make you susceptible to being thrown in the van with the hood over your head. People are kidding themselves.

SR: (0:12:55.6) Other people say it only applies to those who are accused of being al-Qaeda. Okay, just like all the Nazi laws only applied to those who were accused of being Communists or terrorists. The point is they can point at you and accuse you, and on the mere accusation alone you’re gone, you’re now in a brig. Section 1036, this is what’s really new. The Hamdi court left open how you will challenge your detention. They said it could be satisfied by a tribunal. 1036 in this bill, it says it will be in front of a military judge. Once you’re in the military system, if you want to challenge your detention. You can be in Guantanamo. It will be a military judge who will hear your challenge, not a civilian judge, and certainly not a jury of your peers, as our Constitution requires. This is no different than the 2nd track that the Nazis set up for political opponents of the regime.

MG: It’s obviously rife.

SR: (0:13:52.0) I challenge anyone to find me the difference between the two.

MG: There is no difference. Any President that has a political bone to pick with somebody can just toss you in the brig and you’re never heard from again. The potential for abuse is incredible, and the fact that Americans aren’t even. There has not been one letter to the editor in the Times Picayune about this. It’s all about the Saints and stupidity.

SR: A lot of people across the country are upset about this.

MG: Good

SR: I think that’s a good sign. But they don’t realize how bad it is. The 4th Circuit in the Padilla case was even worse than in the Hamdi decision. The 4th Circuit said that the courts have no business even reviewing it, that the President has total discretion. That’s what Bush argued, that he had absolute discretion. Obama’s doing the same thing. Obama is killing American citizens right now. He has a secret list of people he will kill, designated as unlawful combatants who are Americans. His argument is that Congress has no business even telling him how to do it. That’s why he threatened to veto this bill. He wants total discretion. He wants to be able to arrest you under federal law, or he wants to be able to use military detention. He’s not standing up for the Bill of Rights, he’s standing up for his omnipotent power to do what he wants. That’s the only reason he’s threatening to veto.

MG: I think that’s a really great summary of this horrific bill. Tell us now what you propose to do through OK. If this is a good place, if you want to go there.

SR: (0:15:19.6) We’re having a board meeting tonight to discuss what we’re going to do. If you look back at our 2009 declaration of orders we will not obey, this is order number 3. There’s a reason why this is right up at the top, because this is so dangerous. In that one, we say that we will not obey any order to detain American citizens as unlawful enemy combatants or subject them to trial by military tribunal. We further state that one of the causes of the American Revolution was the denial of the right to jury trial, the use of admiralty courts which were military tribunals of their time instead, and the application of the laws of war to the colonists. After that experience, being well-aware of the infamous Starr Chamber in English history, the Founders ensured that the international laws of war would only apply to foreign enemies, not to the American people. Thus Article 3 the treason clause establishes the only constitutional form of trial for an American who is not serving in the military who is accused of making war against his own nation. We say further that the international laws of war do not trump the Bill of Rights and we reject as illegitimate any such claimed power. Any attempt to apply the laws of war to American citizens under any pretext, such as domestic militia groups the government brands as terrorists, is an act of war and treason. That’s what we believe about this. This really does amount to an act of war, a declaration of war. It gives congressional approval to treating the US exactly the same as conquered, occupied enemy nations like Iraq or Afghanistan. There’s no difference. Our message to the whole military is if you obey these orders then what you are doing is killing the republic. What you’re doing is committing war against your own people and committing treason, cause you’re making war on the US. You have to decide right now what you’re going to do. Either we’re going to be a free people or we’re going down the path of Nazi Germany. I know that there’s plenty of veterans out there who take their oath very seriously, and they’re going to fight. So if you want to avoid that, those in the military and police, if you want to avoid forcing our hand, forcing us to fight back, cause we’re not going to roll over and take this. You need to make a decision right now that you’re going to stand down and refuse at the very least such orders. Once this starts, it will be like a landslide. Once it starts, once they start detaining American citizens and we fight back, that will be it. We’ll be in a revolution.

TW: (0:17:45.9) How many members of the military are in OK and how about police?

SR: Well, I don’t know. We have about 12k members. That’s not really the point. For every one that’s an OK, there are many more who agree and understand. That’s the thing I want people to understand. It’s kind of like an iceberg. There’s a visible tip and that great mass that you can’t see, you don’t know how big it is.

TW: I agree. I’ve met several myself within the last week or so.

MG: Tom met some guys that they’re afraid. Well Tom, you explain.

TW: I don’t know that I even want to say it on the air, I really don’t.

SR: There are plenty. We talk to active duty who say we’re not going to join because we don’t want to make it easy for them to purge us out of our units. We want to be under the radar when it comes to that. So we know, we’ve heard back from active duty right now who are discussing this bill with their command, telling their command they are not going to go through with this if any orders come down. They’re making, already starting to, I wouldn’t say make preemptory refusals, but they’re getting to that point. They’re letting their command know they’re not going to do it. There’s discussions going on right now, and that’s what has to happen. Unlike the German military, in Germany the oath was to the fuhrer, to do. They all swore an oath to the fuhrer to obey him and give their lives to him. They felt oath-bound to do that. Our oath is not to any person, it’s to the Constitution. Yes, the enlisted oath also says I will obey the orders of the President and the officers appointed over me pursuant to UCMJ, but those have to be lawful orders. The Constitution comes first. And for the officers, their oath says nothing except they will support and defend the Constitution, period.

MG: (0:19:34.7) What are guys facing that follow unlawful orders? I think we know that from history, if things go the wrong way for them, they’re looking at Nuremberg, right?

SR: That’s right. If you follow an unlawful order, you are, it’s no excuse to say I was just following orders. That didn’t work for the Nazis at Nuremberg or Lt. Calley in the My Lai massacre either. It doesn’t work. You have an obligation. You’re kind of between a rock and a hard place. You have an obligation to refuse unlawful orders, but you also have an obligation to follow lawful orders. There’s a very good chance you could be court-martialed, like Michael New was when he refused to serve under UN command. He had a travesty of a trial, it was a total joke. He wasn’t allowed to even give evidence to the central question of whether the order was lawful. It was quite the kangaroo military tribunal for him, or commission. So there’s a possibility. Those who refuse such orders may face court martial. Because the current Supreme Court precedent affirms this nonsense, they might even be convicted. But that doesn’t absolve them of their duty to do so. I don’t give a damn what the Supreme Court says.

MG: Right on

SR: What they’re relying on is a 1942 case called Quirin, where a German saboteur, 8 saboteurs came ashore. One of them claimed to be a US citizen when they were captured. FDR refused to turn him over to civilian courts, even though he was a US citizen he said I will not turn him over. The insane New Deal court that rubber stamped everything else FDR wanted and the same court that rubber stamped the internment of over 100k Japanese-Americans, that same court said his citizenship is irrelevant, what matters is what he’s accused of violating. They ruled that because he’s accused of violating the international laws of war, he will not get a jury trial, he will instead get a military tribunal. That’s the court case they’re relying on. The same court that said it was okay to intern over 100k Japanese-Americans, 70k of those were US citizens, the rest were lawful residents. This is the same court. That’s the ridiculous precedent the Supreme Court in 2004 bought, said oh yeah, we already ruled a long time ago that nothing in the Constitution bars, totally ignoring 3A, I mean the treason clause in Article 3, totally ignoring 4A, 5A, 6A. So people have to understand, the Court is complicit. All the branches of the federal government are complicit in the destruction of the Bill of Rights and the killing of this republic. We have to say right now like our Forefathers did back in the Revolution, we don’t care what the Court rules, this is a violation of our rights, we will stand and defend. Look at the Declaration of Independence. The same thing was done to them.

TW: Stewart hang on, we gotta go to break. This is TW, MG, and our special guest SR from OK. We’ll be back with a lot more shocking information for you.

MG: (0:29:16.5) Welcome back to the show. We are honored today to have SR, the founder of OK. His group is formed of military and law enforcement who will not disobey their oath to the Constitution. We were talking before the break about some of the reality of what’s going on now, SB 1876 that we covered last week with Senator Rand Paul. Stewart, what is the reality of the military and law enforcement actually coming to your house, throwing you into a van and taking you away. Is this really a possibility? I’m sure that’s what the listener is thinking.

SR: People say oh, you know, it’s only happened to 2 American citizens, you’re overreacting. Look, the Founders rebelled against the principle, they made that very clear. When Parliament claimed the authority to regulate them in all cases whatsoever, that pissed them off, it was one of the things listed in the Declaration of Independence as a cause for taking up arms. The other thing that was listed denial of jury trial, and ferrying people away across the seas for trials overseas for pretend offenses. Another one was attempting to subject them to a jurisdiction foreign to their Constitution. What’s more foreign to our Constitution than international law? What’s going on now is the same thing. Back then it was courts of admiralty used against them to deny them jury trial and take them away and make them subject to a jurisdiction foreign to their constitution, the British constitution. Here, it’s the international laws of war. It’s the same stuff, the same abuses that they listed as their causes for needing to revolt. It wasn’t just taxation without representation. Hardly. It was denial of the right to jury trial, it was imposition of military tribunals, it was all of that. They rebelled against the principle. Even the claimed authority was enough for them to rebel. So don’t wait for them to actually round you up. By then it’s too late. You have to rebel against the principle. If it’s being done to one American, and they’re claiming they can do it to anyone they want to, then you are like in Nazi Germany. That means they will, all that protects you now after this passes will just be political pressure. Can they get away with it politically? Are you demonized enough? They’ll start with white supremacists, neo-Nazis, or someone else who’s really marginalized in society, who no one likes. Then it will go down from there, before you know it, it will be the militia movement, groups like OK, gun owners and Tea Party people and Ron Paul supporters and Chuck Baldwin followers. All the people who are already demonized in the fusion center documents that we already know about.

TW: (0:32:11.6) Get this. I’m glad you mentioned that. I’m looking at a document now that’s only a few days old, it’s from the London Police. I have no reason to believe they are doing anything different than the US. This is dated December 2, 2011, the headline is terrorism/extremism update for the City of London business community. They list different terrorist organizations, al-Qaeda of Pakistan and guess who else, Occupy London.

MG: Yep.

TW: They’re talking about the Occupy, probably it’s going on here. You can bet that military and police and NSA have all gotten this bulletin, just like they have in London, that the people in Occupy are in the same category as al-Qaeda.

MG: Yeah, but getting back to Stewart, I agree with you that the causes for the Revolution as enunciated in the Declaration of Independence are going on right now. What is, is the military really getting ready to do this? Have they been trained to do this? I’m just being devil’s advocate. I know that’s what people in their cars are thinking, oh come on there’s only been a couple of terrorists they’ve applied this to. Do we have troops that are trained to do it.

SR: (0:33:26.1) Sure, they’ve already got NORTHCOM established, military command over the US. In that command they have, I believe, about 100k standing army, current serving troops, who are deployed here in the US, assigned here for domestic use. Yeah, they do have the military force and structure in place to do this. Now you have military liaisons who are being sent out to all the fusion centers to coordinate with the military, federal law enforcement, and local law enforcement. This is the same thing that happened in Nazi Germany. You had the autonomy of the local police departments were absorbed and nationalized, then they worked hand in hand with the military. You had the SS, which was part of the military, running the police departments. The same thing is starting to happen here. They’re already starting to put the infrastructure in place. Look at the FEMA map for the US, which has 10 regions. Those same regions are the map for NORTHCOM. 10 regions. During any kind of national emergency, FEMA and NORTHCOM will work together, as they’ve already stated very plainly, within each of those regions. They’ll coordinate through FEMA, which is now part of DHS, will coordinate the activities of NORTHCOM and federal law enforcement, right down to your local level, fusion centers down to your local PD. Yeah, the infrastructure is in place to do all this. The only real question left is do they have the political cover and pretext to do it. In Germany, they used the Reichstag Fire to do it, which was blamed on a Communist, they used that as the excuse to pass the enabling act that gave Hitler the authority to set aside, it triggered a clause in the German Constitution that allowed the Chancellor to set aside normal due process. We don’t have that kind of an escape clause for tyranny in our Constitution, but the Supreme Court has created one with the Hamdi case in 2004. They created the authority of the President to apply the international laws of war to Americans. Bush used that to spy on us without warrants, that was the excuse for the NSA spying as well. 4A doesn’t apply to this because he’s the commander in chief and he’s surveilling the battlefield. That military surveillance is outside of 4A. That was the defense. So yes it’s already been used domestically, it just hasn’t been used to the degree that someone would think of in a movie about Nazi Germany. Not yet. But the Nazis didn’t start out that way either, the first day in office detaining everybody they didn’t like. They started by detaining the worst people first, with the Communists, who were a very real threat in their society, then went to the trade unionists, then the Jews, and on down the line. Like that famous quote from the pastor from Germany, I think it was [garbled]. He said when they came for the Communists, I wasn’t a Communist so I said nothing. When they came for the trade unionist, I wasn’t a trade unionist so I said nothing. On down the line. When they came for me, there was no one left to say anything. That’s the trajectory. The legal system is being put in place that’s identical to what the Nazis had. We Americans are supposed to be different. We shouldn’t wait until it’s too late and they’re rounding up your neighbors. You should stand up and reject the principle, the claim that the President is like an elected dictator and can just do what he pleases, point a finger at you and whisk you away to Guantanamo. Don’t wait for it to happen to resist, you need to resist now. We need to stand up now and so no. One more thing I want to make clear to your audience. Back in 1996, long before 9/11, there was a law review article written in the Oklahoma City Law Review, this was right after OKC happened. These two lawyers there, citing the same Quirin case from 1942, argued that Clinton should use military tribunal on McVeigh, rather than a jury trial. They also argued that Clinton should use military jurisdiction, detention, and trial against the militia movement. The argued that they are a military opponent, a military enemy of the US, and the President should use his power as Commander in Chief to use military rules of engagements and military law, under the laws of war, against the whole militia movement.

TW: (0:37:47.2) You gotta be out of your mind to hear all this stuff and to think that these people would respect my rights as an American citizen. When they’re talking about the whole world being a battlefield. There is no way. Listeners, you gotta be honest with yourselves. Read the bill if you haven’t. I’ve read it, so stop emailing me saying that I’m overreacting, that this doesn’t apply to American citizens. I’ve read the bill, it absolutely does. Just read their own words.

MG: And there’s precedent for it, as SR has pointed out. In addition, you can go look at Terror Storm, Rise of FEMA police state by Alex Jones, free on the internet. You will see the troops training to put guns to the heads of American citizens and drag them into camps. I’m not kidding, I’ve watched it. It’s been going on a long time, what SR is trying to do is encourage the military and law enforcement to abide by their oath, to be brave and refuse to follow clearly illegal orders, such as what was done to the people of New Orleans after Katrina, we were disarmed by the military, law-abiding citizens. So you already know from your life experience that this is going on now. It’s not a joke. What good reason could there possibly be? They mean what they say, they’re doing what they say? It’s just disgusting.

SR: (0:39:09.2) They’re already telling you they don’t respect your rights as a citizen. They don’t respect your right to a grand jury indictment or jury trial. They’re already telling you those are out the window. Whenever they want to, they can just do what they want with you under military jurisdiction. I’m not going to wait for them to come get me. If they’re going to declare this. As far as I’m concerned, it’s a 2-way street. If they’re going to treat the American people like an occupied enemy nation, then the American people will treat them like illegitimate military occupiers. The same way our Forefathers looked at the Red Coats. That’s the message to the military and police is, you need to make a real hardcore decision right now. Look inside your soul. What are you? Are you just an enforcer for the power that, the illegitimate powers that be? Are you going to crap all over the American Revolution and our Bill of Rights? Or are you going to do the right thing? That’s your choice. And you’re going to die someday anyway, so don’t say you have to do what you’re told and do what’s right by yourself and your family by following orders. You have to make a decision right now, going down in history. How will you go down in history? As a traitor to your own country and the Bill of Rights? Or as a defender of the Constitution you swore an oath to defend? We’re at that point now. We have to make a decision. I made my choice a long time ago. I know many others have also. We will not be like Nazi Germany, because this country, there will be another revolution. Whether we’ll be successful or not if we have to do that will also depend largely upon the police and military, on whose side will you be on? That’s where we’re heading. I see a very narrow window for a political solution to this, and it’s starting to close. Every one of these Senators has committed treason. They should be bounced out of office, I don’t care what their reasoning is, they didn’t understand what they were voting for, whatever their problem was. In the primary, whether Republican or Democrat, they gotta go. That’s your last chance for a political solution. After that, you will have no recourse but a revolution. Seriously, that’s what’s going to happen. That’s how bad this is. You cannot throw the Bill of Rights in the trash and claim to be a free country. Make your mind up right now America, what are you? Either you’re a free people or you’re not.

MG: (0:41:19.3) I love that. I just can’t think you enough for being on the show. I would encourage everyone, if you have family members in law enforcement or the military, go to oathkeepers.org. If you have any questions, I’m sure SR can answer them.

TW: I think we need to go to break. We went into overtime. We’ll be back in a couple minutes.

MG: Welcome back. We are the champions of liberty, the one and only’s. We have an outstanding champion of liberty in this country, SR, an expert in law and military affairs, who has formed and leads OK, encouraging military and law enforcement all over the US to refuse to follow illegal orders to take Americans’ guns, throw them into detention camps, etc. Welcome back SR. Continue telling the audience where we’re headed and what we’re going to do.

SR: (0:44:58.6) Even at the worst extreme, if the political process is a failure, there’s an example that we see as what we would like to see happen under those horrible conditions. That is the fall of the Berlin Wall in E Germany in 1989. There, you had a tipping point had been reached, a mass awareness in the population of the illegitimacy of the Communist regime. That, when it came right down it, there was mass protest in the streets calling for the wall to come down, calling for the end of communism. And the Communist Party ordered the military to go crush the resistance, crush the peaceful protests. And the military refused. The entire E German military stood down and stayed on base. Without their support, the Communist Party was done, they couldn’t do anything. The Stasi secret police, there weren’t enough of them. They all ran and hid and tried to pretend like they were normal cops and soldiers, they tore off their Stasi insignia. And that was it, two days later the wall came down. So if our Congress is complicit in treason and continues to be so, which they are, and if we don’t, if we aren’t able to solve this through political means, which I don’t think we will be able to, what I hope is that the military will do the same thing the E German military did. Here’s the message to the military: if people who lived under a Communist regime, if communist military people could do what was right, you can do what was right. We have an E German Lt. Colonel we interviewed on our website, named Guenter Spens, that talks about what it was like when they all stood down. Go watch that video. That is what our military must prepare themselves to do, a mass stand down, a refusal to comply, refusal to fight against your own people. That’s the road we’re heading down. That would be a peaceful, we won’t call it a revolution. It would be a peaceful restoration. To simply have the military stand down and refuse to comply, that way we can let it be bloodless.

MG: Restore the republic, yeah

SR: In the end, that’s where we’re heading. Unless we can fix this politically, we will wind up in that position.

TW: (0:47:07.8) I just want to say this about the Declaration of Independence. I think it’s important. This kind of talk can sound awfully radical. In the Declaration of Independence, it talks about altering or abolishing your form of government. But what’s happened is Washington has already done that.

MG: They’re the revolutionaries.

TW: Right. They’re the ones who have abolished our republican form of government. We’re trying to restore it. They’re absolutely radical and revolutionary.

MG: I’m looking at something right now that I don’t know whether you’ve read yet today, SR. Paul Joseph Watson at prisonplanet.com is reporting that they were sent a document confirming that Kellog [garbled] are looking to activate camps built for FEMA and the US Army Corps of Engineers. Have you heard anything about that?

SR: I haven’t, I’ll have to look into that. My focus is on the legal infrastructure. That’s the most. You don’t even have to believe in FEMA camps to understand that this legal infrastructure is being put into place. Right there in mainstream articles you can confirm it’s being done.

MG: (0:48:10.4) Oh yeah. You know that KBR Halliburton posted on their own website that they were granted a government contract to build camps, so. It’s reality.

SR: Right. They say they’re for refugees, that kind of thing. There’s always a dual-use excuse. It’s going to be difficult to find a smoking gun that says this camp is for internment of dissidents. You’re probably not going to find that.

MG: Well I hope that you’re greatly successful in your efforts to encourage law enforcement and military around the country to stand tall and stand down. That’s what we need. I’m sure there are many good men and women out there who meant it when they raised their right hand and swore to god to uphold the Constitution and defend it from enemies foreign and domestic. It certainly seems to me that the majority of the problems are domestic enemies at this point, with a great hysteria surrounding the so-called foreign enemies. And here we are, the day that supposedly would live in infamy. All I know is that when Americans were bombed at Pearl Harbor, they didn’t roll over, crawl around letting TSA feel them up. They stood tall and acted like Americans. This is a time for people to make a choice, as you say. What are you going to do, and what are the people going to do? You too, the regular citizens who are not in military and law enforcement. People have to make a decision what side they’re on.

TW: Alright, Stewart any last words?

SR: (0:49:36.9) One thing for folks to look at is state nullification. Really focus on the sovereignty of your state, how your local sheriff and state governor can also play a serious role in defending you against this kind of nonsense. States have to stand up and do what the colonists did. The colonies stood up as colonies against the king and against parliament. Our states have to do the same thing. Also look there. Don’t just think about.

TW: Let me clarify that for listeners. Nullification does not mean states say that they are not going to enforce federal laws that are merely a bad idea. They’re not going to enforce federal laws that are unconstitutional. There’s a big difference. And we shouldn’t, that’s not uncontroversial.

MG: You can go back and listen to our show by Dr. Tom Woods talking all about nullification, he explains it very well and in detail.

SR: That’s right. You are obeying and enforcing the Constitution when you nullify an unconstitutional federal law or edict by the king.

TW: Yeah the controversial position is to not nullify an unconstitutional law.

MG: Yeah. When you obey unconstitutional laws, that should be the controversy. That’s what we’re expected to do now. I don’t know. When they start throwing you in detention camps and declaring their right to do so before they actually start sending the vans out on the street. Now is the time to resist.

TW: Every week we wonder, how many more weeks do we have of being able to talk like this.

MG: Yeah well, we’re still on the air.

TW: We ain’t going anywhere.

SR: We’re in the same position our Founders were. I encourage people to go back and look at history. Certainly they waited until they had no other choice, but there came a point when they had no choice but to fight back. We’re on that same road. We’ll do our best to avert that, but there may come a point as Patrick Henry said when we have to realize that the fight is going to come, we need to accept that and deal with it.

TW: Before we run out of time, I know we have a lot of new listeners today. Go back to last week’s show, we had Senator Rand Paul on to talk about this bill, SB 1867. If you missed some of today’s interview, it will be available in its entirety on our podcast at baldyandtheblonde.com. Next week, Judge Andrew Napolitano, host of Freedom Watch, on Fox Business Channel.

MG: Stewart, anything you want to tell the people the best place to get in touch with you and learn more about this?

SR: oathkeepers.org. We have a contact form where they can contact me and ask questions. I’ll be posting a more detailed article over the next couple of days. A detailed article about all of this. Hopefully that will answer any questions they have.

<content:encoded>The acceptable practises involved are going to be turning entire towns and cities into stasi like snitch societies targeting and harrassing patriots who wont tow the party line and anyone who disagrees with the current powers that be christians patriots libertarians will be gangstalked by strangers and nieghbors alike ever aspect of your life will be destroyed by dirty tricks lies slander and psychological abuse ie gang stalking smear campaigns threats workplace mobbing intrusive overt surveillance 24/7 and harrasment until you are isolated homeless confused traumatized and ultimately driven crazy and viewed as sub human and and not worthy of decent treatment

<content:encoded>Does anyone have any information that the 190 US cities “chosen” to receive “Syrian refugees” will be participants in the SCN? I live within 10 and 40 miles from 2 of the chosen Cities in New York state and would like a heads up on the UN Invasion. Thank you.

<content:encoded>Hey Charlie Brown. I agree w/ u 100%.  I also wonder how many more years would we have fought, how many more patriots would have died if not for the French assistance? There is no France out there for us this time. EVERY COUNTRY HATES US. We have either invaded them, stole from them, even ‘allies’ gold (Germany/Saudi Arabia/Ukraine), devalued their currencies through our printing/counterfeiting which is way more than advertised otherwise we could never cover the dumped T-Bonds from every corner of the earth (that is the reason for the GLOBAL MELTDOWN).<br/>
Something to keep in mind. Patriots are happy w/ their ‘win’ over the BLM @ Bundy Ranch.<br/>
 I think that was a tactical but hollow victory. It was nice to see people stand up but if someone, say an agent provocateur (like those placed in Ferguson) had fired off a round at the Feds like they did against the cops, everyone there would’ve toast w/in 1-2 days as they’d call in choppers, tanks, the whole 9yrds. Thank god for you guys, all the oath keepers and CSPOA sheriffs, but those young guys im not sure about, many haven’t even read the Constitution. Take a look at those interviewed on youtube videos, even older guys like one Sgt at the inauguration by Adam vs the man, they dont know sh** about it.The good officers have been weeded out and w/ no leadership they will NOT do any different than in NO post Katrina, follow orders or the brig it is.Its psychology 101, its VERY HARD to be the 1st and maybe the only one to stand up to an illegal order. Not only that the mainstream media depiction of patriots is of far right wing redneck white guys carrying around rifles and the minorities like in Ferguson didn’t have a clue other than why are white guys hanging around w/ guns and police dont do crap? They weren’t taught in school, hell they weren’t even taught English so the odds are stacked WAY against us. UN, OVER HALF of the civilians (leftists, minorities, terrorist cells just waiting, god knows what bio and chem weapons that diabolical muslim and limpdik Congress would use to preserve their power. Like already mentioned the Neocons and Dems want war w/ ANYBODY. The only reason why we are not at war is because NATO balked so we sicked the muslims on ’em. 
<p>One other point i’d like to make is that the Chinese have stopped taking dollars in trade for dumping their T-Bonds. We have been giving them gold and PROPERTY. What or who is to say they dont send or activate troops already here to protect their ‘interests’ as they own 1/3 of several MAJOR CITIES LIKE DETROIT, LA, NY (even the JPMorgan Bldng). All the illegals in the news are from Central American, thats where they want our attn but in reality the # 1 immigrants legal and illegal are from CHINA, and it isn’t cheap to get to the US from Chin so somebody had to pay for them.  Obomber met w/ Chinese in Alaska not long ago, for all we know these ‘immigrants’ just need uniforms and weapons. We already know there were over 300,000 Foreign troops training w/ US weapon systems last year (or yr b4) so I think when we start up another war OR we run out of gold to give away or steal to give away ITS ON. Another problem is we have no leader no coordination. W/ the flip of the switch now Obama can shut down the whole internet now (recently in the news). If a leader from the military emerges how can we trust him, could be leading us down the primrose path to death camps. Most of the pop lives w/in the narrow confines of the East Coast which will be cordoned off like lightening. Im not saying we should bow down to tyranny I just think all those guys w/ the molon labe chest thrusted out and false bravado dont know what the hell they’re up against. Whatcha gunna do when they’re piled up 30 outside your house or apt and its just you and the old lady and kids? Its a slaughter fest and will be used to villify every other ‘patriotic terrorist’. Sorry for being so down its just that I fear that the odds are steeper than many think.</p>
<p>I was hoping to stick w/in the confines of the LEGAL system through the 10th Amend and wrest some of the RESERVED POWERS back from the Federal overreach but I think that’s out. The rapidly declining economic situation wont hold up long enough and if it does the Fed and Treasury can print $$ and the States can’t (except Texas) not to mention the ‘new dollar’ they are planning. It IS uplifting to see some State legislation billsmlike the anti-Agenda 21(now 30) and the anti-commandeering bills like in AZ and the anti-NDAA indefinite detention bills passing like in VA but I think that has just sped up their moves, they happen so fast and often anymore its hard to keep up w/ all of them. W/ new regs from DOJ we could most likely be detained for just posting crap like this now. </p>
<p>Our biggest enemy may be our fellow citizens and their cognitive dissonance. Their inability to see things for what they are because they are only exposed to the mainscam media and are too busy trying to make ends meet. Even my grandma whos not all there could figure out the VA shooting was a hoax but doesn’t understand why they’d do something like that so connecting the dots turns into conspiracy theory, we’ve had it good for so long that we’ve been lulled into a false sense of security. As a severely disabled citizen on ‘the dole’ (i DID pay in for 25 yrs at least) I dont have any illusions about making it for long. My back is broken in 5 places and i dont make any hormones and on steroids &amp; o2 so I try to educate and do what little I can do to ‘wake up’ the masses but I can’t get my own family on board so I dont know what good It’ll do other than make me a target. I didn’t wake up until I filed for insurance fraud and discrimination under American w/ Disabilities Act (ADA) not Obamacare. It was over a year and they never did a damn thing even though insurance company and hospital were breaking Federal law and 30 days was the guarantee for a ‘decision’ its been well over a year now.. Anyhow, i hope and pray for the best and salute all you guys that put it on the line for us. </p>
<p>stay strong my fellow citizens,<br/>

<content:encoded>Dot … InterPol (the international police origination) is now allowed to operate in the US without complying to the US Constitution.  Dot … Foreign troops have been invited into the US to work on joint “Disaster/Homeland Security training at US military bases.  Dot … The international SCN joining together to suppress “radical threats” against nations.  Dot … the US has listed various Constitution, freedom, bill of rights, believers in small government, those holding deep religious philosophies VETERANS, etc as reflecting terrorist leanings.  Connect the dots.  Worrisome to me.  Bringing all of these together under Fusion Centers and increasing surveillance brings it to the state of excess worry.

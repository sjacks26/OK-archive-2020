<content:encoded>YAYYYYYYYY!!!!!!!!!    I too cannot make it and it hurts ! my parents were from West Virginia so this was something I wanted to attend badly.  Depending upon the success here, would you consider making this event a national road tour?  I could and would help with housing and meeting halls and other logistical support etc if so!

<content:encoded>How “kid friendly ” is this event?  I’d hate to miss this, but if this isn’t appropriate for my 9 y/o son, I’ll have to pass

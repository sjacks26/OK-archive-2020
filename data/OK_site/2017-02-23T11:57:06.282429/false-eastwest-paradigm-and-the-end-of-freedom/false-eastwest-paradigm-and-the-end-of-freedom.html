<p>People are desperate for leaders and heroes. This is an undeniable condition of human life and of human civilization. Some historians and social observers, however, seem to think it is enough to simply point out this condition and pretend as if they have made some grand declaration; as if they have come to the root of the problem of mankind. In their laziness, they have mistaken a symptom for the cause.</p>
<p>Why do people so often demand leaders and heroic figures? What drives the institutionalization of hierarchy, celebrity and geopolitical idolization? I believe this condition is caused by three factors – fear, ignorance, and apathy.</p>
<p>This is not to say that there are not people throughout history that are worth looking up to, or that looking up to a particular hero figure is wrong. Heroes and sometimes leaders can act as points of reference, helping us to aspire to greater personal accomplishment and extraordinary achievement. The problem is many historical figures labeled heroic are in fact monsters in masks paraded as saviors by history writers with agendas. Real heroes (in the past hundred years in particular) are most often unsung, and remain little known.</p>
<p>This is why the idolization of puppet leaders is so disturbing to those of us in the Liberty Movement. We witnessed the blind militancy of the so-called “right wing” in the support of George W. Bush after 9/11, only to be led into quagmire, economic despair, and a surveillance state based on numerous lies. We then had to witness the insane cult-like fervor of the so-called “left wing” as Barack Obama took office, only to continue and accelerate the same draconian policies of the Bush Administration while conjuring new methods for the division and destruction of American society and prosperity.</p>
<p>Yes, the Liberty Movement has examined every detail and is well versed in the horrors of the false Left/Right paradigm. Again, I’ll have to quote the ever useful elitist member of the Council on Foreign Relations and mentor to former president Bill Clinton, Carroll Quigley, on this particular issue, from his book ‘Tragedy And Hope’:</p>
<p><strong>“<em><strong>…The argument of two parties should represent opposed ideas and policies, one perhaps, of the Right and the other of the Left, is a foolish idea acceptable only to doctrinate and academic thinkers. Instead, the two parties should be almost identical, so that the American people can “throw the rascals out” at any election without leading to any profound or extensive shifts in policy. The policies that are vital and necessary for America are no longer subjects of significant disagreement, but are disputable only in details of procedure, priority, or method.”</strong></em></strong></p>
<p>What truly disturbs me is that our movement can be so awake and aware of the false left/right paradigm while remaining astonishingly naïve and short sighted when it comes to the false East/West paradigm. And once again, I have to attribute this naivety to a desperation for heroes caused by fear and apathy.</p>
<p>I have written on the reality that Eastern political interests are just as controlled by globalists as Western political interests for years. Readers can review the considerable amount of data and evidence I have collected on Russia and Vladimir Putin in particular and the ties between the East and international financiers and well known globalists in recent articles such as ‘<a href="http://www.alt-market.com/articles/2074-russia-is-dominated-by-global-banks-too" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.alt-market.com/articles/2074-russia-is-dominated-by-global-banks-too', 'Russia Is Dominated By Global Banks, Too');">Russia Is Dominated By Global Banks, Too</a>‘, ‘<a href="http://www.alt-market.com/articles/2126-false-eastwest-paradigm-hides-the-rise-of-global-currency" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.alt-market.com/articles/2126-false-eastwest-paradigm-hides-the-rise-of-global-currency', 'False East/West Paradigm Hides The Rise Of Global Currency');">False East/West Paradigm Hides The Rise Of Global Currency</a>‘, and ‘<a href="http://www.alt-market.com/articles/2168-the-new-world-order-and-the-rise-of-the-east" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.alt-market.com/articles/2168-the-new-world-order-and-the-rise-of-the-east', 'The New World Order And The Rise Of The East');">The New World Order And The Rise Of The East</a>‘.</p>
<p>In fact, <a href="http://www.alt-market.com/articles/2712-syrian-crisis-what-will-happen-next" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.alt-market.com/articles/2712-syrian-crisis-what-will-happen-next', 'I predicted almost every aspect');">I predicted almost every aspect</a> of the current Syrian crisis based on the knowledge that the East versus West dynamic was purely an engineered conflict designed to diminish American power and economic influence through the use of planned chaos, and I did this years before events were ever triggered in the region.</p>
<p>I knew what was about to happen in Syria only because I understood one important fundamental – that there are no “sides” in any modern conflict, only proxies fighting on a global chessboard controlled by the same elitist interests. Syria represented a perfect catalyst for a planetary scale conflict triggered between East and West in way that could divert attention from internationalists. Modern war, whether through kinetics or economics, is almost always theater designed to distract and terrorize the masses, which are the true target of any conflagration.</p>
<p>We must set aside childish assumptions on war. Wars are not about resources. They are not about territory. They are not about the hegemony of any particular nation state. If you buy into such notions, you have been duped. No, war is about something much bigger. War first and foremost is a tool for the manipulation and molding of public psychology. As Edward Bernays, the father of modern propaganda said:</p>
<p>“<em><strong>The great enemy of any attempt to change men’s habits is inertia. Civilization is limited by inertia.”</strong></em></p>
<p>War is meant to forcefully change the “inertia” of civilization, and thus, forcefully change the direction of civilization in a manner that benefits the engineers of the conflict.</p>
<p>One great threat to the mechanism of globalism and the elites behind it is the liberty movement, which is slowly but steadily growing in popularity and influence as America edges ever closer to economic and sociopolitical oblivion. As the U.S. is homogenized, harmonized, and brought down to third world status for the benefit of a one-world system, resistance continues to grow.</p>
<p>You see, one negative side-effect of the rush towards centralization and a single global power (often referred to by the elites as the “New World Order”) is that the harder the globalists push society toward their Utopian ideal, the more individuals (not controlled governments or political puppets) wake up to the threat. Every action has an equal and opposite reaction. The Liberty Movement is the equalizing reaction to forced globalization.</p>
<p>In order for the elites to neutralize the threat we present, they must either destroy us or co-opt us. I believe the East/West paradigm is being used in part to attempt the co-option of liberty elements.</p>
<p>Despite the fact that many liberty analysts are beginning to understand the nature of the false East/West paradigm and the truth behind the rise of Russia, the predictable escalation in Syria is energizing a strange brand of Putin-worship once again. Liberty elements WANT to believe that Putin is somehow in opposition to globalization, that he is somehow morally superior to the Obama Administration, and that Russia is on the side of right in the fight against ISIS and the evil Western empire.</p>
<p>They want to believe this because they are afraid – they are afraid that they are alone in the fight against the NWO. They are afraid that they will have to commit to personal sacrifice and struggle against a vastly technologically superior opponent. They are afraid that they alone will have to take responsibility for America’s destiny and that no great leader on a white horse is coming to blaze the path ahead of them.</p>
<p>Because of this fear, they sometimes commit the crime of cognitive dissonance in order to protect their false belief in a heroic Putin. They will ignore the fact that Putin is a long time <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/20/world/europe/henry-kissinger-to-meet-with-vladimir-putin-in-russia.html" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/20/world/europe/henry-kissinger-to-meet-with-vladimir-putin-in-russia.html', 'friend of Henry Kissinger');">friend of Henry Kissinger</a>, the most publicly vocal proponent of the “New World Order, and that Putin describes Kissinger as his “trusted foreign policy adviser”.</p>
<p>They will ignore the fact that Russia’s primary economic adviser is none other than the hitman of the international banking syndicate, <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-02-06/goldman-sachs-shouldn-t-work-for-russia-human-rights-group-says" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-02-06/goldman-sachs-shouldn-t-work-for-russia-human-rights-group-says', 'Goldman Sachs');">Goldman Sachs</a>, and that Goldman Sachs has been deeply involved in Russia’s economic affairs <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/business/1992/02/18/russia-hires-goldman-sachs-as-adviser/0493d5e0-07ec-4e19-80c7-3e950cafb7a2/" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/business/1992/02/18/russia-hires-goldman-sachs-as-adviser/0493d5e0-07ec-4e19-80c7-3e950cafb7a2/', 'since at least 1992');">since at least 1992</a>, just after the fall of the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>They will ignore the fact that Putin and Russia have allied closely with the IMF (an institution supposedly dominated by the U.S.). Putin and the IMF are so intertwined that it was <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/russia-ukraine-seek-bailout-loan-imf-082309440--finance.html" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://news.yahoo.com/russia-ukraine-seek-bailout-loan-imf-082309440--finance.html', 'Putin who demanded');">Putin who demanded</a> that the IMF take over the management of Ukraine’s finances after the regional crisis began, and, it was the IMF that <a href="http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2015-06-23/the-imf-bows-to-putin-in-ukraine" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2015-06-23/the-imf-bows-to-putin-in-ukraine', 'blatantly supported');">blatantly supported</a> Putin’s call for a change in Ukraine’s bond status from private to “official”. Russia also demanded that Ukraine’s debts be repaid in Special Drawing Rights, the global currency basket which the IMF plans to use to replace the U.S. dollar as the world reserve mechanism.</p>
<p>They will also surely ignore the fact that Putin and the Kremlin have on multiple occasion called for the IMF to take over global management of the worlds financial systems through the implementation of the SDR as the <a href="http://www.themoscowtimes.com/business/article/at-g20-kremlin-to-pitch-new-currency/375364.html" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.themoscowtimes.com/business/article/at-g20-kremlin-to-pitch-new-currency/375364.html', 'new world reserve currency');">new world reserve currency</a>.</p>
<p>And of course, the fact that Russia is a member of the Bank for International Settlements and the BIS is the policy dictator of ALL central banking (do I really need to quote Carroll Quigley on the BIS yet again?) does not bode well for the affiliations and intentions of Russia as a whole, yet we are still bombarded in the liberty movement with platitudes on how Putin is “sticking it to the bankers”. No, I’m afraid not. According to the evidence, Putin is just like Obama: Yet another whore for the internationalists. Post all the pictures you want of the guy holding an uzi or finishing a judo throw, but his public persona does not fit reality.</p>
<p>The mainstream media in the U.S. has for the most part run on the narrative that Putin is the next Stalin, and if you are going to perpetuate a false East/West paradigm this makes perfect sense. But there is also a separate narrative being presented to the liberty movement and the rest of the world.</p>
<p>The talking points coming out of outlets like RT (Russia Today), a media machine controlled by the Russian government, has for the past few years stolen brilliant observations by American liberty proponents and repackaged them as video fluff. Most of these observations are negative in their view of U.S. government policy as well as central banking dictatorship, and they are also entirely correct. The problem is, RT does not apply the same standards of journalistic skepticism to the Russian government or its ties to the central banking cabal.</p>
<p>Time Magazine publishes pro-Putin articles naming him “man of the year” in every other nation where they have distribution, but removes these stories and covers when publishing in America.</p>
<p>The general American public is being sold on the idea that Putin is a calculating danger to global stability and that Western governments must become more aggressive to counter the threat. The rest of the world and the liberty movement are being sold on the image of a benevolent Putin and a Russia standing firm against the corrupt war machine of the West, but this image simply is not real.</p>
<p>The danger for the liberty movement in the near future is considerable. Our blind support of the false East/West paradigm makes us vulnerable to easy co-option, for if we as a movement are tricked into closely affiliating with Russia then we lose our identity as a force for American independence and become nothing more than an “Eastern created” faux revolution. Think it can’t happen? Mainstream media outlets are ALREADY building the narrative. The Atlantic was the first, <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2014/09/russia-putin-revolutionizing-information-warfare/379880/" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2014/09/russia-putin-revolutionizing-information-warfare/379880/', 'with an article');">with an article</a> directly connecting “right wing” movements and “conspiracy theorists” in the U.S. with Russian influence and propaganda.</p>
<p>As the false East/West confrontation grows, the real purpose of such a crisis will become apparent. ISIS agents conveniently shipped out of Syria among millions of “refugees” before Russian forces finally decided to strike will wreak havoc in Western nations. Economic chaos will become prevalent.  The U.S. will lose the dollar’s petro-status as the East subsumes Eurasia.  Fear of another world war will haunt public perception. The ever uneducated and terrified mass majority will become far less tolerant of intelligent dissent. And, the Fabian Socialists infesting global institutions will suggest a clever solution to the problem they created – the dissolution of all sovereign nations and the complete centralization of governance into the hands of a select few to save humanity from such destructive divisions.</p>
<p>If you understand that a primary goal of globalists is to fully remove constitutional protections in America and assert a totalitarian framework, then you have to admit that a conflict with Russia is an excellent opportunity for them.  War fever makes men delirious and malleable, and outside threats make internal despotism more tolerable.</p>
<p>In the meantime, if the liberty movement refuses to treat Russia with the same x-ray vision it has used against western governments (a Russia clearly working with international financiers and globalist institutions) then we make it far easier for the elitist propaganda machine to paint us as Eastern backed traitors rather than freedom fighters down the road, thus crushing our chances at garnering increased support from the public and awakening new voices.</p>
<p>Mark my words, in the end we will not only be forced to rebel against centralization under our own criminal government; we will also have to rebel against criminal puppet governments everywhere. I have no doubt that when we see the ranks of the globalist enemy, there will be Russian faces standing right alongside Western oligarchs. Maybe then people will finally admit that the East/West crisis was a carefully crafted hoax all along.</p>

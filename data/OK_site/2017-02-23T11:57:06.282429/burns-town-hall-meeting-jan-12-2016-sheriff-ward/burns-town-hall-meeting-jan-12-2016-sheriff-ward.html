<p>Sheriff begins speaking at 34:05 into the video:</p>
<blockquote><p>I would like to ask these folks to go home and let’s work through this peacefully.  I don’t want to stand up here and talk about an investigation that’s going on.  I don’t want to put details out there, but the fact is that there’s an hour glass and it’s runin’ and times gonna run out, so we need to work through this sooner than later.  Please go home.</p></blockquote>
<p>The Sheriff did not elaborate on what he meant, but it is cause for concern.   What is the rush?  The Feds need to handle this like the Montana Freeman standoff, or like the handled the Indian MOVE occupation of Alcatraz,   There is no emergency, unless the Feds create one.   Ammon and his guys are out in an empty building, in the middle of nowhere.</p>
<p>As Dr. Edwin Vieira pointed out in a comment on this site, what Ammon and crew are doing is essentially a civil disobedience sit-in like the left has been doing for decades, in college Dean offices and government offices all over the country.  These cowboys and veterans just happen to be armed, as we Westerners tend to be.  People need to get over it and chill out.   There are no hostages, there are no close-by neighbors, there is nobody there except those who want to be.  Nobody is in danger unless the Feds do something stupid.   Ammon Bundy himself has dialed back the rhetoric, and that of his men, and is now asking everyone to deescalate and not have long guns out, and basically just relax.</p>
<p>And hopefully that is what happens.  The problem is, the left is screaming for blood, screaming for Obama to do something to put a stop to it, sooner rather than later, to show us who’s boss.</p>
<p>When watching this video, keep in mind that nearly half the town works for the Feds, such as BLM.  Apparently, even the Sheriff used to be a BLM man.   The other half are ranchers and such who actually create wealth, rather than just sucking up ours through government paychecks.   So it is split.  half Loyalist “Tory,” half patriot.   And that is why this pubic meeting is so stridently anti-Bundy.   Word from our guys on the ground, including Oath Keepers BOD member SGM Joseph Santoro (Ret.), is that there is a great deal of support among the actual ranchers and others who don’t work for the Feds.  That throws a new light on it.   Those ranchers need to get to these public meetings so the nation doesn’t get an inaccurate perception of local sentiment.</p>
<p>We live in interesting times.</p>

<p>PS – and as for Pete Santilli being kicked out, after interrupting the speaker, and then trying to say he has a First Amendment protected right to do so, he doesn’t seem to understand how free speech at a public speaking event works.  Yes, he has a right to free speech, but so does the speaker, and when he interrupts a speaker, he is infringing on that person’s right to free speech.  Doesn’t matter if you don’t like his speech.  Doesn’t matter if you think he, or the other speakers, are failing to talk about things you think should be discussed.  They have a right to be statist-minded idiots if they want to.  Then during questions, you can ask the hard questions.  That’s how it works.  Kinda like on a talk show.   Someone can’t barge into the host’s studio and take over the mic because the host is not talking about things he wants discussed.   He can call in and wait to ask a question, but he has no right to override the host’s speech.  And interrupting a speaker is also not the best thing to do if you are trying to win the hearts and minds of the locals and it makes it easier for the opposition to demonize you.</p>

<p>by Shorty Dawkins</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">A valuable lesson can be learned from a law that was recently enacted in Turkey. The following is a brief article from PressTV that is very telling. First the article, then the lesson.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.presstv.ir/detail/2014/01/19/346473/controversial-bill-becomes-law-in-turkey/" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.presstv.ir/detail/2014/01/19/346473/controversial-bill-becomes-law-in-turkey/', 'From PressTV');" target="_blank">From PressTV</a>.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A controversial medical aid law has come into force in Turkey, criminalizing the provision of emergency first aid without government authorization. </strong></p>
<p>The law took effect on Saturday, one day after the bill was signed into law by President Abdullah Gul.</p>
<p>Under the law, those convicted could face a three-year jail term or a fine of up to nearly USD 1 million.</p>
<p>The move has sparked an outcry from human rights activities fearing that the law could be used by police to intimidate medics treating protesters injured in anti-government demonstrations — like those that rocked Turkey in 2013.</p>
<p>Physicians for Human Rights (PHR) has described the law as another attempt by the government of Prime Minster Recep Tayyip Erdogan to silent dissent.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Passing a bill that criminalizes emergency care and punishes those who care for injured protesters is part of the Turkish government’s relentless effort to silence any opposing voices,” said PHR senior medical advisor, Vincent Iacopino, who added, “This kind of targeting of the medical community is not only repugnant, but puts everyone’s health at risk.”</p></blockquote>
<p>UN Special Rapporteur on the Right to Health Anand Grover, said days before the law came into effect that if adopted, “it will have a chilling effect on the availability and accessibility of emergency medical care in a country prone to natural disasters and a democracy that is not immune from demonstrations.”</p>
<p>During the nationwide protests of 2013, the Turkish doctors’ association repeatedly accused government forces of preventing medics from treating injured people.</p>
<p>Six people died and some 8,000 others were injured in clashes between police and anti-government protesters last year. {end of PressTV article.}</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Now the lesson.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Turkey has been rocked by massive demonstrations. Thousands have been injured and six have died in the sometimes violent demonstrations. The demonstrators are demanding the resignation of Prime Minister Erdogan. What is his response? He has stated he will not resign. He will stay in power.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">The law concerning not giving first aid unless authorized by the government, and the severity of the punishment, can have no purpose other than to stifle dissent. It certainly makes no sense from a humanitarian position. This is an extreme example of those in power doing anything to remain in power. This is what politicians, Parties, dictators, and thugs do. Their goal is to attain enough power to keep them in place, regardless of the will of the people. Turkey is presumed to be a democratic nation, however, just as Obama is busy ruling by decree, with his Executive Orders, Erdogan, and those holding power in Turkey, are putting the squeeze on dissent.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">For those who still hold the belief that government is good and cares for the general populace, what has happened in Turkey should be an eye-opener. I say should be because many will still blindly believe in government’s benevolence, though experience always, in the end, shows otherwise.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Our founders wrote a Constitution that was an attempt to limit the power of the General Government, (Federal government), because they recognized the abuse of power that would ensue, if left unchecked. Throughout the late nineteenth and the whole of the twentieth centuries, there has been a concerted effort to undermine the Constitution. Those who proclaim the Constitution is out-dated, are the ones seeking to undermine it and make it irrelevant. If government is to be kept in control, the separation of powers must be upheld. It is not just the separation of powers within the Federal Government that must be upheld, it is also the separation of powers delineated in the Constitution between the States and the Federal government. The powers granted to the Federal Government in the compact of the States which formed it must be adhered to.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Tyranny comes in many guises. It is up to us to recognize it, and to deal with it.</p>

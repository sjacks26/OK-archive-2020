<content:encoded>I would like to become a member of your movement we all have rights and if no one is willing to protect our rights Then they wont exist so many men and women gave their lives and i just cant sit back and let them have done it all for nothing.  we can ether be cattle like most of society…but if you ask me there are too many of those so lets stand together and  be the bull that looks over the cattle And protects them from the wolves so we can raise our children free. My name is thomas miracle and i am proud to be american but i am ashamed of our governments actions to our people in order to generate revenue. dont forget the people who founded this great country were considered criminals for standing up for what they believed in so don’t be ashamed when they call us criminals Take pride in the fact you are doing what you believe in My grandmother told me son stick to your guns for what u believe in no matter what. its better to die for what you believe in Than to live a life of someone that your not ….. My number is 402-805-6006  my name is Thomas miracle We cant fix this with violence we can only fix this with education of our rights to the people  and we will have to stand up and protect those rights. I will end this with a quote from a great movie …you may take my life but you will never take my freedom

<content:encoded>I swore my Oath back in 1979 and wish to become an active member; with the drastic and tyrannical state of this administration Patriots must unite to protect the freedoms of the American people we have so long took for granted.
<p>For a people who are free, and who mean to remain so, a well-organized and armed militia is their best security.<br/>

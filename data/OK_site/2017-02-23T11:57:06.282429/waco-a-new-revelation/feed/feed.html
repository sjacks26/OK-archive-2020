<content:encoded>Thank you Publius40 for the info about the Waco Museum, I will certainly visit the site and pass on the link to my family and friends. Sharing info with each other on these forums is crucial in order to keep abreast of the horrors that are taking place in this country.

<content:encoded>Thank you so much Elias for your valuable input into the tragic events of Waco and the ongoing downfall of America through demonic agents who represent Satan here on earth.<br/>
I remember seeing the Waco tragedy on tv all those years ago and remember at the time how evil it was that the government was attacking a group of people just because of their beliefs. Although at the time I recall we were told it was because David Koresh and his group were stock piling weapons which was supposed to be against the law. Nevertheless most everyone I knew at that time were all horrified at the diabolical slaughter of so many innocent people….and as for me, I will always remember it. I will also make sure my friends and family are reminded of what a sinister corrupt government can inflict on its people.<br/>
Thank you again for making this information and the video available as a reminder to all.<br/>
Mary S.

<content:encoded>Amen. All evidence was destroyed, hidden, or buried, including that metal door which would have shown all the bullet hole flanges opening on the inside of the door instead of on the outside of the door. The bullets which went through that door all came from the ATF, and the sons of bitches running ATF today still lie about that, while the FBI says it can’t find the door. Methinketh that door is buried under guard, with the rest of the wreckage they bulldozed up and buried to hide all evidence. They did that because the government itself knew the ATF and FBI were lying through their teeth and that forensic investigation would reveal the truth about the assault. 
<p>Salute!<br/>

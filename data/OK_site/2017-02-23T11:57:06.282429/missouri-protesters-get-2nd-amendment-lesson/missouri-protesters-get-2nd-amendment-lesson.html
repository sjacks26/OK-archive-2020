<p>Protesters in Ferguson, Missouri, are getting a lesson on the Constitution, a document most of them seem completely unaware of.</p>
<p>The lesson is coming from members of the Oath Keepers organization who showed up in the city Tuesday donning protective vests with handguns holstered on their belts and carrying those rifles with 30-round magazines that so frighten leftist gun grabbers, bed wetters and the social Marxist collectivists elites. Missouri is an open-carry state.</p>
<p>According to media reports, the Oath Keepers were confronted by protesters asking why they were allowed to openly carry weapons. “I’m happy that we’re able to defend ourselves,” one unidentified Oath Keeper <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/michael-brown-shooting/oath-keepers-turn-michael-brown-protests-ferguson-missouri-n407696" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/michael-brown-shooting/oath-keepers-turn-michael-brown-protests-ferguson-missouri-n407696', 'replied');" target="_blank">replied</a>. “It’s been our right for a long time.”</p>
<p>Actually, given that self-defense is a natural right, it has always been there. And both the U.S. Constitution and the Missouri State Constitution provide protections designed to remind government functionaries of its presence. Unfortunately, St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar is apparently unfamiliar with the concept, as well as the constitutions of the United States and Missouri.</p>
<p>Commenting to a reporter from the laughably incompetent, state-propaganda-media <a href="http://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/heavily-armed-oath-keepers-inject-new-unease-to-riot-hit-ferguson/ar-BBlDm8L" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/heavily-armed-oath-keepers-inject-new-unease-to-riot-hit-ferguson/ar-BBlDm8L', 'Reuters');" target="_blank">Reuters</a> news agency Belmar condemned the Oath Keepers’ presence and vowed to work with prosecutors to see if the men had broken any laws.</p>
<p>The men were there to protect a journalist from the Infowars.com website who was in Ferguson covering the rioters who were making mischief on the anniversary of Michael Brown’s death, according to one of the men who identified himself to media only as John. But Alex Jones of Infowars said the website had not asked Oath Keepers for protection.</p>
<p>During the height of protests in the wake of the grand jury’s decision not to indict officer Darren Wilson in Brown’s death, Oath Keepers <a href="http://personalliberty.com/ferguson-conundrum-solved-community-security/" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://personalliberty.com/ferguson-conundrum-solved-community-security/', 'protected');" target="_blank">protected</a> a number of stores from looters, providing a service the local police were either unable or unwilling to perform.</p>
<p>If you are unfamiliar with them, Oath Keepers is group of current and former military, law enforcement and first responders who have vowed to uphold their oaths to the Constitution and oppose all Constitutional encroachments. They “declare that they will not obey unconstitutional orders, such as orders to disarm the American people, to conduct warrantless searches, or to detain Americans as ‘enemy combatants’ in violation of their ancient right to jury trial.”</p>
<p>Of course, media reports on the Oath Keepers’ presence were not without information from the anti-freedom, anti-constitutional governance organization, the Southern Preposterous Lie Center, which called Oath Keepers a “fiercely anti-government, militaristic group.” Because, as we all know, standing for the Constitution is “fiercely anti-government” in the minds of statist progressives.</p>
<p>As a reminder and for St. Louis County Police Chief Belmar’s and the county prosecutors’ edification, the 2<sup>nd</sup> Amendment reads:</p>
<blockquote><p>A well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.</p></blockquote>
<p>And from the Missouri State Constitution, Article 1, Section 23:</p>
<blockquote><p>That the right of every citizen to keep and bear arms, ammunition, and accessories typical to the normal function of such arms, in defense of his home, person, family and property, or when lawfully summoned in aid of the civil power, shall not be questioned. The rights guaranteed by this section shall be unalienable. Any restriction on these rights shall be subject to strict scrutiny and the state of Missouri shall be obligated to uphold these rights and shall under no circumstances decline to protect against their infringement. Nothing in this section shall be construed to prevent the general assembly from enacting general laws which limit the rights of convicted violent felons or those adjudicated by a court to be a danger to self or others as result of a mental disorder or mental infirmity.</p></blockquote>

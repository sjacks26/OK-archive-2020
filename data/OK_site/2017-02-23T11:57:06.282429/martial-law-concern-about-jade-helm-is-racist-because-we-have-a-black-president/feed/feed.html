<content:encoded>It has always troubled me that this president does not recognize his white heritage.  After all he was, in great part, raised by his white grandparents. I have resigned myself to the fact that it does not fit his agenda. What it seems to reveal to me is a schizophrenia within him which does not condone or instigate racism, but rather it is a “racialism” that drives him to divide the races as his mind is divided.  This makes so much sense to me, yet I am welcome to constructive remarks both positive and negative.  Respectfully yours…..

I think they are getting through dress rehearsal and ready to go live.It so peeves me  that a small group of people are so Satanically sick that they would put billions of lives on the line to accomplish their selfish will.

<content:encoded>Dr. Vieira is correct, as always.
<p>But he even says that we are to replace the people who have gone against the “contract(s)” (my words) they are under, not to throw out the Constitution of the United States of America.  </p>
<p>The problem we are having is because:</p>
<p>The PEOPLE did not do their duty as the Militia, which are constitutionally REQUIRED;</p>
<p>Or as the original authority from which all delegated duties come, by enforcing those that serve within the federal and state governments and removing, prosecuting those that were/are corrupt; </p>
<p>Did not use the “Good Behaviour” requirement to remove judges who did NOT keep their Oaths and constitutionally assigned duties;</p>
<p>Have not used/been using the Grand Jury for investigations or trials of those who serve in any capacity.  It is our tool to call, use not the tool of those that SERVE within our governments whatever branch their duties fall under; </p>
<p>Thomas Paine: “Those who expect to reap the benefits of freedom, must, like men, undergo the fatigue of supporting it.” </p>
<p>Have NOT taught our children the basics of our government and what THEIR responsibilities are within it. Allowed them to be mis-educated, “dumbed down”, and taught to be “good citizens” instead of Americans, and taught the opposite of our nation and values;</p>
<p>Thomas Jefferson: “The most effectual means of preventing [the perversion of power into tyranny are] to illuminate, as far as practicable, the minds of the people at large, and more especially to give them knowledge of those facts which history exhibits, that possessed thereby of the experience of other ages and countries, they may be enabled to know ambition under all its shapes, and prompt to exert their natural powers to defeat its purposes.” </p>
<p>Allowed our Christian values and churches to be co-opted; </p>
<p>Patrick Henry: “It cannot be emphasized too strongly or too often that this great nation was founded, not by religionists, but by Christians; not on religions, but on the Gospel of Jesus Christ. For this very reason peoples of other faiths have been afforded asylum, prosperity, and freedom of worship here.”</p>
<p>Allowed those that serve within our governments to not only do what is NOT assigned to the branch they serve within, but what is FORBIDDEN TO THEM TO DO IN EACH/ANY BRANCH of both the state and general governments.</p>
<p>We have not maintained OUR Elections, and it IS our duty to do so at the bottom line.</p>
<p>As the first “branch” of the American government and the fount of all the delegated authority – with the states and the general (federal) being the second and third “branches”, we have not done OUR Constitutional duties as assigned, but let those who serve create their own, give away, trade, etc the duties assigned to the branches, etc.</p>
<p>Thomas Jefferson:“I know no safe depository of the ultimate powers of the society but the people themselves, And if we think them not enlightened enough to exercise their control with a wholesome discretion, the remedy is not to take it from them, but to inform their discretion by education. This is the true corrective of abuses of constitutional power.” </p>
<p>George Washington: “The preservation of the sacred fire of liberty, and the destiny of the Republican model of government, are justly considered as deeply, perhaps as finally staked, on the experiment entrusted to the hands of the American people.”  </p>
<p>James Madison, Federalist 46: “… the ultimate authority … resides in the people alone” </p>
<p>Thomas Jefferson: “The issue today is the same as it has been throughout all history, whether man shall be allowed to govern himself or be ruled by a small elite.”</p>
<p>Alexander Hamilton: “Until the people have, by some solemn and authoritative act, annulled or changed the established form, it is binding upon themselves collectively, as well as individually; and no presumption, or even knowledge, of their sentiments, can warrant their representatives in a departure from it, prior to such an act.”</p>
<p>Thomas Jefferson to Wilson Nicholas: “Our peculiar security is in the possession of a written Constitution. Let us not make it a blank paper by construction.” </p>
<p>James Madison: “Do not separate text from historical background. If you do, you will have perverted and subverted the Constitution, which can only end in a distorted, bastardized form of illegitimate government.”</p>
<p>Thomas Jefferson: “Laws are made for men of ordinary understanding and should, therefore, be construed by the ordinary rules of common sense. Their meaning is not to be sought for in metaphysical subtleties which may make anything mean everything or nothing at pleasure.”</p>
<p>Technocracy is but another evil being used to create the “One World Government”, and destroying our nation from within by “experts”, and computers. </p>
<p>But what it all boils down to, is this;</p>
<p>NO ONE who serves within any branch of the governments are given the power to give away, lend, trade, sell, etc the authority assigned to the branch they serve within.  Not to a person temporarily serving as a president, not to a judge – state or general, not to a foreign entity such as the UN, etc. Not to an, or a group of, “experts”.  </p>
<p>It is all the same thing, TREASON.  OUR government is defined by, and in reality is, the US Constitution and each state Constitution, and the American people.</p>
<p>Alexander Hamilton: “Every act of a delegated authority, contrary to the tenor of the commission under which it is exercised, is void. No legislative act, therefore, contrary to the Constitution, can be valid. To deny this, would be to affirm, that the deputy is greater than his principal; that the servant is above his master; that the representatives of the people are superior to the people themselves; that men acting by virtue of powers, may do not only what their powers do not authorize, but what they forbid.”</p>
<p>That is why all this stuff has happened, because if the people use their LAWFUL and LEGITIMATE authority as the Militia, as the Grand Jury, as the “fount” and last word on the meaning of our government (and this does NOT include those shipped into our nation and KEPT deliberately separate and unAmerican in history, values, language until they are actually assimilated within the polyglot that IS America – since Vietnam, maybe before) then all of the above is “null and void” as is made clear by OUR legitimate government.  </p>
<p>It IS our duty to make the charges of Treason, and other criminal and civil crimes, to charge and arrest, holding the domestic enemies and traitors for trial whatever position they are found in by the organized Militia of the several states which can constitutionally and LAWFULLY combine to stop any threat to this Nation, the US Constitution, the American people.  </p>
<p>No one else has that LAWFUL authority.</p>
<p>It is important to realize that the framers were aware of the natural fear of having a standing army from the historical abuse they are always used for. They were also aware of the political concerns of the states regarding their own defense, should it be necessary, from not only outside invasions, but from those who were corrupt within the general government and might abuse the use of a standing military against them (Jade Helm as there is NOTHING lawful to use the Military outside of the bases, etc provided for them here in America.  They all agreed on one principle: when the states’ militias were needed to defend the country, the US President, and not the governors, would be in charge so that there would be no divisiveness with command. </p>
<p>The way they phrased the wording of assigned President’s power changed many times before they decided on the correct wording, but the exclusivity of that power was never questioned. The most significant change came from Roger Sherman, who added the words</p>
<p>“and of the Militia of the several States, when called into the actual service of the US.”</p>
<p>This assured that the President could NOT take the militia away from the defense of the states EXCEPT when properly called forth by CONGRESS under Article I, Section 8, Clause 15.  It is also the CONGRESS who can call forth the US Military, NOT the President.</p>
<p>But it is also important to realize that the Militia is the People’s tool, not the tool of the general or state governments; though they are required to use it in the circumstances laid out within the US Constitution and within each state’s Constitution and allowed nothing else.</p>
<p>John Adams, A Defense of the Constitutions of the United States 475: “To suppose arms in the hands of citizens, to be used at individual discretion, except in private self-defense, or by partial orders of towns, countries or districts of a state, is to demolish every constitution, and lay the laws prostrate, so that liberty can be enjoyed by no man; it is a dissolution of the government. The fundamental law of the militia is, that it be created, directed and commanded by the laws, and ever for the support of the laws.”<br/>
Alexander Hamilton, The Federalist Papers 28: The militia is a voluntary force not associated or under the control of the States except when called out; [when called into actual service] a permanent or long standing force would be entirely different in make-up and call.”</p>
<p>George Washington: “A free people ought not only to be armed, but disciplined; to which end a uniform and well-digested plan is requisite; and their safety and interest require that they should promote such manufactories as tend to render them independent of others for essential, particularly military, supplies.”  </p>
<p>WE, the People of the United States, are to use OUR tools to remove the corrupt people who are SERVING within our governments LAWFULLY, and REPLACE them with those the people themselves feel can provide an American constitutional government as the contract that those serve under MUST follow.  We may have to put an interim (Making clear it IS TEMPORARY) government in place to keep our nation secure from attacks domestic grabs of power – military or otherwise; or foreign attacks until votes can be held, NO PARTIES involved.</p>
<p>No attorneys, judges, MILITARY, or LE etc can be the interim, TEMPORARY government UNLESS they have been actually using the Supreme LAW of our land in the legal system, etc.  </p>
<p>If they did not believe in it enough to use it, then they are not the type of people we need as an interim government, how can they be trusted? Maybe those that were jailed for keeping their Oaths? Ron Paul knows the government, but is he healthy enough to be interim?  If not, who?  That is our biggest problem, who can be trusted to manage our nation for say 4 – 6 months? This is where we need a George Washington who can put aside the enticements of power.</p>
<p>Today, we may not have one.  If not, our country is lost.</p>

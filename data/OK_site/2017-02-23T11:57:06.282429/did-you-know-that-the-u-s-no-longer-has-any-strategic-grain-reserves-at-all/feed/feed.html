<content:encoded>I, in the midst of research on black elderberries came across black raspberries, that are also Juglone Tolerant, SO if you prefer something that doesn’t have seeds that produces Cyanide Glycolisis,  or whatever it was with cyanide in it, that causes upset stomachs, or if enough is ingested, DEATH this is another alternative, with sweeter fruit. 
<p>probably gonna go a little nuts on planting those next year now, along with more mint.</p>
<p>with enough of these sucking up juglone, I might be able to plant some nitrogen fixers in with them like false indigo. and more herbs like mint and rosemary.</p>

<content:encoded>Oh yes I was talking with my father about it, the trees are very valuable for wood currently, and frankly with all the new ones trying to pop up from the nuts, and the roots, they can be a serious nightmare, and they grow like weeds. 
<p>thanks for the tip on the black elderberries! will definitely plant them around some spots, need to free up the back area for more fruit stuff, front is going to flowers for decoration, and a grape vine… only have a sweet gum tree in the front.</p>

<content:encoded>That’s all well and good but things like “SSS managing” Bald Eagles (they decimate open country mule deer and antelope by hitting the fawns) on public land may not go unnoticed and get you a life prison sentence. The eco-terrorists have been hard at work.

<content:encoded>Plant elder berry ‘trees’, they usually only make shrubs in the states, around your black walnuts. There are other plants that will do this, but if you get ahold of black elderberry then you can make a real good flu busting medicine out of it. Anyway, the elder isn’t harmed by Juglone and will actually prevent said poison from spreading past it. If I remember right Serviceberry has a similar effect. That way you can keep your prime edible walnuts, grow more food/medicine, and with judicious pruning plant some sun lovers back there too. Keep in mind for any of those black walnuts you do fell, that is quite valuable wood you’ll have on your hands.

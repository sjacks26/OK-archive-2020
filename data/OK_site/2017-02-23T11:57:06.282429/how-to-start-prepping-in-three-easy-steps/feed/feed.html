<content:encoded>Excellent article!  I have been ‘prepping’ for years, even before the word was in use.  My family has a 6×8 closet that is dedicated to non-perishable/long-shelf life medical and personal hygiene items.  Baiscally, it is a small scale Walgreens.  We started it by picking up an extra one or two of certain items when we would go to the store.  It took a while, but we now have a 1+ year supply of said items (such as aspirin, feminine hygiene items, toilet paper, antibacterial ointment, bandages, rubbing alcohol, first aid items, iodine, sunscreen, water purification, tooth paste, soap, etc…..  you get my drift).<br/>
  Now, whenever we run out of something we stock, we remove it from storage and make a note to replace it when we next make a supply run.  Then, we put the newly purchased item at the back of the shelf, bringing the older items to the front.<br/>
  It really gives us a good feeling to know that if the supply chain gets interrupted, we have a 1+ year supply of needed items.

<content:encoded>Thank you for this information. I tend to get overwhelmed by some prepping sites.  Your information is “doable”for a beginner like me.

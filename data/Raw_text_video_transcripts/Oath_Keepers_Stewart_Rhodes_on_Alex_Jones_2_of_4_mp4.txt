## Stewart Rhodes; Alex Jones

Stewart Rhodes: [00:00:00] And that's why they have to demonize people that's why you saw H.R. 1955 was a bipartisan assault on the American people. First thing you do is you label someone the enemy. You make them the other, you dehumanize them and then you turn the force against them. And so what we're fighting back and I think your short, your show is important in that. 

Alex Jones: [00:00:20] You know what I think woke the military and police of the biggest? and we've confirmed this with state police and military everywhere and it's even been in the news, but we knew about it before it was you know I mean the point of it was in the news. they're telling them that the mainline Americans are about to start bombing police stations. We gotta do IED training. The army's going to be on the streets of America. There will be a New World Order. But it's good and those that are against it are bad that. they're seeing the whole apparatus that was supposedly to fight al Qaeda has now been swung around like a cannon and aimed at the American people and their police and military are going whoa. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:00:52] That's right. In fact we just we just put up on our site an article on on how enemy combatant status was first proposed during the Clinton administration. Most folks don't realize that. But that idea of using tribunals for even American citizens was first proposed during the Clinton years to be used against McVeigh and the militias. And what Clinton didn't do Bush unfortunately put into put into full effect and now Obama's got it and it's very likely he'll turn it around and apply it domestically you know to the average joe average gun owners. That's the big that's we think might be the next spark. 

Alex Jones: [00:01:26] You know going back to the Mordor analogy, it's just too good. Remember when the keeper of the fortress goes insane and says no we're all dead, starts pouring oil on himself saying we can't beat him there's nothing we can do and sets himself on fire. That's the that's the spirit. More than just waking up police and military. It's, the change is an inside job. It's all of us have to decide. Victory is ours. And when it's not just it's not just a spirit or an idea, it's the truth. We have incredible power but we have to prepare ourselves, steel ourselves. As you said like steel to understand this work and just commit and when you commit and aren't worried if they demonize you set you up kill you. Whatever they're gonna do you just commit. it's like a million pound weight goes off of you and you're truly alive and you're now in communion with the founding fathers and every other rebel against tyranny in history. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:02:17] That's right. We're all going to die anyway. No one gets out of here alive. So what counts is whether you leave your children free. That's all that matters. 

Alex Jones: [00:02:24] That's all that matters. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:02:25] That's really it and getting back to your analogy there. They want you to think it's hopeless. You know yeah it's like if you're like you're staring into the you know into that and you're seeing only their propaganda. if you if all you do is is look at what they want you to see. You'll think it's hopeless. 

Alex Jones: [00:02:41] He's Staring into the crystal and it's only what it's a TV set. It's only what Mordor wants them to see. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:02:47] That's exactly right. It's like Claire Wolfe said break your TV you know break that break that stuff and get on the web and communicate with your fellow man. And here's the thing about Oath Keepers it's positive. That's what people respond to so much. It's positive, it's not just more negativity. They're starting to see the other side. And look you know like you said we have we have the strength and we have the power and you can't just assume that the military is your enemy. You can't just assume police are your enemy. They want you to think. 

Alex Jones: [00:03:14] No I I I. I have fallen into that. I mean over the years, I've also got to start to reach out to them [jump in video] the outra-. I was really wondering about five years ago. Why does the media show the worst police brutality over and over again. Why do they focus on it so much. and then I realized they want to split us apart. Which puts the police more in their gang mentality and the people more in their mentality. And that's why they're advertising it and I'm actually helping them when I point, when I make a big deal out of it. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:03:40] Well you know you got to have a truth like Patrick Henry said you got to see the truth and you know know what exactly. 

Alex Jones: [00:03:45] We put the truth out. But but what we have to also and understand there are encouraging officers to act like this and understand they're not all like this and that we fall in to just hating them and being threatened by them. That's what they want. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:03:57] That's right. And that's one of the value in having in a man like you just had on, where he tells you that look not all officers are like this. And you'd be surprised. We have a testimonial up on our site by a police officer. I'm going to find it here while we're talking and I'll read it to you. But he just basically says look the majority of the guys in my force agree we won't do these things. And so I'm getting I'm hearing that from Marines too. I got a Marine sergeant the other day I talked to on the phone, like I talked to my guys about this stuff all the time and I make sure they know their oath. a lot of the young guys may first get to his unit. They think that their oath is to the president and he have to set him straight you know. But now more and more the talking about this stuff and that was going on you know before we we founded Oath keepers that was going on already. So we're just kind of tapping into what's already happening. Look at that right now. Here we go. This officer says he's a Texas police officer after serving in the Navy from 1990 to 1993 on board the USS Blue Ridge. I became a police officer. I'm still on the force. Not only will I refuse any unlawful order abolish the Constitution I will fight the tyrants that give the orders. Rest assured that me and my brothers in law enforcement talk about this subject on a regular basis. about 80 percent feel the same way I do. I asked the rookies when it comes down to nut cutting. Whose side will you be on. The founding fathers who made this country so great or the tyrants that are in power now. I took the oath twice and will uphold it. Two fold. God bless America. And he signed his name Colin Connerly. Some people are willing to put their names on it. The Others folks understandably are not. But that's that's that's the sentiment we're getting. We're getting flooded with e-mails like that saying yeah we're we're we're we're with you you know. 

Alex Jones: [00:05:35] Well I would add to this that you know getting into the spiritual angle of the standing up for liberty and goodness you know as Martin Luther King said the universe bends towards truth, towards justice, that it's providence. And if you don't understand that folks, when you decide to fight evil and really get your head straight and you really are fighting evil, not being manipulated into fighting some red herring the establishment gives you, they're very good at that. It's like a electrical connection. It's spiritual. And in that way when I said that earlier you literally then connect in to the founding fathers and everybody else stood up for goodness. You know you can you literally connect him to the disciples who were fighting the corruption of Rome. You literally it's it's like a barrier a dam is removed. When you start standing up for freedom because that's all that matters in the world. That's always a struggle between good and evil, there's always evil trying to take over, there's always evil trying to dominate. This is what life is all about is you know defending liberty and freedom and building things and making life better. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:06:35] That's right. And you first you got to do is you've got to not let fear control you. You got to say you look at the big picture and realize that that's what that's the value of the oath, is that everyone has taken that oath in the military. You know they did so understanding that could mean their life. And these men they take it so seriously still. I've gotten letters, I can't even read them, I'll start bawling, but letters from Vietnam veterans and Korean War veterans and they still take that oath serious to this day. and they understand that they have a mind line going all the way back to to you know the morning men of April 19 1775. Even before that you know. they understand that the line of men who have fought and bled and died for freedom. and they understand it that all those men gave them the sacred trust and now it's in, their watch. That's why our motto is it's not on our watch. because now it's our turn to make sure that the light of liberty does not go out. because if America falls the world will fall into an age of darkness. And that's the truth and these guys they know it they're waking up. 

Alex Jones: [00:07:45] Well Look at North Korea look at China look at Mexico they're all falling into total corruption and mass murder and open sewage running down the streets. That's what evil does it does it just. in very few nations in history, we haven't been perfect here in the U.S. but compared to others it's been amazing. Four percent of the world's population half the world's wealth until the bankers took over. Now they're taking it from us. And that was produced here. And again that's what a little bit of liberty. we haven't been perfect but it's a lot compared to other countries. You see the jewel of liberty as Thomas Jefferson said must be guarded. It is the engine of everything good. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:08:21] That's it. That's it. Freedom is all that matters. And as as Franklin said those who would give up freedom for perceived security will have neither. And so you can't give up freedom. if it's the fundamental what you just said is it's the engine of all it's good. And so that that the secret is not let fear control you. And since 9/11 people been so afraid they've allowed all the infrastructure of totalitarian state to be put into place. And as you know. And so now now that we have to do to stop it. you don't stop it in the courts and apparently you don't stop in Congress see that they'll go and do what they want anyway. What you do is you stop it at the base level of the people saying no. 

Alex Jones: [00:09:00] Here's an example. I was on ninety three point seven FM for an hour yesterday downtown during South by southwest and I want my three police. And they were all fans of the show and wanted to shake my hand. So you know that's an example. even after all of mine you know was ranting and raving. Yeah they told me hey we don't like what's happening either and we don't like how the media just totally focuses on the bad cops. And so I can see I was I've also been fooled by that spell. you know as I get older I learn more and more how sophisticated mind control system works. All of us you know are waking up together and I think really I mean when I say I feel a quickening I see a quickening. It's like I just you know jumped on a 300 foot cliff into cold icy water. I mean it's invigorating it's blazing bracing it's like whoa. And then I realized that myself and others are at the very center of a crossroads That is the future destiny of humanity. That's right. When people look back on this time it's going to dwarf the importance of 1776 I believe. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:10:02] It might well might well and that that's the key is to break the spell. You know they've been under a spell. We've been under a spell and it's time to break it. Absolutely. And so what what we did is we issued a declaration of ten orders we will not obey. And that's what's kind of causing that kind of a lot of controversy and firestorm. And when I go around the web and look at different forums discussing it it's. what's happening is exactly what we want. We wanted to happen we want we want it. Veterans and current serving military to have discussions about where their line is. Each person has their own. I mean every serve every service member has an obligation not just at this point that they can refuse in a legal order or an unlawful order. They have an obligation to. They have to. And so they have to make a decision for themselves where that line is. And so as often the officer said a minute ago you have to do it ahead of time. so that's our declaration of ten orders

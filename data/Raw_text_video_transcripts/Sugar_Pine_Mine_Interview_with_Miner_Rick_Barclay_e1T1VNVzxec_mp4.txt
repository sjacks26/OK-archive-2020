Rick Barclay: [00:00:02] I can't work I'm. The BLM. I have a stop work order. I'm not allowed to do anything. I'm supposed to remove my possessions from this mine. Close up this mine, reclaim the surface and leave before I even get a hearing. 

Rick Barclay: [00:00:25] The original track was probably put down in the very very early 1900s. And then we've had to repair it. We have to rebuild it all. That's part of the reason a lot of our efforts have been spent on Development work. Because the ties had rotted out. And now. We had to Basically relay the track, resecure the track. Had to retimber, clean out the slides. We've done lots of work that hasn't been productive, productive in the sense of producing ore. But it's absolutely necessary for the. Workings of the mine. 

Rick Barclay: [00:01:03] Now That by God is genuine galice leaverite. Leaverite is a miner's term for you should leave it right where you found it. 

Off-camera: [00:01:16] How long have you been mining 

Rick Barclay: [00:01:18] Total. 

Off-camera: [00:01:19] Sure. 

Rick Barclay: [00:01:20] Since mid 70s. 

Off-camera: [00:01:22] How long have you been on the claim here 

Rick Barclay: [00:01:25] I bought my share last year. I was here the year before helping them to do development and open the mine up because there was a lot of. Lot of work had to be done before the money started to come out of the hill. This is the original. Listing from the galice mining district book, That existed. These are the official records prior to the formation of Josephine County. This book is in the vault at the Josephine County Recorder's Office. This is original location notice. This is what we date our claim to this mine from this original location notice. This mine has been held by a miner in continuous possession since this. Therefore We're Questioning how the BLM has surface management authority on a mine that they have never actually had possession of. 

Rick Barclay: [00:02:19] The 1872 Mining Act granted exclusive possession and enjoyment. That's the wording of the law, to the miner. It was as Property. The miner controlled the surface was the miners, the mineral was the miners. The surface resource Act was passed To address problems with the misuse of the 72 act. People were claiming land, building vacation cabins. Cutting timber, grazing, so there was a valid reason for adjusting it. The claims that were filed prior to July 23rd 1955 were granted Grandfather status. they still maintained their surface right. Anything filed after that date, The miner had possession of the mineral he did not have possession of the surface. 

Off-camera: [00:03:16] The confusion appears to be on BLM. because they're trying to put you under the administration of 1955 but in reality you are administered by the 1872 act. 

Rick Barclay: [00:03:29] That's correct. They're claiming surface authority that they can't prove that they have. there was a process for the BLM to acquire surface to pre 55 claims. But it was a process that required either a direct relinquishment from the miner, Form 5. Or An act Within the agency that resulted in a judgment that severed the surface. But you did have a process that you had to go through in order for them to do that. and all these were supposed to be recorded proper serving of service of the papers that they had to maintain the records of. There was a whole series of events that had to go forth before the BLM could sever to the surface. The bill and is now claiming that they have the surface of this mine. And yet they can produce after repeated requests, pleas, and treaties, and a legal notice to produce any form of documentation that shows they have the surface right. Their response to me was the master title plat map says we have surface so we have surface. Now the problem with that is the master title plat map also does not show the sugar pine mine which has been here for 140 years. It hasn't moved an inch. 

Off-camera: [00:04:48] So it appears the BLM may be relying on outdated. 

Rick Barclay: [00:04:55] Inaccurate information. And. 

Off-camera: [00:04:58] What does surface mean. When you say surface price versus everything what does that allow. 

Rick Barclay: [00:05:03] To the BLM if they maintain service right any surface disturbance has to be approved by them. you have to file a plan of operation and put up a bond and they can say yes or no because they have endangered species, Clean water act, all these other constraints. When we talk of the surface under the 1872 act it is like private property. This is not under the management authority of the BLM. they like to say that it is that there's multiple court cases that affirms it's not. 

Off-camera: [00:05:33] So BLM. If I understand correctly you've tried to clear this up. You've made a FOIA request to them. 

Rick Barclay: [00:05:40] I've put in 14 individual FOIA requests. 

Off-camera: [00:05:44] How how long back have those FOIAs been. 

Rick Barclay: [00:05:46] February February 11th. 

Off-camera: [00:05:48] How many responses have you gotten? 

Rick Barclay: [00:05:49] two. I received two in the mail today. Today is April 17th. 

Off-camera: [00:05:56] And you put these back. So you've been trying to get them to show and document how they feel they have surfaced right. 

Rick Barclay: [00:06:03] That's correct. I've asked them to show me in writing where they derive their service management authority and thus far the only thing I've gotten from the BLM aside from Stonewalled, stalled, and ignored was two notices of non-compliance claiming that I'm in violation. 

Off-camera: [00:06:19] And that law that noncompliance is based not on 1872 law is based on a 1955 regulation. 

Rick Barclay: [00:06:27] That's correct. 

Off-camera 2: [00:06:28] Has the BLM done any damage to you already in operating this mine. 

Rick Barclay: [00:06:32] Yeah I can't work. I can't work. I'm. The BLM. I have a stop work order. I'm not allowed to do anything. I'm supposed to remove my possessions from this mine. Close up this mine. reclaim the surface. and leave before I even get a hearing. And The BLM Is trying to bully me and force me off my land At The Risk Of Totally violating my fourth and fifth amendment rights and I refuse to budge I am not leaving. They are not taking me out of here until I get my day in court. This is a constitutional republic. We're a nation of laws and that includes the federal agencies. 

Off-camera: [00:07:16] So. How did this come to be. How did you get the Oath Keepers in how. here. how did that happen. 

Rick Barclay: [00:07:24] BLM officer of the law enforcement officer who I do not know his name and. Contract dept. Stanton came in. On Monday last week. I don't remember the date. They came in. Obstinately to serve George papers which we've already been served so. They came in as far as I'm concerned to see if we had moved out so they could start burning stuff. Let's just call it what it is and. 

Off-camera: [00:07:53] When you say burning stuff what do you mean burning stuff. 

Rick Barclay: [00:07:55] They burn cabin's they burn hundreds hundreds of cabins in this country since the 70s. 

Off-camera: [00:08:01] So within the Siskiyou Mountain range here BLM has a history of burning camps. 

Rick Barclay: [00:08:07] Repeatedly and they burned when they burned one on the set of claims in the eighties on the golden cycle over there. 

Off-camera: [00:08:17] Oh so they burned cabins close by. 

Rick Barclay: [00:08:17] On my group of claims yes. 

Off-camera: [00:08:19] Oh so they have a history of coming and burning cabins with no notice. 

Rick Barclay: [00:08:24] Yes. So. 

Off-camera: [00:08:26] So so as you said. What was your concern about their notice of showing up here. 

Rick Barclay: [00:08:32] When the officers went to leave. The first thing they did is they came up to Danny who was a caretaker and said oh this is the guy we're having a problem with. And then when they were getting ready to leave George said look we're a law abiding constitutional people and deputy Stanton turn to him and says well I have a problem with the Constitution. And at that moment I realized that the Agencies that I rely on to protect my rights Weren't going to protect my rights. So I went to the oath keepers because that's what they say they'll do. 

Off-camera: [00:09:06] So. With that. What happened with bringing the Oath Keepers in here 

Rick Barclay: [00:09:13] The the government has become a little more amenable to my request they have actually sent me two FOIAs. Now that is the sum total of their purpose to be here is to protect my rights to due process and preserve preserve my property until such time as I get my day in court. 

Off-camera: [00:09:30] So currently this is not a standoff. 

Rick Barclay: [00:09:33] No this is not a standoff. This is simply a Protective measure to prevent the BLM from further Violating my rights and destroying my property without due process. 

Off-camera: [00:09:45] So you would describe this as a security operation to protect your constitutional rights. 

Rick Barclay: [00:09:50] That's correct. 

Off-camera: [00:09:51] We've not and there has not been any confrontation with BLM. 

Rick Barclay: [00:09:54] No there has been no confrontation, there has been no implied threat overt threats. Or any such thing. All correspondence with the BLM has been held Through my Attorney. George and I have no contact with the BLM. We'll let the attorney. Deal with him. 

Off-camera: [00:10:13] Do you believe the reason BLM did not come in was because of the Oath Keepers present and the three percent are present. 

Rick Barclay: [00:10:19] I'm absolutely positive the BLM hasn't destroyed my property because it has been protected as have been my rights by a group of folks. 

Off-camera: [00:10:28] Have you had any concerns about the way they've been running the operation the security operation. 

Rick Barclay: [00:10:33] No sir. 

Off-camera: [00:10:34] You have any concerns that. They need to leave or you want them here. 

Rick Barclay: [00:10:39] They came at my request. I requested their presence. I still request their presence. Until such time as I achieve my due process. They can stay here and see to it that justice is served.

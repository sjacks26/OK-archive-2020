<p>Last week, former NSA intelligence analyst John Schindler <a href="https://twitter.com/20committee/status/601131464202260480" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'https://twitter.com/20committee/status/601131464202260480', 'posted a rather disturbing tweet');" target="_blank">posted a rather disturbing tweet</a>. With a statement that one could only assume to be a reference towards Russia, Schindler wrote “Said a senior NATO (non-US) GOFO to me today: ‘We’ll probably be at war this summer. If we’re lucky it won’t be nuclear.’ Let that sink in.”</p>
<p>So who is John Schindler? As a ten-year veteran of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Shadow-Factory-Eavesdropping-America/dp/0307279391?tag=permacultucom-20&amp;linkCode=w13&amp;linkID=&amp;ref_=assoc_res_sw_cr_dka_cra_t0_result_1&amp;ref-refURL=http%3A%2F%2Factivistpost.net%2Fbanners%2Famazon.htm" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.amazon.com/The-Shadow-Factory-Eavesdropping-America/dp/0307279391?tag=permacultucom-20&amp;linkCode=w13&amp;linkID=&amp;ref_=assoc_res_sw_cr_dka_cra_t0_result_1&amp;ref-refURL=http%3A%2F%2Factivistpost.net%2Fbanners%2Famazon.htm', 'the NSA');" target="_blank">the NSA</a>; he was in the news a bit more when <a href="http://www.amazon.com/No-Place-Hide-Snowden-Surveillance/dp/1250062586?tag=permacultucom-20&amp;linkCode=w13&amp;linkID=&amp;ref_=assoc_res_sw_cr_dka_cra_t0_result_3&amp;ref-refURL=http%3A%2F%2Factivistpost.net%2Fbanners%2Famazon.htm" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.amazon.com/No-Place-Hide-Snowden-Surveillance/dp/1250062586?tag=permacultucom-20&amp;linkCode=w13&amp;linkID=&amp;ref_=assoc_res_sw_cr_dka_cra_t0_result_3&amp;ref-refURL=http%3A%2F%2Factivistpost.net%2Fbanners%2Famazon.htm', 'Snowden');" target="_blank">Snowden</a> was making frequent headlines. He used to be a professor at the U.S. Naval War College, and is currently a frequent contributor to Business Insider. According to his <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/author/john-schindler" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.businessinsider.com/author/john-schindler', 'biography');" target="_blank">biography</a> on Business Insider, he used to teach classes on security, strategy, intelligence, and terrorism, and he has “collaborated closely with other government agencies who would probably prefer he didn’t mention them.” It’s safe to say that Schindler probably brushes shoulders with high-ranking officials from time to time, so his tweet should be taken seriously.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a>It’s frightening to think that members of NATO may actually be preparing for, and expecting a war with Russia this summer, but unfortunately it’s not all that surprising. Given some of the activity we’re seeing around the world, it’s safe to assume that superpowers like the US, Russia, and China, are preparing for something big.  <a href="http://www.infowars.com/senior-nato-official-well-probably-be-at-war-this-summer/" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.infowars.com/senior-nato-official-well-probably-be-at-war-this-summer/', 'Infowars also reported on Schindler’s tweet');" target="_blank">Infowars also reported on Schindler’s tweet</a>, and noted some of the provocative moves that have been going on around the world lately.<br/>
Earlier this month NATO launched its <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/russia/11584167/Britain-and-Nato-launch-biggest-war-games-on-Russias-doorstep-as-tensions-grow.html" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/russia/11584167/Britain-and-Nato-launch-biggest-war-games-on-Russias-doorstep-as-tensions-grow.html', 'biggest ever wargame exercise');" target="_blank">biggest ever wargame exercise</a> on Russia’s doorstep. Moscow responded by <a href="http://www.latimes.com/world/europe/la-fg-china-russia-joint-naval-maneuvers-20150511-story.html#page=1" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.latimes.com/world/europe/la-fg-china-russia-joint-naval-maneuvers-20150511-story.html#page=1', 'conducting “provocative” wargames in the Mediterranean Sea');" target="_blank">conducting “provocative” wargames in the Mediterranean Sea</a> in coordination with the Chinese PLA, the first ever naval drill involving both superpowers.</p>
<p>NATO powers are also taking part in <a href="http://rt.com/news/261781-nato-drills-games-arctic/" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://rt.com/news/261781-nato-drills-games-arctic/', 'one of Europe’s largest ever fighter jet drills');" target="_blank">one of Europe’s largest ever fighter jet drills</a> from today, with the United States, the United Kingdom, Switzerland, the Netherlands, Germany, France, Finland, Norway and Sweden all involved in the 12 day exercise.</p>
<p>Tensions are also building between the U.S. and China, with The Global Times, a state media outlet owned by the ruling Communist Party, today warning that “war is inevitable” if Washington doesn’t halt its demands that Beijing stop building artificial islands in the South China Sea.</p>
<p>“If the United States’ bottom line is that China has to halt its activities, then a U.S.-China war is inevitable in the South China Sea,” <a href="https://ph.news.yahoo.com/china-state-paper-warns-war-over-south-china-043429295.html" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'https://ph.news.yahoo.com/china-state-paper-warns-war-over-south-china-043429295.html', 'the newspaper said');" target="_blank">the newspaper said</a>. “The intensity of the conflict will be higher than what people usually think of as ‘friction’.”</p>
<p>Last week, <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2015/05/20/politics/south-china-sea-navy-flight/index.html" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://edition.cnn.com/2015/05/20/politics/south-china-sea-navy-flight/index.html', 'CNN revealed');" target="_blank">CNN revealed</a> how China’s Navy has repeatedly issued warnings to U.S. surveillance planes flying over the South China Sea.<br/>
While these sorts of warnings come and go all the time, that in and of itself is kind of scary. The fact that we now live in a world where high-ranking officials just assume nuclear war is right around the corner, means we should be very concerned. Wars rarely, if ever, happen out of the blue. There are always quiet rumors of wars before the real deal comes to pass.</p>

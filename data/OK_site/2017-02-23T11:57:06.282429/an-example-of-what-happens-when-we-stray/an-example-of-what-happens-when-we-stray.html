<p>This is not a big story. It is but a small incident, relatively benign. But this story from Texas illustrates something we’d like to observe with our readers at Oath Keepers. Here is the shirt in question, followed by the story in the news, followed by our astute observations.</p>

<h1 class="entry-title">Voter wearing pro-gun shirt turned away</h1>
<p>February 21 2014 by <span class="vcard author">by Kevin Reece</span></p>
<p>–</p>
<p>HEMPSTEAD, Texas — <em>Chris Driskill is a staunch supporter of the 2nd  Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.  But this week he found out that his  pro-gun support cannot be proudly proclaimed on his clothing if he  wants to cast a ballot at the Waller County Courthouse or any other  Texas voting location.</em></p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p><em>Driskill, employed as a private security guard in Houston, went to  the Waller County Courthouse in Hempstead on Tuesday to cast his  early-voting ballot in the Republican Primary. He was wearing a black  T-shirt with a logo on the front and back that says “2nd Amendment –  America’s Original Homeland Security.” The words circle a skull and  crossbones where the “bones” are short-barrel pistol grip shotguns.</em></p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p><em>“I heard a gentleman’s voice over my shoulder say ‘he can’t vote with  that shirt on. You’ll have to either turn it inside out our you’ll have  to leave,’” Driskill said of the polling place encounter.</em></p>

<p><strong>Oath Keepers commentary: </strong>As we said, it’s not a big deal, just a small story about a minor nuisance, yes? So why bring it up here?</p>
<p>We bring it up to point out what many of you who went ahead and read that whole article at the above link may have thought of already.</p>
<p>Details in the story reveal that the Texas (quoting) <em>Republican Primary ballot includes a proposition asking for a yes or no  vote on expanded support for the 2nd Amendment and the places where a  concealed weapon can be legally carried.  Under the Texas Election Code  rule the proposition is a “measure” and Driskill’s pro-2nd Amendment  shirt considered “electioneering” or campaigning for his point of view  and is treated the same as those yard signs kept 100 feet from the  voting entrance at the courthouse. (end quote)</em></p>
<p>Why was a bill about the Second Amendment on the ballot anyway?  As strict Contitutionists understand, no law regarding firearms, subsequent to the Second Amendment, can be a “law”. In other words, the Second Amendment is the last law about firearms which should ever be written in this country. It says, plain as day, <em>“…shall not be infringed”</em>. Every law regarding firearms since that Amendment was ratified is an infringement unless it is a law further guaranteeing the Militia’s fully empowered possession of firearms in the hands of  We The People. No law requiring a “permit” of any kind can be a Constitutional law. No law limiting size and length of a barrel on a firearm can be a law. No law restricting how fast a firearm can fire bullets can be a law.  The highest law of the land says so. Period.</p>
<p>Our point is that the Federal government has motive untoward reducing the role of the Constitutional Militia of the several States, and therefore has failed the People by allowing their respective States to pass so-called “laws” bearing all sorts of restrictions on our right to keep and bear arms. As are many Americans right now, Texans may be waking up and realizing that their Second Amendment rights have been jeopardized by “unfair” “laws”, and Texas Republicans are striving to reduce the violations against Texas citizens by placing a pro-gun measure on the Texas primary ballot. When Texas citizens truly awaken to the loss of our Union, they will realize that all the “gun laws” on their books (excepting any which further ensure Second Amendment rights) are null and void anyway and need not be acknowledged by the citizens or their police.</p>
<p>But most Americans, and most Texans as well, are not quite that far along in their personal awakening process at present time, so they will meekly bow to Caesar and change shirts before voting, and will meekly bow to Caesar while begging for permission to carry concealed, or whatever else they feel they should be “permitted” to do with their firearms.  That is the not-so-subtle truth this benign little article carries for Oath Keepers.</p>
<p>How think Ye?</p>

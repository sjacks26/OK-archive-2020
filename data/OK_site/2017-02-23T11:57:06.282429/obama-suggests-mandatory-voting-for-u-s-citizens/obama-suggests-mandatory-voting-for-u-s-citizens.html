<p><strong>The fascinating thing about this little propaganda drive on the part of the Obama Administration is that he claims such measures are necessary in order to combat the influence of “big money” in politics.  I think a better way to combat big money would be for Obama to remove all the banking elites within his OWN CABINET.  It might be a good start, anyway.  Beyond Obama’s seeming hypocrisy is the problem of collectivism, which is what is actually being promoted here.  The idea that individuals owe allegiance and participation in the state.  Because of the false left/right paradigm, the only real choice Americans have left in politics is to abstain from participation entirely, at least at the national level (local elections offer some opportunities for change) .  Now, the elites want to take away that option from you as well.  You aren’t allowed to abstain.  You aren’t allowed to protest (except in designated zones).  And, you certainly aren’t allowed to revolt.  Eventually, I predict Americans won’t even be allowed to leave the country.  This is what happens when the people become property of the state…</strong></p>

<p>They say the only two things that are certain in life are death and taxes. President Barack Obama wants to add one more: voting.</p>
<p>Obama floated the idea of mandatory voting in the U.S. while speaking to a civic group in Cleveland on Wednesday. Asked about the influence of money in U.S. elections, Obama digressed into the topic of voting rights and said the U.S. should be making it easier for people to vote.</p>
<p>Just ask Australia, where citizens have no choice but to vote, the president said.</p>
<p>“If everybody voted, then it would completely change the political map in this country,” Obama said, calling it “potentially transformative.” Not only that, Obama said, but universal voting would “counteract money more than anything.”</p>
<p>Disproportionately, Americans who skip the polls on Election Day are younger, lower-income and more likely to be immigrants or minorities, Obama said. “There’s a reason why some folks try to keep them away from the polls,” he said in a veiled reference to voter identification laws in a number of states.</p>
<p>Less than 37 percent of eligible voters cast ballots in the 2014 midterms, according to the United States Election Project. And a Pew Research Center study found that those avoiding the polls in 2014 tended to be younger, poorer, less educated and more racially diverse.</p>
<p>At least two dozen countries have some form of compulsory voting, including Belgium, Brazil and Argentina. In many systems, absconders must provide a valid excuse or face a fine, although a few countries have laws on the books that allow for potential imprisonment.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><strong>By Brandon Smith, Associate Editor</strong></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">The Ebola issue has certainly brought the concerns of the average prepper/survivalist to the forefront of American social discussion, and has reminded many of us that time is the most precious of commodities.  When I think about how many people I have met in my years as an activist who refused to take any concrete precautions whatsoever, even after receiving adequate warning, I shudder.</p>
<p>The Eureka CPT is still in its infancy, with only a few months of organization and training, and such a quick turning of events certainly adds stress to our efforts to mobilize effectively while there is room to maneuver.  The response of individual members, though, has so far been superb.</p>
<p>I am reminded after each training event why it is absolutely vital to have a mixture of skill sets, and why a community of prepared citizens is far more effective than a lone survivalist or lone family.  Our medically trained staff have risen to the occasion of late, and have composed Ebola response procedures for the team, which they will be presenting this week.  The CPT will then present these findings to the general community in a public seminar designed to educate people as much as possible in measures they can take without the forced “aid” of federal institutions such as FEMA and the CDC.  In turn, we will also be sharing our response guidelines with the Liberty Movement in general.  I can only imagine how different things would be if we had a CPT in every city and county in the country.</p>
<p>The recent announcement by the Obama Administration that the Department of Defense will soon be activating Ebola “strike teams” to be used domestically leads me to believe that the first spark of a program to introduce medical martial law is at hand.  Given the fact that it has been the government’s lack of rational prevention measures that has caused the crisis so far, I think the feds have lost any credibility whatsoever.  That is to say, local communities and individuals should not tolerate forced medical martial law by a government that created the problem in the first place.</p>
<p>The answer, in my view, is once again the Oath Keepers Community Preparedness Teams.  Localized response by knowledgeable citizens within their own towns, counties and states.  Frankly, the government has proven it will only get in the way, and make matters worse.</p>
<p>Outside of our organization for Ebola response, regular training continues.  Our latest live fire session went very well, with rifle handling improving in all age groups.  Our members who are recent combat veterans from Iraq have added a vital sense of how to realistically handle contact.  The primary goal – train until rifle handling is ingrained in your muscle memory.  Even when adrenaline is flooding the brain, muscle memory prevails.</p>
<p>Many new members are beginning to attend through word of mouth and invitation, and it is exciting to see so many people with a sincere interest in making a difference in their community and the world at large.  Self motivated individuals truly are the most effective people, and I have seen no shortage of them in CPT training.</p>
<p>Our next order of business will probably be tactical group movement with the use of communications, as well as home and ranch defense.  These are broad categories and will take time to master, but they are indispensable to anyone hoping to survive a national crisis situation.</p>
<p>With winter approaching, I highly recommend that those interested in forming a CPT in their area join Oath Keepers and contact the chapter president for their state in the near term.  I would say that, at minimum 4-5 months are necessary to build a coherent and effective team, though some may be able to work faster given existing skill sets and the right set of circumstances.  I expect that the viral pandemic threat, along with the resurgence in economic volatility, is more than enough reason for people to finally step away from their computers and organize face to face.</p>
<p>This is Brandon Smith, Oath Keepers Associate Editor and member of the Eureka CPT, signing out.</p>

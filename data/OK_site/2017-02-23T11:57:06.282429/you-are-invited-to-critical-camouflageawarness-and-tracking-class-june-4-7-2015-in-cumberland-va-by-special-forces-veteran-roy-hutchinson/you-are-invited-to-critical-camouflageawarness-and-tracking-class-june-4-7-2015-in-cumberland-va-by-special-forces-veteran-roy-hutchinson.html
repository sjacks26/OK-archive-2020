<p>Oath Keepers Founder, Stewart Rhodes, will be attending this class and welcomes you to join him there. Actually, there are two classes.</p>
<p>1. A one day class on camouflage and awareness (the most critical skill) on June 4, 2015. Price for Oath Keepers is $50.00 per person.</p>
<p>2. A three day tracking class on June 5-7, 2015. Price for Oath Keepers is $100.00 per person. That is dirt cheap! Roy is making the class so cheap so more Oath Keepers can afford to attend. Both will be taught at a primitive campsite in Cumberland, VA. So, bring your camping gear and food, and be ready to camp out and learn some critical skills.</p>
<p>See the below class descriptions.</p>
<p>To sign up, and for answers to any questions, please email Roy at: <a href="mailto:inahme2004@yahoo.com">inahme2004@yahoo.com</a></p>
<p>You can also sign up at his website: <a href="http://trackingsurvival.com/" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://trackingsurvival.com/', 'http://trackingsurvival.com/');" target="_blank" title="tracking survival">http://trackingsurvival.com/</a></p>
<p>But if you do that, you will have to pay full price and he can refund you the difference at the class. So, better to just email him and he can invoice you that way.</p>
<p>NOTE FROM STEWART: Tracking and awareness are critical skills. So is camouflage. You must be aware of your surroundings and who and what is active near you and in your area. Tracking vastly expands your capability to know where the enemy is (whether that enemy is in war or in “normal” times) and tracking helps you find lost people, lost animals, and game. It is also a critical military skill that is now experiencing a revival, such as in the Marine Corps’ Combat Hunter program. And camouflage is also vital. In combat, if you can be seen, you can be shot. Roy is an excellent teacher, and you will leave his class with a greatly improved capability. I look forward to seeing you there if you can make it. – Stewart Rhodes</p>
<p>PS- Sorry for the late notice on this class. If you cannot make it, please still email Roy so he can put you on an alert list for upcoming classes. We will try to give more notice next time.</p>
<p>Description of the June 4 Camouflage and Awareness class:</p>
<p>The ability to hide from danger or to see the danger that is hiding from you is the #1 survival skill for ALL animals—especially humans!<br/>
We at Wilderness Discovery have spent many years in Search &amp; Rescue and Law Enforcement hunting people, so we’ve learned a thing or two. To make it a painless experience, we have developed a childhood game as our way of teaching you how to hide and, more importantly, how to find the hidden. participants will be given the opportunity to test their skills in the art of camouflage against professional man hunters. That’s right we’re taking hide &amp; seek to the next level.</p>

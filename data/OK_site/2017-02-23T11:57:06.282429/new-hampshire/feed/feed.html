<content:encoded>It is a well known fact that National does not recognize a NH chapter. The problem is the lack of participation on the part of the members to get teams together and to set up a  chain of officers.<br/>
Until that happens, There will be no official NH chapter. Its pretty sad when you cant get members together for a meet and greet. I went to a cookout a few months ago where 9 people RSVP’d and myself and my girlfriend were the only ones who showed up. That’s the second time that has happened. The hosts for the cookout turned out to be very nice people and we enjoyed their company very much. They are very dedicated to the cause of liberty. The POC was schedualed to be there but had a family emergency and was unable to attend. If we don’t get together, Nothin gets done. Its that simple.<br/>
The POC is a very busy guy and is not always available. At least he stood up where nobody else would. My suggestion would be to get on the NH forum and get active. There has not been much activity there for some time. Its really depressing. There are at least two oathkeepers local to me and I have sent invites. NO RESPONSE….<br/>
I think the best bet would be to get regional teams together or perhaps by county. Whatever works. Right now we are spread out all over the state and it makes things difficult.

<p>Testimonial: Crisis</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">By Presidential decree, Barack Obama has attempted to eliminate the cherished liberty of law abiding American gun owners, the honest tax paying public, citizens who have chosen to exercise the rights of personal freedom that are derived from the 2nd Amendment. Thomas Paine penned in The Crisis best when on 23 December 1776; he wrote, “These are the times that try men’s souls” in reference to the conflagration of the American Revolution. Santayana wrote in The Life of Reason, “Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.” In 2013 America, we approach a crisis tantamount to the 13 colonies separation from the British Empire. Our crisis is not an external attack by a foreign enemy, but an insidious internal assault on the United States Constitution by an elected American progressive President. Barack Obama has with the articulate gift of persuasion convinced the uninformed masses that his progressive agenda is what America shall become as a nation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Like King George of England who attempted to tax the colonist “rabble” until they rebelled, our President has divided this nation, not witnessed since the civil war, has forced the tax of universal healthcare on all Americans, increased social security taxes, raised taxes on the successful, declared war on the 2nd amendment, continued to drive the greatest economy in history towards bankruptcy, has illegally sold firearms to drug cartels, has begun to eviscerate our military, failed to defend Israel, capitulated to Iran, lied about Benghazi and many other issues with zero regard for Americas integrity, liberty or values.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The President woefully distorts what Jefferson wrote in the Declaration of Independents with regards to its meaning: “We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.” I question whether our President has ever read the Declaration of Independents further than the above quote? In his partisan isolation he would be wise to heed the following: “That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The President has publicly sworn to protect the Constitution, yet attempts to infringe on the rights of those who chose to keep and bear Arms. He has failed to grasp the importance of the 2nd Amendment to Americans. An Amendment designed to protect Americans from the tyranny of governments both foreign and domestic. Our sagacious Founding Fathers, whose lives were disrupted through years of war, before victory was won, vowed to make the 2nd Amendment only subordinate to our freedom of speech. George Washington himself wrote “Firearms are second only to the Constitution in importance; they are the peoples’ liberty’s teeth”. Thomas Jefferson likewise believed the same when he wrote ” No freeman shall be debarred the use of arms.” Who can forget the immortal words of Patrick Henry as he inspired men to take up arms for the cause of liberty, when he said; “I know not what course others may take; but as for me, give me liberty or give me death!”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Gun owners today, the recipients of constitutional guaranteed freedoms are no  longer called “Rabble” by a contemptuous foreign government, but are now relentlessly disparaged as Tea Baggers, Absolutists, Extremist, and Fringe elements by our elected President, his lieutenants, and the liberal media, as they propagandize against today’s patriots. History from the mid-20th century revels today’s liberal politicians and press tactics come directly from the pages of Mein Kampf. Hitler wrote that the gifted orator speaking in generalities to the uniformed masses could convince them to support his doctrine, and then with deceitful skill, his propaganda machine created true believers out of misled citizens that led to their loss of freedom and the destruction of WWII.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The question for all gun owners, is will we allow history to repeat or will we stand united in the protection of our 2nd Amendment right and fight to repel those who would destroy our cherished heritage? Finally, As an American I will only defend the Constitution of the United States not progressive politicians and I will never be forced to become a criminal in the fight for Freedom!</p>

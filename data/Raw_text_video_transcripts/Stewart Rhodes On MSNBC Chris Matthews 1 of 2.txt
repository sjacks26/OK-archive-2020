## Chris Matthews; Stewart Rhodes

CM: We start with OK who, who are they and what they are and what they say they are all about. SR is founder of OK. Mark Potok is with the SPLC. Stewart, let me run through a couple of things. You say you group will not obey orders to do. Let’s take a look at that list. You will not impose martial law or a state of emergency on any state. You will not invade or subjugate any state, I guess of the Union, that asserts its sovereignty. You will not blockade American cities turning them into giant concentration camps. You will assist or support the use of any foreign troops, you won’t do that or obey orders to do that, on US soil. Do you guys have the current firepower to standup against the federal government, if you people are ordered to do those things.

SR: That’s not the point. It’s not the point of firepower, it’s the obligation all of us have who swore an oath to support and defend the Constitution. We’re calling on active military and police to stand down and refuse to comply with unlawful orders.

CM: All your people in your recruited groups are people who potentially armed, is that right?

SR: If they’re active duty police and military, of course. I mean a cop carries a gun.

CM: That seems to be the group you’re going after, the group you’re recruiting.

SR: Well sure. They’re the ones who will receive unlawful orders. It was a My Lai that the soldiers committed atrocities.

CM: Let’s not confuse the issue with My Lai. You have on your list, you will not obey any order to invade or subjugate any state that asserts its sovereignty. I guess I’m too normal, when I first read that I thought you meant we wouldn’t invade Iraq, which is a sovereign country. But you laugh. This is why people think you’re crazy.

SR: We’re talking about domestic.

CM: You laugh. A sovereign state of the United States. In other words the Civil War would not have been fought if you guys had been around.

SR: That’s not the point. Look at Article 4 Section 4. 

CM: What do you mean it’s not the point. You say you will not invade any state or subjugate any state that asserts its sovereignty. The Confederacy asserted its sovereignty. What would you have done if you’d be in the Union Army then.

SR: If I’d been in the Union Army then? We’re not talking about secession here, we’re talking about the balance of power between the states and the federal government.

CM: No no no. You say any state that asserts either through nullification or secession its sovereignty. What would you do?

SR: We’re not talking about nullification.

CM: If this Texas governor, this guy Rick Perry, he talks about secession. Obviously, he’s talking loony toony. I don’t think he means it but who knows. If he ever did try to secede and you were in the federal government, what would you do?

SR: I think the state has a right to assert its sovereignty. There’s dual sovereignty in our system. It’s not one

CM: Is it ever right to secede?

SR: If the federal government violates the compact and destroys the Constitution, then there is no Constitution.

CM: (0:02:48.5) Give me the circumstances. In other words, I’ve always wondered when I listen to your group, I want to know about operations. I don’t care about your philosophy, a lot of people are libertarian. Ron Paul, I like him in a lot of ways, I agree with him on the Iraq War. I got no problem with the libertarian philosophy. What I don’t like about people who are armed who are being recruited to stand up in some operation. I want to know when you would call your forces together and challenge the U.S. government. When would you do that?

SR: It’s not about calling forces together. It’s simply saying they’re not going to comply with orders to violate the rights of the American people. We’re not talking about asking them to go fight, we’re saying simply don’t fight the people.

CM: What’s this concentration camp thing you’re talking about? What is this thing about bringing foreign troops into the United States? What scenarios do you live in?

SR: Look at the history of the 20th century. We had the internment of Japanese-Americans right here on American soil. We don’t want to see that happen again. Do you?

CM: Do you foresee concentration camps in this country?

SR: It happened once before to Japanese-Americans.

CM: Do you foresee it?

SR: It’s a possibility. Our goal is

CM: Why are you organizing people about the plausibility of concentration camps in this country, of the landing of foreign troops. What foreign troops would be landing in the United States, what are you talking about?

SR: (0:04:04.4) There is a historic pattern, this has happened in the past. We want to make sure it doesn’t happen here.

CM: When? What do you mean by foreign troops in the United States, name them. I guess I’m confused here.

SR: Look at the Hessians in the American Revolution. You had foreign troops then that were used. It happens throughout history, go look at history. 

CM: So you’re putting people together on a war footing, preparing them to be vigilant

SR: It’s not about, it’s not a war

CM: To be ready to challenge the imposition of foreign troops in this country, the creation of concentration camps in this country. Do you know what I think you’re up to? Is creating a mindset. I heard some people talking the other day about the battle, we have to keep the battle going. You want to have people in a militant environment where they think militantly with this sense of perhaps taking steps at some point against the government, not taking orders or in some way rebelling. So you keep people in a mindset of right-wing thinking so you can achieve some immediate political goal. I’m just wondering, getting them to vote right wing? What are you trying to get people to do in the next year or two, or 10 years, before this Armageddon struggle occurs?

SR: We want them to keep their oath, Chris. The oath is to the Constitution. 

CM: No in the short term. You don’t expect concentration camps to come in the short run, do you?

SR: No I don’t. It’s a long-term concern.

CM: Do you expect the Hessians to be back in the short run.

SR: We are trying to prevent this country from suffering the abuse and violation of rights that has happened in other countries in recent history.

CM: How so?

SR: How so? By keeping the oath to the Constitution. It’s not to any one man, whether he gives you a feel up your leg or not. It’s to the Constitution.

CM: So you believe we have a possibility in this country of undermining the Constitution under Barack Obama?

SR: (0:05:50.6) Or under a future President Giuliani or anyone else. The abuse of the Constitution didn’t begin with Obama, and it hasn’t stopped either. Bush was violating the Constitution also.

CM: How many hours a day do you worry about the Constitution being undermined by Barack Obama? In other words, your rights being taken away, concentration camps being formed, foreign troops being landed, the black helicopters stopping at a military base near you. How many hours a day do you think about this probability or even plausibility?

SR: I’m a constitutional lawyer, I’ve been thinking about this for years.

CM: But how many hours a day do you actually worry about this happening? Seriously. Do you go to bed at night. When you put your head on the pillow, are you worried that at some point in your lifetime the black helicopters from the UN will arrive in the United States and deny American sovereignty? Do you think that’s probable or possible? Or probable.

SR: (0:06:38.8) I think it’s possible. We’re concerned about. Look at Germany. An advanced civilization and they fell into despotism and a murderous dictatorship in the span of 10 years after an economic collapse. It can happen here, you think it can’t happen here? Ask the Japanese-Americans if it can happen here.

CM: I’m talking about in the mean time. I think you’re trying to create a state of mind.

SR: You can think what you want, I know what my goals are.

CM: It’s obvious what you’re trying to do. You’re getting people to sign up, you’re getting people who are armed. Why do you only recruit among police and military and people like that?

SR: Because they will be given the orders to abuse your rights. Who else is going to be doing it? If some day, god forbid, a dictator comes to power in America, who’s going to get the order? Wouldn’t you have liked the soldiers in WW2 to have refused the orders to round up the Japanese-Americans.

CM: I guess I’ve always assumed

SR: No?

CM: People knew that ever since Nuremberg

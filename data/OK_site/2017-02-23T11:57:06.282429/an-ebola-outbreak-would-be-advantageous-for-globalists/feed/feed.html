<content:encoded>Why is no one mentioning tuhat ebola is treatable which itself is the best way to undermine the story line and the power of this plot?
<p>1.  Combating Ebola: How To Fight Ebola with Vitamin C &amp; Ascorbic Acid<br/>
<a href="http://exopolitics.blogs.com/ebolagate/2014/09/combating-ebola-how-to-fight-ebola-with-vitamin-c-ascorbic-acid.html" rel="nofollow">http://exopolitics.blogs.com/ebolagate/2014/09/combating-ebola-how-to-fight-ebola-with-vitamin-c-ascorbic-acid.html</a>  Full recovery.</p>
<p>2.  DOCTOR WHO USED HIV DRUG TO TREAT EBOLA SUCCESSFULLY: EBOLA IS A “DESTRUCTIVE STRAIN OF HIV”<br/>
<a href="http://birdflu666.wordpress.com/2014/09/29/doctor-who-used-hiv-drug-to-treat-ebola-successfully-ebola-is-a-destructive-strain-of-hiv/" rel="nofollow">http://birdflu666.wordpress.com/2014/09/29/doctor-who-used-hiv-drug-to-treat-ebola-successfully-ebola-is-a-destructive-strain-of-hiv/</a>  93% recovery rate.</p>
<p>Both knock a hole in the militarization of a treatable disease.  And what are they offering as treatment?  Has anyone asked?</p>
<p>And could Oathkeepers be part of this effort?</p>
<p>How to Stop Jesuit/Nazi Plans for Mass Murder With Ebola Vaccines</p>

<content:encoded><strong>[Editor’s Note: William Carter, I am sure that you mean well, so I am going to allow your comment to post up online here. However, I must add a word to the wise about this kind of comment. In truth, you have provided not one shred of evidence to support your claims. I am not saying that your claims are false or invalid, am not saying that they are true. What I am saying is that when you come in here and make serious statements which could affect peoples’ decision-making on something as serious as a deadly virus, you really do need to substantiate your claims with hard cold evidence. 
<p>An example: You note that geo-engineering has been around since the 1930s. I do not know about that, but I can tell you that geo-engineering was ongoing in the 1960s during the Vietnam war.  If you have a link to substantiate your claim that geo-engineering was in process as early as the 1930s, please include that sort of resource for your readers.  (For those who do not know about geo-engineering, I recommend the documentary film called “What In The World Are They Spraying” for a great intro to the subject:  </p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jf0khstYDLA" rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jf0khstYDLA</a></p>
<p>So my note is to all readers here — do your own homework on the ebola issue, question authority, and most certainly, as William has already said, question anything you get from the mass media and press. William, I am sorry to introduce your comment this way, but in all fairness to Oath Keepers and our readers, as well as to you personally, I feel that my cautionary statement is necessary. Thanks and I hope you understand.</p>
<p>Salute!<br/>

Don’t believe all the buzz and lies from the main stream news media. There is NO patient zero. This supposed ebola outbreak isn’t an outbreak at all. It’s a bio terror attack / bio terrorism / biological warfare. 
<p>The CDC, WHO, and some governments around the world are down playing ebola, making it seem and appear less of a threat than it actually is.</p>
<p>Do your research, people, and STOP believing the lies from the main stream news media. There was a woman at a White House Press Conference reading a report. As she was reading, she didn’t say ebola outbreak, she said ebola attack…”ATTACK.” She was reading her notes / report. Perhaps she let it slip. I saw this on you tube not too long ago. We’re in BIG trouble, folks. </p>
<p>Do you really believe they would tell you the truth of what’s really going on? Why would they? It’d cause mass panic and civil unrest. </p>
<p>Concerning the ebola virus being airborne, which, CDC, WHO, some governments, and, main stream news media would have the sheeple believe that ebola virus is not airborne. However, how do you explain people getting infected, and areas or regions getting infected, who have had absolutely NO contact with the infected people, areas, and regions, and, just how is it that it’s spreading so rapidly all over the world? Airlines, of course, but NOT just that. What happens when an infected person coughs or sneezes? Tiny, microscopic water molecules go into the air, right? What happens when an uninfected person breaths in or inhales the tiny, microscopic water molecules? They become infected. What is this? This is airborne, NOT just airborne by airliners flying from one airport to the other all over the world with the infected. And, storms, of course. Hurricanes, tornadoes, typhoons, dust / sand storms, even the tiniest bit of wind, would blow the ebola virus from an infected area / region into an uninfected area / region. What is this? It’s airborne. Wake up, sheeple!!! These are the real, hard, cold truths and facts of the matter. </p>
<p>And, It’s NEVER going away, Just like the flu, or the common cold, sinus, allergies, influenza, pneumonia…bacteria, virus, illnesses, plague, HIV / AIDS, cancer…they NEVER disappear. The strains change, and adapt to our immune system. And, the majority of viruses and plagues and diseases, most are concocted in science labs by wacked out scientists. </p>
<p>The great culling has begun. It started a long time ago, but it’s getting much worse, now. Research the Georgia Guidestones and read new world commandment number one. Maintain Earth’s population to no more than 500,000,000. That’s five hundred million. There are approximately 7 – 8 billion people in the world today. How else, or by what other means are the powers that be, the global elite, going to try to reduce Earth’s population to such few people? Genocide through and by means of Nuclear, Biological, Chemical, and Radiological warfare. </p>
<p>This supposed ebola outbreak is NO outbreak at all. NONE whatsoever. It’s an ebola attack…a bio terror attack. Do the research. Look at the timing that all of these things are happening…election time, world economies collapsing, uprisings and rebellions / revolutions in various countries…the world is at war, and the entire infrastructure is crumbling, by design. It’s all orchestrated and happening on purpose for population control, and to build a one world system, government, currency, religion, and leader. Christians, you know exactly what I’m talking about. Biblical Prophecy being fulfilled. </p>
<p>Believe on the LORD and SAVIOR, JESUS CHRIST, and repent, and you shall be saved.</p>

<content:encoded>@ harley, “I guess I always figured our military would do the right thing. Crooked politicians all. We are screwed!”
<p>If they (military) were going to do the “right thing” it would have been done long ago, but then they would no longer have a huge power base that they now have.  Why? </p>
<p>Because the US Constitution assigned (Left) that duty to us, “We the people…” as the Militia of the several states.  Those who serve within our governments – federal &amp; state – started getting rid of the Militias in the 1930’s, right around when Joseph Stalin, in 1933, said: ”The United States should get rid of its militias”.</p>
<p>Yet it is the Militias that are the only constitutionally assigned body required to:<br/>
– Enforce the US Constitution and each state’s Constitution,<br/>
– Enforce and keep the “Laws of the Union” (which is constitutional laws ONLY),<br/>
– Protect the country against all enemies both domestic and foreign, and<br/>
– “to suppress Insurrections and repel Invasions”.  </p>
<p>You see, those duties are OURS and no one elses. But we need to get each state Militia up and running, and TRAINED. If the governor of each state will not do their constitutionally assigned duty to train them as required – “… and the Authority of training the Militia according to the discipline prescribed by Congress”</p>
<p>Article I,  Section. 8,  Clause 16: “To provide for organizing, ARMING, and disciplining, the Militia, and for governing such Part of them as may be employed in the Service of the United States, reserving to the States respectively, the Appointment of the Officers, and the Authority of training the Militia according to the discipline prescribed by Congress”. </p>
<p>Clause 15:  “To provide for calling forth the Militia to EXECUTE THE LAWS OF THE UNION, suppress Insurrections and repel invasions.” </p>
<p>Remember the US Constitution and all that is in Pursuance thereof it is the supreme LAW of this nation; while each state Constitution is the highest law of that state EXCEPT where it conflicts with the US Constitution.</p>
<p>It is our duty.</p>

<content:encoded>Of course you are right Shorty, I guess im frustrated to the point that I put to much trust in our military to set this country back on the correct constitutional course. Thanks for setting me straight . I guess  I always figured our   military would do the right thing. Crooked politicians all. We are screwed !

<content:encoded>My question is , where is our oath keeping military ? What has to happen in this country before they step In .  just asking.
<p><strong>[Associate Editor’s note: Harley, it is not the role of the military to “step in”. On the contrary, Oath Keepers are encouraging the military to stand down. A military dictatorship is not how we follow the Constitution and keep our Oaths to it. – Shorty Dawkins]</strong></p>

<content:encoded>This is now appearing to be an orchestrated invasion/war on our own people by this rogue government and some very powerful identities behind the scenes might have more in store for us soon. No government can be so stupid as this one, and the lies are so numerous, it’s almost laughable, but deadly. There are so many end game possibilities that THEY can impose on Americans…all one has to do is look back at most every conspiracy theory since 9/11 ! It’s all coming into focus….

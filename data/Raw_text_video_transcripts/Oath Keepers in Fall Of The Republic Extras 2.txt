SR: We’ve had critics say, of course I’m going to keep my oath. I find it offensive that you suggest a military officer or police officer wouldn’t keep the oath. We say, hey, look at what happened in Katrina. We want to make sure there are no more Katrinas. We’re hearing that a lot of those guys just weren’t prepared for those orders, hadn’t thought about it ahead of time. We had Lt. Cdr. Guy Cunningham, who was the author of the 29 Palms survey done back in 1995, he surveyed the Marines there and asked if they would fire on Americans who resisted an attempt to disarm them. 

GC: The 29 Palms survey ended with a scenario saying that the government has banned all non-sporting firearms, that the American citizens in possession of these firearms have 30 days to turn them over to local authorities. At the end of the period of time, several citizen groups form that resist or refuse the confiscation of these firearms. Marines were asked whether they would fire upon US citizens who resist the confiscation of these firearms. I found this very difficult to swallow. 11% said no opinion. No opinion? Firing on their own fellow Americans? Of the remaining, 26.34% answered that they would fire on their fellow Americans who refuse or resist confiscation of firearms banned by the government. (0:02:32.9) Who had no authority constitutionally to enact such a ban.

CD: I’m an OK. I’m in the 1st Light Armor Reconnaissance Battalion out of Camp Pendleton, California. I can’t imagine that we’re living in the times where I have to worry about having to confiscate weapons from Americans. Is that freedom? Absolutely not. That I have to worry that we’re going to quarantine a city for the purpose of keeping them hostage, like Katrina? That’s not freedom in any way you can think of it. I’m almost speechless when I try to talk about this because I can’t imagine that we’re living in this kind of time. It really bothers me.

GC: (0:03:31.5) Because of the quotation from President Clinton on March 11, 1993, because of the Assault Weapons Ban, I formed a scenario that I knew would be explosive. Shouldn’t have been, but because of the times and the machinations of certain forces to disarm the American people.

DG: I don’t care whether it’s your governor, senator, representative, or president. I’m sure there are instances of people violating their oath within days of taking it. That’s a dangerous thing. 

## Montage of presidents taking their oath of office

SR: None of this stuff would be happening if they had stuck with the Constitution. (0:04:32.0)

CN: We learned the American dream and were doing that. We were electing representatives we thought would represent us, while we were doing other things, raising our families. I think we were duped in some cases, they’ve let us down.

SR: I saw a tremendous pattern of growth of the infrastructure of a totalitarian state in the last 8 years, post 9/11. It’s been going on for decades, encroachments on our liberties. Then a crisis would come along and they had a chance to get their policies passed. That’s what I saw as incredibly alarming. The concept of enemy combatant status itself is an extension of that. When I was at Yale, I wrote a paper on enemy combatant status that won their award for best paper on the Bill of Rights. Unfortunately, when Obama was elected, he didn’t repeal any of those things. (0:05:27.7) He has left that in place, which is the pattern of all presidents. Whether it’s a left boot or a right boot on the back of your neck, we just don’t want the boot.

DG: He stands on that office on the condition of the oath. 

SR: When you swore an oath to defend the Constitution, you took an individual obligation to make your own decision on the spot of where that line is, whether an order is lawful or unlawful. You have an obligation to do so. As the Nazis found out at Nuremberg, just following orders is no excuse.

GAC: 95% of the Christian Church supported Hitler, which is terrifying. We need to wake up and not assume that our fellow citizens won’t hurt us. 

GL: I would say to any pastor or anyone in the military, should we have a breakdown in this country, stay by your Bible and stay by the Constitution. Remember in the history of this world, the terrible debacle of what happened in Nazi Germany when the Church did not stand by those innocent people, the Jewish people who were exterminated.

GC: My god, how did we ever allow our government to reach such a point?

AJ: What’s happening to the US is very sad. Because we’ve seen it done to third world nations over and over again.

LB: (0:07:11.0) I’d like to ask all of you to realize the solemn nature of this occasion. Those of you who so choose will swear an oath, a pretty serious proposition.

UM: You’ll never have anything in your life as valuable as your word. If we all do nothing more than fulfil our oath, we can turn things around just on that.

DG: It takes relatively few faithful servants to defuse a lot of mischief in times of crisis, if they merely hold to their oath.

LB: If you can’t swear that oath, please mentally excuse yourself and don’t participate. I for one intend to honor this oath. We are in perilous times. Not quite so perilous or perhaps more perilous than in 1775. Please raise your hand thusly. When I say “I,” pronounce your own name. I, Larry Bailey, do solemnly swear or affirm that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies foreign and domestic.

## LB is leading people in swearing the oath here.

LB: That I will bear truth faith and allegiance to the same. That I take this obligation freely without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion. Pledging my life, my fortune, and my sacred honor, so help me god. Welcome my brothers and sisters to our grateful country.
 SR: OK is an association of active-duty military, police officers, and veterans, all of us who swore our oath and will keep our oath and will honor our oath. If you swore an oath to defend the Constitution, honor your oath by joining us, OK, become an OK.

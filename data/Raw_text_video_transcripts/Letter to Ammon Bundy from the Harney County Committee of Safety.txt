S1: We’ve only been on this committee a couple of weeks. 2 weeks ago, I didn’t know what a Committee of Safety was. So I looked up the definition, and I’m going to read that to you before I read this letter from the Committee of Safety. (0:00:17.0)

S1: The first Committee of Safety was formed prior to the Revolutionary War to fight the tyranny and oppression of a corrupt government and its officials, and to protect the safety, health, and welfare of the local citizens. That’s the definition of a Committee of Safety, and its three or four hundred years old. (0:00:38.6)

S1: Ammon, the Harney County Committee of Safety, as it was originally named, delivers this letter to you, the voice of those occupying the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge Headquarters. We thank you for shining light on the Hammond case here in Harney County. Your actions have created a national focus on the Hammonds and other issues here and across the West that have created mutual distrust, anger, and unrest between the people of the land and the federal government. We thank you for stirring us to action, which we hope will peaceably lead to justice for the Hammonds and ultimately a better Harney County, a better state, and a better nation. (0:01:32.2) We were very upset that you chose to take the aggressive action of occupying the refuge and did it without our knowledge or any other local approval, and in the fashion that created huge distrust and loss of credibility of and for us as a group of residents within the community. We approved of most of your message but disapprove of your unilateral methods of occupation. With that being said, we feel that any good which may come out of this event has reached its full potential. We ask that you organize your people, explain that your point has been made, and leave in a peaceful and honorable fashion (0:02:23.5). This will allow us in Harney County to carry on with the business of improving the lives and opportunities that our beautifully blessed country offers through its bounty and natural resources. Peace be with you. 

JVT: (0:02:42.7) I’m with OK, I’m the national media director. I came from Rexford, Montana. I’ve been on every operation that OK has had since Bundy Ranch on. I’ve gotta say, I’m very excited about what you’re talking about, and how you’re speaking. This can be a model that can replicate across the country. This is endemic across the West. It’s affecting all of us. If we figure it out here. This is what we try to get from local communities when they’re having these problems, is to act for themselves on a local level. And you guys are doing that. I just want to say, this is exactly what we want to hear. If we can help in any way. We’ve never had a bullet fly, we’ve never had one drop of blood. I go to these things with a camera and a microphone, I never bring a gun. I just want to say, you guys are doing the right thing, keep the courage up there, make this a model for the rest of the country.

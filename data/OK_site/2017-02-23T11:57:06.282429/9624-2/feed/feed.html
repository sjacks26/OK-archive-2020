<content:encoded>Thanks Brandon, Ya, I have an M1A Scout plain Jane and it sure doesn’t shoot .5 MOA but it is good to go out to 600 yrds.

<content:encoded>Obvious that the unrestrained creation of trillions of dollars should result in much higher prices of any REAL goods and in particular ‘needful items’. Paper promises are only worth the paper and ink they are printed on when the promise cannot be fulfilled, and now the paper has been replaced with electronic bits that are intrinsically worth nothing.<br/>
Have not, but will “Check out my website, Alt-Market.com,”. Are you referencing to the CPT section when you state “as well as Oathkeepers.org for more information on real solutions to a collapse scenario.”

<content:encoded>Raw land is land that has not been developed, usually in rural areas away from major population centers.  
<p>The Rifle is an M1A with a Troy rail.  It is set up as an overwatch rifle and I’m currently getting .5 MOA groups at 100 yards out of it.  It’s my favorite rifle but it is definitely heavier than an AR.</p>

<content:encoded>Steve’s ignorance on my position is so elaborate it’s hard to know where to begin.  Let’s just get to the core issue here – some people think that criticism of the Israeli government is the same as anti-semitism and is off limits.  I disagree.  ALL governments are subject to criticism for their crimes.  
<p>Second I highly recommend you read the works of Israeli professor and historian Iian Pappe, who thoroughly documented the ethnic cleansing of Palestinians by the Israeli government using THEIR OWN RECORDS AND FILES.  Is he “anti-semitic”, or is he just relaying the facts?  Your attempt to derail discussion into a debate over my character is laughable.</p>

<content:encoded>Brandon if you don’t mind me asking, what is raw land? and what type of firearm is that in the photo? M1A?

<content:encoded>Every time I start to pay attention to this guy, he goes on an anti Israel jag.
<p><a href="http://www.alt-market.com/articles/1166-the-truth-about-the-israel-palestine-conflict" rel="nofollow">http://www.alt-market.com/articles/1166-the-truth-about-the-israel-palestine-conflict</a></p>
<p>He also has no problem trying to tell Christians what they believe, and then misrepresenting us. In the same article he pushes replacement theology, the strictly Roman/Greek/pagan interpretation:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.alt-market.com/articles/2544-israel-isis-and-the-end-of-days" rel="nofollow">http://www.alt-market.com/articles/2544-israel-isis-and-the-end-of-days</a></p>
<p>I pay attention to the guy when the subject is economics. I’ll still pay attention to him to a degree on geopolitics. But he’s always quick to break out the crying towel for the supposedly downtrodden Palestinian Arabs,and  is universally critical of Israel. And when the subject of Israel, Zionism, Jews, and any hint of American support for the Jewish state comes up,  the undercurrent of seething antisemitism is palpable. </p>
<p>And all the rocketing, shootings, bombings and stabbings, not to mention every Arab and Persian state on the planet pledging the destruction of the Jewish people seems to elude him.</p>

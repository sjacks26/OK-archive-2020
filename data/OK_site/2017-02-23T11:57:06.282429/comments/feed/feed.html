<content:encoded>Dana, 
<p>I agree 100%. Those Rights are given to us by our Creator, not the Constitution. The Constitution is there to protect those Rights.</p>

<content:encoded>Woody,
<p>I definitely agree. The Right to Bear Arms cannot be infringed. Inalienable means just that: inalienable.</p>

<content:encoded>Wrong, the Sheriff has the authority to bar the Fed agencies of any actions against his citizens.

<content:encoded>BPST should apply to all Police personnel, not just he “one” they disagree with. He’s a great Sheriff, he protects the people in his County and respects the Constitution, unlike those in Power running Oregon. Not everybody is in agreement with this crime on the part of the Fed’s, who manipulated the state police to do their duty work. Even the legislators are on board with this cover-up, just passing house Bill 4087 that shields the names of the Officers that killed Mr. Finicum. Oregon is Corruption at it’s finest, from the governor down to city hall.

<content:encoded>Shorty Dawkins,
<p>I agree, and you must agree that the government’s infringement upon our right to keep and bear arms is also not what the Constitution is all about, no matter how “reasonable” the infringements.  Quite the contrary. The rights guaranteed by the 2nd Amendment are just as much a part of OUR Constitution as is the 1st Amendment. Bear in mind that no government in the history of mankind has ever instituted an unreasonable law, and that all laws are conceived with the best of intentions.  We all know where that road leads.<br/>

<p>“Progressives” are in full, eye-rolling feeding frenzy with “news” that a 14-year-old Muslim student, Ahmed Mohamed, was taken into custody for trying to show his suburban Dallas engineering class teacher a home-built “alarm clock,” only to become the “victim” of … uh … thug cops and xenophobic racists. At least that’s the narrative <strong><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/17/us/texas-student-is-under-police-investigation-for-building-a-clock.html" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/17/us/texas-student-is-under-police-investigation-for-building-a-clock.html', 'The New York Times');" target="_blank">The New York Times</a></strong> and other Fourth Estate Fifth Columnists are parroting on behalf of those whose goal is to culturally terraform America.</p>
<p>Those with an agenda to advance have seized on this seeming made-for-media opportunity.  Cheap H-1B labor-reliant Facebook billionaire <strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/10102373304096361?pnref=story" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/10102373304096361?pnref=story', 'Mark Zuckerberg');" target="_blank">Mark Zuckerberg</a></strong> gushed his desire to meet the young man, along with a prophecy of sorts that “the future belongs to people like Ahmed.” <strong><a href="https://twitter.com/hillaryclinton/status/644167278196600832" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'https://twitter.com/hillaryclinton/status/644167278196600832', 'Hillary Clinton');" target="_blank">Hillary Clinton</a></strong>, ever the political opportunist, tweeted “Assumptions and fear don’t keep us safe—they hold us back. Ahmed, stay curious and keep building.” <strong><a href="https://twitter.com/POTUS/status/644193755814342656" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'https://twitter.com/POTUS/status/644193755814342656', 'Barack Obama');" target="_blank">Barack Obama</a></strong> also capitalized on another way to help fundamentally transform America by tweeting an invitation to Ahmed to bring his clock to the White House.</p>
<p>As the tweets demonstrate, the power of social media has been unleashed, with the hashtag <strong><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/istandwithahmed" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'https://twitter.com/hashtag/istandwithahmed', '#Istandwithahmed');" target="_blank">#Istandwithahmed</a></strong> trending around the world – at least those parts of it that allow unfettered internet access, which <strong><a href="http://www.sudantribune.com/spip.php?article53257" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.sudantribune.com/spip.php?article53257', 'do not appear to include the Sudan');" target="_blank">do not appear to include the Sudan</a></strong>, the place Ahmed’s father immigrated from.</p>
<p>White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest decried “pernicious stereotypes.” Texas Democrats called Ahmed’s detention “a logical conclusion to Islamophobia in Irving and it’s deplorable.” Pretty convenient, at a time when bringing “refugees” into the West is a top priority for both <strong><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/11/world/middleeast/obama-directs-administration-to-accept-10000-syrian-refugees.html" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/11/world/middleeast/obama-directs-administration-to-accept-10000-syrian-refugees.html', 'the administration');" target="_blank">the administration</a></strong> and <strong><a href="http://www.express.co.uk/news/world/555434/Islamic-State-ISIS-Smuggler-THOUSANDS-Extremists-into-Europe-Refugees" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.express.co.uk/news/world/555434/Islamic-State-ISIS-Smuggler-THOUSANDS-Extremists-into-Europe-Refugees', 'the Islamic State');" target="_blank">the Islamic State</a></strong>. Guess what accusation that makes people opposing the “resettlement” vulnerable to?</p>
<p>And it’s not like they have <a href="../red-green-axis-spells-out-danger-threatening-to-destroy-the-republic/index.html" target="_blank"><strong>cause for concern</strong></a>, is it?</p>
<p>Let’s cut through all the “progressive” mob-inciting and indignant outrage, and review a few realities.</p>
<p>First of all, sorry that “pernicious stereotypes” have worked their way into the public consciousness. Gee, I wonder how associating them with young Muslim males ever got started in the first place.</p>
<p>Second, look at how schools have been conditioned by the establishment to respond to anything outside of sanctioned items and materials.  Look at kids that have been “officially” harassed over absurd “zero tolerance” policies for “violations” as ridiculous as wearing an<strong> <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/us/2014/03/13/new-york-high-school-suspended-for-nra-pro-2nd-amendment-t-shirt/" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.foxnews.com/us/2014/03/13/new-york-high-school-suspended-for-nra-pro-2nd-amendment-t-shirt/', 'NRA t-shirt');" target="_blank">NRA t-shirt</a></strong> or bringing in a <strong><a href="http://www.people.com/article/wonder-woman-lunchbox-banned" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.people.com/article/wonder-woman-lunchbox-banned', 'Wonder Woman lunchbox');" target="_blank">Wonder Woman lunchbox</a></strong>.</p>
<p>Now consider the contraption Ahmed built, described as “made … out of a metal briefcase-style box, a digital display, wires and a circuit board. It was bigger and bulkier than a typical bedside clock, with cords, screws and electrical components.”  Who among us would look at that and think “alarm clock”? And who among us can explain the functional difference between a clock that sets to trigger a mechanical action at a predetermined time to wake you up and a timer for something else?</p>
<p>Then consider if the goal was to build an alarm clock, there are much more elegant and versatile, not to mention smaller solutions than the freaky Rube Goldberg/Borg (GoldBorg?) chimera Ahmed assembled. If a 14-year-old had come up on his own with something like <strong><a href="http://makezine.com/projects/s-m-a-r-t-alarm-clock/" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://makezine.com/projects/s-m-a-r-t-alarm-clock/', 'this DIY S.M.A.R.T. project');" target="_blank">this DIY S.M.A.R.T. project</a></strong>, I could understand Zuckerberg considering him a prodigy that the head of a tech company might be interested in nurturing. It appears Ahmed’s usefulness lies in other areas.</p>
<p>The bottom line is, the English teacher from a later class who reported Ahmed after his device “beeped” in class knew him and interacted with him on a regular basis.  In, spite of that, or possibly because of it, her reaction was to wonder if indeed his circuit board gizmo might “possibly [be] the infrastructure for a bomb.”</p>
<p>For that, <strong><a href="http://cityofirving.org/DocumentCenter/View/16607" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://cityofirving.org/DocumentCenter/View/16607', 'she and the police');" target="_blank">she and the police</a></strong> — who responded responsibly and in good faith, and who had no way of knowing otherwise until they’d had a chance to investigate — are now the subjects of “progressive” condemnation. As is anyone who believe a prime function of government is to secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our posterity, as opposed to flooding the Republic with inimical alien cultures.</p>
<p>The Opposite Day madness of the ginned up outrage is that the teacher did exactly what Obama’s Department of Homeland Security tells citizens to do – hell, they’ve even trademarked it:</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="http://www.dhs.gov/see-something-say-something" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.dhs.gov/see-something-say-something', 'If You See Something Say Something ™');" target="_blank">I<strong>f You See Something Say Something ™</strong></a></p></blockquote>
<p>“Suspicious activity is any observed behavior that could indicate terrorism or terrorism-related crime,” DHS instructs. “This includes, but is not limited to: Unusual items or situations.”</p>
<p>I’d say Ahmed’s timer qualifies as an unusual item emerging from an unusual situation, wouldn’t you?</p>
<p>“Some of these activities could be innocent,” DHS advises. “[I]t’s up to law enforcement to determine whether the behavior warrants investigation.”</p>
<p>Isn’t that EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED?  And what’s got all the Prozis, from the president on down, screaming about what racists conservative white Americans are?</p>
<p>Here’s a further test that anyone can do, but I wouldn’t actually advise it:</p>
<p>Next time you have to fly, bring “a metal briefcase-style box, a digital display, wires and a circuit board … with cords, screws and electrical components” — one that beeps — and tell Obama’s TSA it’s your carry-on. Let’s see if you’re treated more gently than Ahmed, and if Mark Zuckerberg invites you to Facebook HQ.</p>
<p>Next, assuming you’re released and whole, take it to a Hillary campaign event and try to walk it past Secret Service security. If they give you any guff, just tell them assumptions and fears don’t make her safe.</p>
<p>Finally, again with the assumption that you’ve emerged from steps one and two unscathed, note that they still give <strong><a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/participate/tours-and-events" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'https://www.whitehouse.gov/participate/tours-and-events', 'White House tours');" target="_blank">White House tours</a></strong>. Guess where the briefcase is going next?</p>
<p>But you don’t need to complete that last test, because we already have an opportunity to see how much more tolerant the administration is than us xenophobe extremists – on October 9, Ahmed, along with “scientists, engineers, astronauts, teachers and students” are going to the White House “to spend a night stargazing from the South Lawn.”</p>
<p>Why not let them all bring metal briefcases filled with wires and components to the event, and further, let them all get as close to the president as Ahmed was to his teachers and classmates, and let it all happen with absolutely no armed protector intervention. With all the blood dancing Prozis like to do after school violence incidents, no one is going to suggest their lives aren’t as precious as Obama’s, are they?</p>
<p>Because, to be consistent, that would be racist and xenophobic, right? That would be every other accusation now being leveled against anyone who thinks the reaction in Irving was understandable in light of conditions our rulers have forced Americans to live under.</p>

<content:encoded>One thing not mentioned in this article is buying the best there is or the best you can afford. It makes little sense to buy an article of clothing that will disintegrate in a few months with heavy use in a SHTF scenario. I logged when I was  young man and would save my money and buy the best clothe which made my life much more comfortable and saved me money in the long haul. Carharrts, Filson, Schnee’s, and Danner (made in America) are all high end equipment that will save your life. Some of this stuff can be picked up cheap in used clothing shops in rural areas or estate sales when families liquidate a deceased family member’s old stuff.

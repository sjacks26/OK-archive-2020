<p class="CSSBody"><em>This article was written by Simon Black and originally published at <a href="http://www.sovereignman.com/trends/about-that-strong-dollar-15956/" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.sovereignman.com/trends/about-that-strong-dollar-15956/', 'Sovereign Man');">Sovereign Man</a></em></p>
<p class="CSSBody">I’ll admit that I wasn’t much of an athlete as a kid, at least in any traditional sport.</p>
<p class="CSSBody">(I famously struck out a tee-ball when I was five years old, managing to hit the stationary tee three times in a row. I’m not sure this feat has ever been duplicated before or since.)</p>
<p class="CSSBody">But my parents still enrolled me in all the local sports leagues ’til about sixth or seventh grade– you know, the ones where they <em>have</em> to put your kid in the game as long as you pay the dues.</p>
<p class="CSSBody">Fortunately (or rather unfortunately) they lumped all the sorry kids onto the same basketball squad. Strength in numbers— we all sucked together.</p>
<p class="CSSBody">And, bearing in mind this was the 80s, our opponents wasted no time pulverizing us into dust, then rubbing our noses in defeat.</p>
<p class="CSSBody">Every single game was like a bad Karate Kid sequel… except more guys in skeleton costumes without the climactic Crane Technique victory at the end.</p>
<p class="CSSBody">Occasionally (by which I mean rarely), one of us would miraculously score a basket.</p>
<p class="CSSBody">This was a momentous achievement for us, and one that would be wholeheartedly celebrated by the entire team.</p>
<p class="CSSBody">And invariably there would be someone from the opposing team who would jog by and snarl some pithy 80s sports metaphor, my favorite being “Scoreboard.”</p>
<p class="CSSBody">Now, if you’re not a native English speaker, “scoreboard” is an idiomatic expression generally employed by some gigantic douche-bag to remind people that he’s still winning.</p>
<p class="CSSBody">It basically means, “Whatever you’re saying, doing, or arguing doesn’t matter, because we’re winning.”</p>
<p class="CSSBody">I’ll use an example: “Yeah, the US has $18 trillion in debt and a central bank that’s nearly insolvent… but you know what? Scoreboard.”</p>
<p class="CSSBody">The point being that the dollar is ‘strong’ right now relative to other currencies. A number of currencies from the euro to the Japanese yen, for example, are all near multi-year lows.</p>
<p class="CSSBody">So, who cares about the dollar’s weak fundamentals because it’s so strong right now. Right?</p>
<p class="CSSBody">It’s important to first understand that global capital flows are extremely fickle.</p>
<p class="CSSBody">Central bankers around the world have conjured trillions of currency units– dollars, euros, yen, etc. And those currency units have to find a ‘home’ somewhere.</p>
<p class="CSSBody">If you’re holding $10,000 or even $10 million, many people just stick it in a bank.</p>
<p class="CSSBody">But if you’re sitting on hundreds of billions, you have to find a safe place to park it.</p>
<p class="CSSBody">Traditionally (and absurdly), institutional investors favor government bonds as that ‘safe place’.</p>
<p class="CSSBody">It used to be you could just park it in some western government bond and walk away for a nice dinner and a movie.</p>
<p class="CSSBody">Not anymore. Now you have to be constantly worried and alert.</p>
<p class="CSSBody">Because in an instant, the US government could shut down again. Japan could default on its prodigious debt (in excess of 200% of GDP). The eurozone could come apart.</p>
<p class="CSSBody">Any number of things could happen.</p>
<p class="CSSBody">And as a result, capital regularly shifts from one major currency to another based on the market’s assessment of risk, i.e. which one is the ‘least ugly’ right now.</p>
<p class="CSSBody">At the moment, the US dollar is choice.</p>
<p class="CSSBody">This isn’t necessarily a vote of confidence for the dollar. It’s more like a vote against all the others.</p>
<p class="CSSBody">If big institutional investors must choose between bankrupt America and bankrupt Europe, right now they choose America.</p>
<p class="CSSBody">But this is a decision that can and will be changed in an instant. Just look at the Swiss franc.</p>
<p class="CSSBody">Since September 2011, the Swiss National Bank (SNB) had essentially put a ceiling on the appreciation of the Swiss franc with respect to the euro.</p>
<p class="CSSBody">The franc had been rising for months. And I predicted in July 2011 that the SNB would intervene with some sort of controls.</p>
<p class="CSSBody">They did, shocking the world with this statement on September 6, 2011:</p>
<p class="CSSBody">“With immediate effect, [the SNB] will no longer tolerate a EUR/CHF exchange rate below the minimum rate of CHF 1.20. The SNB will enforce this minimum rate with the utmost determination and is prepared to buy foreign currency<strong> in</strong> <strong>unlimited quantities</strong>.”</p>
<p class="CSSBody">Investors yanked their money and the franc dropped like a stone.</p>
<p class="CSSBody">But a few days ago, the SNB reversed this control. They are now no longer limiting the rise of their currency.</p>
<p class="CSSBody">And the franc soared 10% almost instantly– a HUGE move for a major currency.</p>
<p class="CSSBody">Why did this happen? Because in a universe of options that only includes the dollar and euro, the dollar wins.</p>
<p class="CSSBody">But if you expand that universe even a little bit to include the Swiss franc, suddenly the real truth comes out.</p>
<p class="CSSBody">Investors have far more confidence in Switzerland than the United States. They’d rather hold francs.</p>
<p class="CSSBody">The next one to watch is the Hong Kong dollar.</p>
<p class="CSSBody">Right now the HK dollar is pegged to the US dollar. But I’ve said it before: there may likely come a day when the Hong Kong Monetary Authority stops importing US monetary policy and abandons this peg.</p>
<p class="CSSBody">We’ll see the same immediate surge. And anyone holding HK dollars will have a lot to gain.</p>

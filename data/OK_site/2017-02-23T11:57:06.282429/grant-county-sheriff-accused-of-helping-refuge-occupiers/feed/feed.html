<content:encoded>Wrong, the Sheriff has the authority to bar the Fed agencies of any actions against his citizens.

<content:encoded>BPST should apply to all Police personnel, not just he “one” they disagree with. He’s a great Sheriff, he protects the people in his County and respects the Constitution, unlike those in Power running Oregon. Not everybody is in agreement with this crime on the part of the Fed’s, who manipulated the state police to do their duty work. Even the legislators are on board with this cover-up, just passing house Bill 4087 that shields the names of the Officers that killed Mr. Finicum. Oregon is Corruption at it’s finest, from the governor down to city hall.

<content:encoded>This article will show why the S/heriff is the highest authority in the land. The good thing about a sheriff is he can deputize

<content:encoded>I think you all need to take the time and read the constitution.  The Sheriff is the law of the land, period.  That’s why Ward is getting so much flack.  He gave the Feds permission to do what they did.    <strong> [One word deleted by Elias Alias, editor] </strong>judge Grasty and I have no nuts sheriff Ward were both involved in the BLM land takeover and are only in it to save their own asses.
<p>Feel free to them how you feel.  No threats though.  Oh yeah, I added the Portland FBI email too.   </p>

<content:encoded>You sir, are absolutely correct. The county sheriff is the ranking LEO in any county in the United States.

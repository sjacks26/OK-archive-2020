<p style="text-align: justify;">Michael Boldin from the Tenth Amendment Center sends us this.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>CONSTITUTION DAY</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">These are my thoughts on what it means, and what we need to do. It’s not pretty, but duty is ours…</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">-Michael Boldin<br/>
<a href="http://tenthamendmentcenter.us1.list-manage.com/track/click?u=3a5a3fb1ad250e247bde9f42d&amp;id=c2539ffaa9&amp;e=4e499fd7a4" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://tenthamendmentcenter.us1.list-manage.com/track/click?u=3a5a3fb1ad250e247bde9f42d&amp;id=c2539ffaa9&amp;e=4e499fd7a4', 'Tenth Amendment Center');" target="_blank"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Tenth Amendment Center</span></a></p>
<p>The Constitution was signed on September 17, 1787. Once ratified, it made law that the powers of government would be limited to those which had been delegated to it – and nothing more.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The founders felt so strongly about this principle that a few years later, in order to “prevent misconstruction or abuse” of federal power, they added “further declaratory and restrictive clauses,” including the Tenth Amendment:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.”<br/>
While that Constitution exists on paper, in practice and effect, it has been completely obliterated. What we live under today is not even close.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>HUBRIS</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It has taken many decades of small and large constitutional violations built upon each other to give us what we have today – almost complete lawlessness in Washington D.C. And things aren’t going to get any better if we rely on the two controlling political parties. They are horrible when it comes to the Constitution. Let’s take a look at some major issues.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you were opposed to war in the Bush administration, you’ve still got wars and threats of more wars under Obama.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you were opposed to national health care under Clinton, you got a massive expansion of government health care under George Bush, who laid the groundwork for an even bigger expansion under Obama.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you didn’t like the federal government passing the Patriot Act without even reading it, you’re still getting the same failure to read bills today.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">On the other hand, if you liked the Bush surveillance programs, you’ve gotta love what Obama has done with them!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you oppose this national health care plan, they’ll give you that one. If you oppose today’s spying program, they’ll create a different one tomorrow.  If you oppose one war, you’ll get another war.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Decade in and decade out, the government keeps growing, and your liberty keeps shrinking.  And it doesn’t matter if the person in charge is named Obama, or Bush, or Reagan, or Clinton.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Throughout history, even kings and queens often failed to survive such acts of hubris; but, in “free” America, the major parties that produce all the presidents continue to receive approval through tens of millions of votes.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Where has that gotten people?</p>
<p><strong>IF IT WERE A PRIORITY</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">No matter what side of the political aisle you sit on, the federal government is not your friend. It’s not a friend to the Constitution. And it’s certainly no friend to your liberty.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When you hear politicians and pundits – especially those in Washington D.C. – “celebrate” the Constitution today, know that they’re lying to you.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If the Constitution were their #1 priority, as it should be…</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">You wouldn’t hear them talk about “repeal and replace.” They’d just say “repeal.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">They wouldn’t talk about “reforming” the EPA, they’d end it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">They wouldn’t be pledging to keep Social Security, they’d eliminate it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There wouldn’t be talk of whether or not to “allow” states to chart their own course on marijuana (even though they already are), they’d simply butt out.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The NSA wouldn’t be “reformed” after violating the rights of millions every single day. The people putting those programs into effect would be on trial.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There would be no “common-sense” gun restrictions, and the laws of 1934 and 1968 would be gone.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Asset forfeiture? They’d treat this practice as robbery.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">These are things you’ll probably never hear from politicians in Washington DC, political pundits, schools, candidates or just about anywhere else. It’s generally not in their interest, either. If politicians and their backers were promoting such ideas as eliminating federal programs as unconstitutional, they’d never be able to convince you that they have the power to tell you what kind of health care plan you’ll be getting, how big your toilet can be, what kind of plants you’re allowed to grow, whether or not you’ll be able to defend your family, whom you can buy and sell from, and even when you must send your children to die for them.</p>
<p><strong>THE PATH FORWARD</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Going to the federal government to fix problems created by the federal government is as futile as it is dangerous. It doesn’t work, and it only encourages them to continue violating your rights.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This Constitution Day, pledge to change direction.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>REJECT</strong> their threats, their fear, and their propaganda.<br/>
<strong>REFUSE</strong> their programs, their handouts, and their demands.<br/>
<strong>RESIST</strong> their regulations, their control and their mandates.<br/>
Do some of this, or all of it. Do whatever you can, even if it’s small. Most importantly, do something.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Treat every day like Constitution Day. Ignore and nullify the federal government and all its unconstitutional acts.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It won’t be easy. It will take some serious courage. But if we start this path today, someday a future generation will truly be able to celebrate Constitution Day for what it should be.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A day of liberty.</p>

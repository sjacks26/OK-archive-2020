<p><em>This article was written by Joe A. Wolverton II and originally published at <a href="http://www.thenewamerican.com/usnews/constitution/item/17944-u-s-e-u-statement-calls-for-enforcement-of-un-arms-treaty" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.thenewamerican.com/usnews/constitution/item/17944-u-s-e-u-statement-calls-for-enforcement-of-un-arms-treaty', 'The New American ');">The New American </a></em></p>
<p>At the conclusion of the U.S.-EU Summit held this week in Brussels,   President Obama and his European colleagues released a joint statement   reaffirming their common commitment to civilian disarmament as mandated   in the United Nation’s Arms Trade Treaty (ATT).</p>
<p>While globalist and establishment media reports focus on the summit’s   attention to the events in Crimea, there is a provision at the end of   the statement that is of much greater concern to Americans aware of the   crescendo of calls for restrictions on the right to keep and bear  arms.</p>
<p>Paragraph 33 of the declaration released on March 26 states: “We   reaffirm our joint commitments on non-proliferation, disarmament and   arms control.”</p>
<p>Among other agreements, President Obama, in the name of the United   States, joined with the gathered heads of state in promising: “We will   also work together to promote the entry into force of the Arms Trade   Treaty in 2014.”</p>
<p>Despite significant congressional opposition to the United Nation’s   attempt to confiscate privately owned weapons and ammunition, President   Obama quietly signed his name to a document that if carried out, would   amount to nothing less than the de facto repeal of the Second  Amendment.</p>
<p>In order to appreciate the seriousness of the the Arms Trade Treaty’s   threat to the God-given right to keep and bear arms and to the   constitutional protection of that right, details of the plan should be   understood.</p>
<p>This author attended the negotiations at UN headquarters in Manhattan   where the ATT was hammered out, and I found that the ATT is so   offensive to the preservation of the right to keep and bear arms, it is   an understatement to call it unconstitutional. As <em>The New American</em> has reported, several provisions of this treaty significantly diminish the scope of this basic right.</p>
<p>First, the Arms Trade Treaty grants a monopoly over all weaponry in   the hands of the very entity (government) responsible for over 300   million murders in the 20th century.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the treaty leaves private citizens powerless to oppose future slaughters.</p>
<p>One uncomfortable fact of armed violence ignored by the UN in its   pro-disarmament propaganda is that all the murders committed by all the   serial killers in history don’t amount to a fraction of the brutal   killings committed by “authorized state parties” using the very weapons   over which they will exercise absolute control under the terms of the   Arms Trade Treaty.</p>
<p>Article 2 of the treaty defines the scope of the treaty’s   prohibitions. The right to own, buy, sell, trade, or transfer all means   of armed resistance, including handguns, is denied to civilians by this   section of the Arms Trade Treaty.</p>
<p>Article 3 places the “ammunition/munitions fired, launched or   delivered by the conventional arms covered under Article 2” within the   scope of the treaty’s prohibitions, as well.</p>
<p>Article 4 rounds out the regulations, also placing all “parts and components” of weapons within the scheme.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most immediate threat to the rights of gun owners in the   Arms Trade Treaty is found in Article 5. Under the title of “General   Implementation,” Article 5 mandates that all countries participating in   the treaty “shall establish and maintain a national control system,   including a national control list.”</p>
<p>This list should “apply the provisions of this Treaty to the broadest range of conventional arms.”</p>
<p>Article 12 adds to the record-keeping requirement, mandating that the   list include “the quantity, value, model/type, authorized  international  transfers of conventional arms,” as well as the identity  of the “end  users” of these items.</p>
<p>In very clear terms, ratification of the Arms Trade Treaty by the   United States would require that the U.S. government force gun owners to   add their names to the national registry. Citizens would be required  to  report the amount and type of all firearms and ammunition they  possess.</p>
<p>Section 4 of Article 12 of the treaty requires that the list be kept for at least 10 years.</p>
<p>Finally, the agreement demands that national governments take   “appropriate measures” to enforce the terms of the treaty, including   civilian disarmament. If these countries can’t get this done on their   own, however, Article 16 provides for UN assistance, specifically   including help with the enforcement of “stockpile management,   disarmament, demobilization and reintegration programmes.”</p>
<p>In fact, a “voluntary trust fund” will be established to assist those   countries that need help from UN peacekeepers or other regional forces   to disarm their citizens.</p>
<p>While President Obama has kept mostly mum lately on the ATT,   especially in the face of such strident congressional opposition, the   European Union has come right out and called for the enactment of the   globalist gun grab.</p>
<p>On February 5, the European Parliament voted to authorize EU countries to ratify the ATT.</p>
<p>In a less-than-enthusiastic press release, the European Parliament   declared that the Arms Trade Treaty “wouldn’t necessarily result in the   reduction of arms production, but it should stop arms getting into the   hands of terrorists and should stop arms flooding into areas that are   unstable.”</p>
<p>That’s sounds troubling. Given the proclivity of regimes to label   dissenters as “terrorists” and to nominate the United States as a   battlefield in the global “War on Terror,” however, the rights protected   by the Second Amendment are most certainly under attack in the form of   this globalist gun grab masquerading as a peace treaty.</p>
<p>David Martin, a British member of the Group of the Progressive   Alliance of Socialists and Democrats who helped draft the recommendation   for EU member ratification of the ATT, admitted that the aim of the   treaty is control of firearms. “There are weaknesses in the treaty, but   it’s nevertheless a major step forward. This is the first time that   conventional weapons have been put under any sort of control at all,”   Martin said in an interview with the EU press.</p>
<p>Statements such as this are an admission against the interest of the   perpetuation of the right to keep and bear arms, particularly in light   of the president’s co-signing of the the U.S.-EU summit joint statement   that specifically calls for gun control.</p>
<p>Perhaps President Obama, the self-professed former constitutional law   professor, has forgotten the text of the Second Amendment,  particularly  the phrase “shall not infringe.”</p>
<p>Fortunately, as reported above, a slim majority of senators remain rock-ribbed in their refusal to ratify the ATT.</p>
<p>For now, 50 senators are standing together to protect the right to   keep and bear arms as guaranteed by the Second Amendment and have taken   pen in hand to let the president know how they feel about his plan to   rob their constituents of one of their most basic rights.</p>
<p>In a letter addressed to President Obama, the senators enumerated six   reasons the president should refuse to present the ATT to the Senate   for ratification. Among the objections raised by the senatorial   signatories is the ambiguity of the treaty, as well as the grant to   “foreign sources of authority” the power to “impose judgment or control   on the U.S.”</p>
<p>On the House side, a coalition of 180 members of Congress sent a   letter to the president reaffirming their opposition to the   implementation of the provisions of the Arms Trade Treaty.</p>
<p>While it is not remarkable that Barack Obama supports the seizure of   guns and ammunition from law-abiding Americans, the fact that only half   of the U.S. Senate has come out in defense of the Second Amendment is   noteworthy and should be remembered by citizens who understand that a   disarmed population is a slave population.</p>
<p>In light of the joint statement sanctioning government control of gun   ownership, it seems that the “strong partnership” between the European   Union and the United States might be the wedge President Obama uses to   separate Americans from their firearms and their freedom.</p>

<content:encoded>William McCasland, I checked the records that OK national has for paid up members as of jan.,2015. I didn’t see your name. that being said, you are still a member of our CT chapter-you dont have to pay money to be a member of our CT chapter. as long as you take our oath seriously and live by it, you are a member in good standing with our chapter. call my cell# above and we can talk if you want. In Liberty, Steven LaPlante, CTOK SCP

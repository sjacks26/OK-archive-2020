<content:encoded>Amen!  I am glad to see someone is paying attention.  The one’s with their heads in the sand will find out soon enough.

<content:encoded>The first sentence of your statement says it all.  You didn’t read it.  That’s why you stick your head back into the sand.  Denial of facts representative in the article causes you to remain ignorant.<br/>
Soros will get his in the end, as will the rest of the people responsible for the deaths of millions.<br/>
Well written article, and I appreciate the Oath Keeper’s for keeping it in front of the public.

<content:encoded>Honestly, I couldn’t read every word. Too many suggestive ‘facts’. My eyes started glazing over with  talk of Rothchild, bilderberg, etc. IMO, either take several steps back toward simplicity or one step forward and generalize that problems and obstacles are the nature of the world. Trying to explain the complexity of the world is a waste of time and always inaccurate.
<p>For example, Soros is the bane of central bankers. He is the destroyer of shitty currencies. Good for him. I thank him. It makes sense that China is running scared and may be threatening him to butt out of playing its currency. But then he spends the resulting money promoting more socialist, anti-gun, agenda 21 bullshit. If I didn’t know better, I would think he was purposefully trying to create more crappy currencies to repeat the cycle. But the truth is, it’s just the nature of the world. Nothing like the complicated, conspiracy-laden, faux-analytical explanation of the above article.</p>

While the patriots with the Pacific Patriot Network were busy battling against snow packed fire hydrants. That’s right the so called thugs and militia men that have been accused of intimidation and threats against the good people of Harney County were actually out performing a community service by removing snow from local snow packed fire hydrants. During this work they took the time to talk to many of the residents of Burns, OR. They explained why they there and tried to assuage fears. These community service related tactics do not play well into the game plan of the powers that be. It is essential that the people of Harney County be kept in the dark and scared of what is happening in their own back yard. They are desperately pushing back with a dis-information campaign of their own. Here is what Dave Ward, the Harney County Sheriff stated this Monday <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2016/01/12/us/oregon-armed-protesters/" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.cnn.com/2016/01/12/us/oregon-armed-protesters/', 'according to CNN.com');">according to CNN.com</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>“Since those occupying the Malheur Wildlife Refuge came to town, there has been an increase in the number of “vandalism, harassment, and intimidation reports,”</em></p>
<p><em>There are continual reports of law enforcement officers and community members being followed home; of people sitting in cars outside their homes, observing their movements and those of their families; and of people following them and their families as they move around the community.</em></p>
<p><em>While not direct physical threats, these activities are clearly designed to try to intimidate.”</em></p></blockquote>
<p>The problem with this statement is that it is simply not true. From the very beginning we have seen time and time again that the PPN (Pacific Patriot Network / consisting the Idaho III%, Oath Keepers and other Patriot groups) are working as a buffer between the powers that be and those occupying the refuge and are the ones that are actually attempting to reach out to the FBI and local Law Enforcement in order to start crucial dialogs and even bring them coffee and food as gestures of good will. They seem to be doing such a good job that the powers that be launched their co-intel program that seeks to again demonize and demoralize the patriots. This is unfortunate, but to be expected. It is crucial to the powers that be that the good people of Harney County continue to live on in fear and intimidation as those are the best weapons they have to keep them from uncovering information and asking questions about the rampant corruption in the county. This same corruption is what landed the Hammond’s in prison not once, but twice in what has been labeled by the very judge that presided as cruel and unusual punishment according to <a href="https://reason.com/blog/2016/01/04/rancher-arson-case-that-inspired-oregon" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'https://reason.com/blog/2016/01/04/rancher-arson-case-that-inspired-oregon', 'reason.com');">reason.com</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>“Viewing that penalty as clearly unjust given the facts of the case, U.S. District Judge Michael Hogan instead imposed a three-month sentence on Dwight Hammond, who was convicted of one count, and two concurrent one-year sentences on Steven Hammond, who was convicted of two counts. Those terms were within the ranges recommended by federal sentencing guidelines that would have applied but for the statutory minimum, which Hogan rejected as inconsistent with the Eighth Amendment. In 2014 the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit, responding to a government appeal, <a href="http://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2014/02/07/12-30337.pdf" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'download', 'http://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2014/02/07/12-30337.pdf');">disagreed</a> with Hogan, saying he had no choice but to impose five-year sentences on both men, since “a minimum sentence mandated by statute is not a suggestion that courts have discretion to disregard.” That is why the Hammonds, who had already completed their original sentences, were ordered back to federal prison, the development that led to Saturday’s protest.”</em></p></blockquote>
<p>While the Sheriff is accusing the patriots of being the big bad wolf instead of the actual sheep dogs they are, there is clear evidence that the good people of Harney County are also beginning to come together and realize that they have been lied to and abused. In this ground breaking video interview with the now resigned Fire Chief of Harney County, Chris Briels, he</p>
<p><a href="https://www.oathkeepers.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/OR-Harney-County-fire-chief.jpg"><img alt="OR-Harney-County-fire-chief" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-9515" height="168" src="https://www.oathkeepers.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/OR-Harney-County-fire-chief.jpg" width="272"/></a>states that he no longer trusts local government. Briels has served as the Fire Chief since 1984 and has lived in the county since 1978. He began to see the BLM’s actions as land grabbing but what really began his awakening to what is really going on behind the scenes was this past week was the rumors that there were so called Miltia types at the county armory. He sprang into action and went to confront the two men. After following them from the armory through town he pulled them over and began to question them about who they were and why they were at the armory. The lies they responded with were immediately questioned by the Fire Chief. At first claiming to be business men and then hunters, it wasn’t until he had dispatch run their plates that he found that they were actually under cover Federal Agents. After being told to back off the questioning by Judge Steve Grasty, that the Chief, a man of obvious moral character, turned in his resignation to the Judge. Here is an <a href="http://katu.com/news/local/harney-county-fire-chief-resigns-sides-with-armed-protesters" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://katu.com/news/local/harney-county-fire-chief-resigns-sides-with-armed-protesters', 'article regarding this situation by KATU 2');">article regarding this situation by KATU 2</a> and following is his video statement and explanation of the incident.<br/>

<p>We know that unfortunately this type of underhanded mob like tactics are common place amongst the federal and at times local governments. We must at times like these always be sure to rise above and always take the moral high ground.</p>

<p><em>This article was written by Brandon Smith and originally published at <a href="http://www.alt-market.com/articles/2775-oregon-standoff-a-terrible-plan-that-we-might-be-stuck-with" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.alt-market.com/articles/2775-oregon-standoff-a-terrible-plan-that-we-might-be-stuck-with', 'Alt-Market.com');">Alt-Market.com</a></em></p>
<p>Well, there is whole host of things wrong with this situation, which is why I never supported or endorsed “Operation Hammond Freedom” to begin with.  There is a lot of misinformation out there at this time on the debacle in Oregon, and certain alternative media outlets seem to be conveniently overlooking particular facts.  I suspect that some people in the movement simply want to “kick it off” (a second American revolution), and they don’t care if the circumstances of that kick-off are favorable or terrible (I realize “favorable” is relative, but starting this fight from a much stronger position is more than possible).  This attitude was prevalent among some at Bundy Ranch, as certain groups refused to dig in positions for a real fight in the hopes that they would be “martyred” for the cause.  This, in case you were wondering, is idiotic.</p>
<p>Oath Keepers including founder Stewart Rhodes was the <a href="../the-hammond-family-does/index.html">only organization to predict</a> how Ammon Bundy’s vague calls for action on the part of the Hammond Family would actually play out.  They received a lot of ignorant attacks in response, and yet, they were absolutely right.</p>
<p>Ammon, apparently trying to recreate what cannot be recreated, is looking for another Bundy Ranch stand-off.  First, I would point out that such events can’t be artificially fabricated.  They have to happen in an organic way.  Whenever a group of people attempt to engineer a revolutionary moment, even if their underlying motivations are righteous, it usually ends up kicking them in the ass (Fort Sumter is a good example).  Ammon’s wingmen appear to be Blaine Cooper aka Stanley Blaine Hicks (a convicted felon), and Ryan Payne (who claimed falsely during the Bundy Ranch standoff that he was an Army Ranger and who worked diligently to cause divisions between involved parties on the ground).  This was the first sign that nothing good was going to come from the Hammond protest.</p>
<p>I have watched extensive video from the event in Oregon and am privy to accounts from participants.  From the information at my disposal, it would appear that Ammon and team did NOT make clear their intentions to occupy the federal wildlife refuge building except to a select few, inviting protesters to “take a hard stand” without revealing what this would entail until they were already in the middle of it all.  OPSEC?  No, I think not.  Obviously the goal was to lure as many protesters to Oregon as possible to the event in the hopes that they would jump on board with the stand-off plan once they were more personally involved.  Numerous protesters were rightly enraged once they discovered the ultimate motives behind the event.</p>
<p>The plan is basically this – use the Hammond family as a vehicle (yes, this is what is being done) even though they did not want any kind of standoff to result and specifically refused aid.  Occupy federally owned buildings which have little to do with anything of importance and have no symbolic power as did Bundy Ranch.  Elicit federal response.  Wash, rinse, repeat.</p>
<p>Bundy Ranch had many positive elements going for it, which is why it ended the way it did.  This standoff has none of the same elements.  I suppose one could ask, though, why do I care?</p>
<p>It’s true, these people have every right to make positively naive strategic errors and I don’t have to participate directly if I don’t like it.  The problem, however, is that Ammon and friends have decided they want to be the “tip of the spear” (his words, not mine).  I do not think they understand what this means, or they don’t care.  What it means is, even though I think the entire Oregon plan is ill conceived; literally the WORST possible way to launch a fight against federal corruption, if the federal government moves in a heavy handed manner to kill these people, I and many others will have to fight as well by default when a FAR better tactical and social position could have been achieved.  My conscience simply will not allow the rationalization of the deaths of liberty minded people even if their stupidity brought about the circumstances.  And frankly, that pisses me off.</p>
<p>As a student of asymmetrics, I understand that choosing the time, place and circumstances is 95% of the battle ahead against an advanced opponent.  More organization is needed.  More preparedness.  More training.  More public awareness.  The Oregon standoff could steal away what little time we had left.</p>
<p>The Oregon standoff potentially forces the hand of the Liberty Movement, not the hand of corrupt government – the exact reverse of what should be happening.</p>
<p>Mike Vanderboegh has outlined similar thoughts expertly in <a href="http://sipseystreetirregulars.blogspot.com/2016/01/perfect-timing-for-regime-federal.html" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://sipseystreetirregulars.blogspot.com/2016/01/perfect-timing-for-regime-federal.html', 'this article');">this article</a>.  Everything he has written is exactly what was going through my own mind when I heard of the happenings in Oregon.  Ammon Bundy and companions are not the tip of the spear.  Not even close.  What I do fear is that they are cannon fodder beckoning a nationwide government crackdown to which I and others will then be forced to personally respond to with equal f*cking measure.  And all of this on the worst possible terms and at a very inconvenient time (executive actions on gun control mere weeks from now).</p>
<p>And here’s the best part; those of us who remain critical of the clinically retarded maneuver being executed here are going to be called cowards and “keyboard warriors”; it’s a given.  We are all ready to fight for the future of this country, we have been training diligently for it and helping many others along the way.  But, because we do not support two dimensional planning there are those that will say – “Now we find out who the real patriots are!”</p>
<p>Against stupid plan = coward against freedom and action.  Just watch.</p>
<p>If the Feds use brutality to handle the Oregon conflict, it will indeed “kick-off”.  There wont be any way to stop it.  Just don’t get too excited, folks.  This is no Lexington or Concord.  I really don’t know what to call it…</p>

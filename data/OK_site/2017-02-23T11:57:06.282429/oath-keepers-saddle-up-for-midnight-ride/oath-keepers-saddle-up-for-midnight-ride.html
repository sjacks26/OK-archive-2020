<p>–</p>
<p><strong>James Jaeger</strong> is at it again. After working with Oath Keepers to produce a documentary film on the Second Amendment, (<a href="http://www.oathkeepersgear.net/DVD-Molon-Labe_p_92.html" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.oathkeepersgear.net/DVD-Molon-Labe_p_92.html', 'MOLON LABE');" target="_blank"><strong><em>MOLON LABE</em></strong></a>), whick focused on the<em> first part</em> of the Second Amendment — the Constitutional Militia of the several States —  James is now creating a sister film entitled Midnight Ride. James has invited Oath Keepers to work with his Matrix Entertainment studios to produce this new movie/documentary, and I am excited and pleased to announce to all Oath Keepers and our patriot friends that Oath Keepers will play a significant role in the production of this film.</p>
<p>Many of our new members will be glad to discover that James Jaeger has built a library of documentary films dealing with Constitutional issues. The entire collection is available at his YouTube site, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLVCYZiC20h35tqdAc78DYKeMIwHrFSwwb" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLVCYZiC20h35tqdAc78DYKeMIwHrFSwwb', 'here');" target="_blank">here</a>:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLVCYZiC20h35tqdAc78DYKeMIwHrFSwwb" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLVCYZiC20h35tqdAc78DYKeMIwHrFSwwb', 'https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLVCYZiC20h35tqdAc78DYKeMIwHrFSwwb');" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLVCYZiC20h35tqdAc78DYKeMIwHrFSwwb</a></p>
<p>As it most directly relates to the newest film project, I personally would recommend viewing first up the documentary on the Second Amendment, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofrhqP7JWaA&amp;index=1&amp;list=PLVCYZiC20h35tqdAc78DYKeMIwHrFSwwb" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofrhqP7JWaA&amp;index=1&amp;list=PLVCYZiC20h35tqdAc78DYKeMIwHrFSwwb', 'MOLON LABE');" target="_blank"><strong><em>MOLON LABE</em></strong></a>.</p>
<p>James Jaeger is proud to include Ron Paul and G. Edward Griffin in all of his Constitution-based films thus far. Pat Buchanan sometimes appears. Larry Pratt will be in his second film now. In MOLON LABE Stewart Rhodes and Chuck Baldwin were featured, as they will be in this new film. Enjoy these films for free at that above link and if you want to help out with the production of Midnight Ride and get a screen credit for yourself personally or for your organization, click <a href="http://www.midnightride.us/donate/" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.midnightride.us/donate/', 'here');" target="_blank"><em><strong>here</strong></em></a> to contribute.</p>
<p>James has likened the production of this movie to the famous and iconic “midnight ride” of Paul Revere. Let’s briefly revisit that night in history now, beginning with quoted lines from Longfellow, available at the <a href="http://www.paulreverehouse.org/ride/" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.paulreverehouse.org/ride/', 'Paul Revere House');" target="_blank"><strong><em>Paul Revere House</em></strong></a> museum:</p>
<p align="center"><strong><em>Listen, my children, and you shall hear</em></strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong><em>Of the midnight ride of Paul Revere,</em></strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong><em>On the eighteenth of April, in Seventy-five;</em></strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong><em>Hardly a man is now alive</em></strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong><em>Who remembers that famous day and year.</em></strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong><em>He said to his friend, “If the British march</em></strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong><em>By land or sea from the town to-night,</em></strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong><em>Hang a lantern aloft in the belfry arch</em></strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong><em>Of the North Church tower as a signal light,</em></strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong><em>One, if by land, and two, if by sea;</em></strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong><em>And I on the opposite shore will be,</em></strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong><em>Ready to ride and spread the alarm</em></strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong><em>Through every Middlesex village and farm</em></strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong><em>For the country folk to be up and to arm.</em></strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong><em>–<br/>
</em></strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Additionally from the Paul Revere House museum, a factual accounting of that midnight ride:</strong></p>
<p><em>In 1774 and the Spring of 1775 Paul Revere was employed by the Boston Committee of Correspondence and the Massachusetts Committee of Safety as an express rider to carry news, messages, and copies of resolutions as far away as New York and Philadelphia.</em></p>
<p><em>On the evening of April 18, 1775, Paul Revere was sent for by Dr. Joseph Warren and instructed to ride to Lexington, Massachusetts, to warn Samuel Adams and John Hancock that British troops were marching to arrest them. After being rowed across the Charles River to Charlestown by two associates, Paul Revere borrowed a horse from his friend Deacon John Larkin. While in Charlestown, he verified that the local “Sons of Liberty” committee had seen his pre-arranged signals. (Two lanterns had been hung briefly in the bell-tower of Christ Church in Boston, indicating that troops would row “by sea” across the Charles River to Cambridge, rather than marching “by land” out Boston Neck. Revere had arranged for these signals the previous weekend, as he was afraid that he might be prevented from leaving Boston).</em></p>
<p><em>On the way to Lexington, Revere “alarmed” the country-side, stopping at each house, and arrived in Lexington about midnight. As he approached the house where Adams and Hancock were staying, a sentry asked that he not make so much noise. “Noise!” cried Revere, “You’ll have noise enough before long. The regulars are coming out!” After delivering his message, Revere was joined by a second rider, William Dawes, who had been sent on the same errand by a different route. Deciding on their own to continue on to Concord, Massachusetts, where weapons and supplies were hidden, Revere and Dawes were joined by a third rider, Dr. Samuel Prescott. Soon after, all three were arrested by a British patrol. Prescott escaped almost immediately, and Dawes soon after. Revere was held for some time and then released. Left without a horse, Revere returned to Lexington in time to witness part of the battle on the Lexington Green.</em></p>
<p>–</p>
<p><strong>The importance of documenting Constitutional knowledge</strong> for the future cannot be over-stated. Americans today are faced with social stresses, urban discontent, high taxation, the militarizing of our local police, a prevalent attitude of futility which breeds the general apathy, uncertain global concerns relating to markets and economics, wars and rumors of wars, earthquakes in divers’ places, seasonal diversions in our weather patterns, gmo food subversion, high suicide rates among Veterans and Veterans’ families, White House scandals such as arming the Mexican drug cartels (the ATF’s criminal “Fast and Furious”), Benghazi, Seal Team Six deaths in Afghanistan, the IRS targeting Tea Party groups, and an incessant preoccupation by the Executive Branch for “ruling” by fiat in the face of a bought-and-paid-for Legislative Branch. All of that and much more remind us daily of the remarkable flood of criminality issuing forth from Washington D.C.</p>
<p>America seems to have lost her way, and we at Oath Keepers feel that Americans now need to refresh and expand their understanding of the Constitution for the united States of America. Every individual Oath Keeper is, first and foremost, a “Guardian of the Republic”.  We have sworn to protect and defend our Constitution. Our position is that if the American people can work through their States, as Thomas Jefferson and James Madison said we should, to control the General government in WDC, we could return this nation to its Constitutional roots and thereby preserve American-styled liberty and freedom for all Americans for generations to come.  Our way of life is under severe attack today even as the Colonists were under attack by the British overlords in the 1770s. The nation’s vulnerability is rooted in a general apathy, which is now a challenge for our RT&amp;I program. We must Reach, Teach, and Inspire not only the police and military, but also the American people in general.</p>
<p>We at Oath Keepers take pride in accepting James Jaeger’s invitation to participate in production of another very classy and very Constitutionally-based film about the four types of “martial law”. We will thereby go on the record for all time, just as we did in helping produce MOLON LABE!, by helping create a very timely rendition of the facts surrounding the build-up of a militarized police state in America which is now an obvious <a href="https://oathkeepers.org/oath/2011/06/21/an-empire-strikes-home-_-part-two/" target="_blank"><strong><em>extension</em></strong></a> of Federal departments and agencies like the Department of Defense (<strong><a href="http://www.defense.gov/Speeches/Speech.aspx?SpeechID=1092" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.defense.gov/Speeches/Speech.aspx?SpeechID=1092', 'DOD');" target="_blank">DOD</a></strong>) and the Department of Homeland Security (<a href="https://oathkeepers.org/oath/2011/11/09/an-empire-strikes-home_part-five/" target="_blank"><strong>DHS</strong></a><a href="https://oathkeepers.org/oath/2011/06/21/an-empire-strikes-home-_-part-two/" target="_blank">)</a> and the Department of Justice (<a href="http://www.cnn.com/2013/08/27/world/americas/operation-fast-and-furious-fast-facts/" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.cnn.com/2013/08/27/world/americas/operation-fast-and-furious-fast-facts/', 'DOJ');" target="_blank"><strong>DOJ</strong></a>).  All of that idiocy is prelude to something the media has been discretely inserting into the public mind for a couple of decades or more — the advent of “Martial Law”.</p>
<p>“Martial Law” is what this film is all about. Inspired by the latest book by Dr. Edwin Vieira, Jr., <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Tyranny-Out-Necessity-Bastardy-Martial/dp/0967175976/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1416733104&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=edwin+vieira+by+tyranny+out+of+necessity" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.amazon.com/Tyranny-Out-Necessity-Bastardy-Martial/dp/0967175976/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1416733104&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=edwin+vieira+by+tyranny+out+of+necessity', 'By Tyranny Out Of Necessity: The Bastardy Of “Martial Law”');" target="_blank"><strong>By Tyranny Out Of Necessity: <em>The Bastardy Of “Martial Law”</em></strong></a><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Tyranny-Out-Necessity-Bastardy-Martial/dp/0967175976/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1416733104&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=edwin+vieira+by+tyranny+out+of+necessity" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.amazon.com/Tyranny-Out-Necessity-Bastardy-Martial/dp/0967175976/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1416733104&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=edwin+vieira+by+tyranny+out+of+necessity', '.');" target="_blank"><strong><em>.</em></strong></a> In this excellent writing by Dr. Vieira we learn of the four types of “martial law” and we learn what the Constitution has to say about each type. This is one of the most important books I’ve ever read. As with his other published books, Dr. Vieira spares no effort in foot-noting superb sources for everything he asserts in his text. It is my unqualified opinion that Dr. Vieira’s writing is the apex of academic excellence, pure as April’s rain and meticulously interconnected to give the reader finally a full grasp of the Founders’ original intent in the creation of our Constitution. It is academic validation of our passion to preserve the traditional American culture, and as such it engenders great hope for all Americans. In reading this book James Jaeger became inspired to create another in his series of Constitutional documentaries, this new film named “Midnight Ride”.</p>
<p>I am going to share with you some ideas for ways in which Oath Keepers can help get this film completed, especially those who cannot contribute money to the project. But first let’s look at the movie as it is in its infancy.</p>
<p>The website for the film is online and developing now. There we can find the script and a brief initial (not the final) trailer. Using just brief snippets, James has a blip of our Oath Keepers logo banner at the beginning of the film, and a brief clip mentioning our Ten Orders We Shall Not Obey.  I’ve read several re-writes of the script as it has been honed by James and Edwin Vieira, and am very pleased that James has worked our Ten Orders into the movie so nicely. This film will be the most powerful record of the Oath Keepers mission available to the public to date, and that is what inspires me to give it my all by way of helping it come together.  Talk about “RT&amp;I”, well my goodness!, this is an RT&amp;I Psy-Op par excellence!  If the Internet were to go down in a sun-surface flare-up (coronal loop sending electro-magnetic pulses to earth) this movie will yet abide, and that fact is comforting to me and to Oath Keepers national. Speaking of Oath Keepers national:</p>
<p>Oath Keepers national Chaplain Chuck Baldwin will be in the film. Oath Keepers Board member Sheriff Mack will be in the film. Also will appear Stewart Rhodes, Founder and President of Oath Keepers, and, to my surprise, so will I.  The list of women and men who will be in the film runs thusly:</p>
<p>Dan Happel, David R. Gillie, Edwin Vieira, JR., Elias Alias, G. Edward Griffin, John W. Cones, Larry Pratt, Pastor Chuck Baldwin, Rosie Haas, Sheriff Mack, Stewart Rhodes, Walter Reddy, and Devvy Kidd.</p>
<p>Others you will recognize by name are being asked at present to appear in the film. We will keep readers here advised. Speaking of that allow me please to reprint here parts of the last update I received from James Jaeger:</p>
<p><strong>James Jaeger speaking:</strong></p>
<p>MIDNIGHT RIDE is inspired by Edwin Vieira’s newly-released book, <strong>BY TYRANNY OUT OF NECESSITY: <em>The Bastardy of Martial Law</em></strong> which is available at <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Tyranny-Out-Necessity-Bastardy-Martial/dp/0967175976/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1409002591&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=edwin+vieira" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.amazon.com/Tyranny-Out-Necessity-Bastardy-Martial/dp/0967175976/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1409002591&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=edwin+vieira', 'Amazon.com');" target="_blank">Amazon.com</a>.  MIDNIGHT RIDE is the sister film to MOLON LABE, our previous film inspired by Dr. Vieira’s previous book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Sword-Sovereignty-Constitutional-Principles-Homeland/dp/0967175941/ref=sr_1_6?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1409002591&amp;sr=1-6&amp;keywords=edwin+vieira" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.amazon.com/Sword-Sovereignty-Constitutional-Principles-Homeland/dp/0967175941/ref=sr_1_6?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1409002591&amp;sr=1-6&amp;keywords=edwin+vieira', 'THE SWORD AND SOVEREIGNTY');" target="_blank">THE SWORD AND SOVEREIGNTY</a>.  MOLON LABE explains what the Militia System is and how it fits into principles set forth in the <em>Second Amendment. </em>MIDNIGHT RIDE explains what could happen if some catastrophe — like a meltdown of the Federal Reserve System — occurred and politicians attempted to call for martial law.  What are the rules?  What does the U.S. Constitution say about the matter?  What would YOU do?  If one does not know the answers to these questions, this film and the book will shed some light on a subject that no one wants to confront — but everyone has in the back of their minds.</p>
<p>Given the events of the day, it’s easy to see that this subject is quite topical and this film will hopefully be completed sooner, rather than later.</p>
<p>In summary, here’s what has been completed on MIDNIGHT RIDE:  Three more re-writes of the narration script, the budget, various interviews, the official website, the 1-sheet and trailer.</p>
<p>You can monitor the progress of MIDNIGHT RIDE at the following URLs:</p>
<p>The latest draft of the narration script is always at <a href="http://www.MidnightRide.us/mr_script.pdf" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'download', 'http://www.MidnightRide.us/mr_script.pdf');" target="_blank">http://www.MidnightRide.us/mr_script.pdf</a></p>
<p>The production-marketing budget is at <a href="http://www.MidnightRide.us/mr_budget.pdf" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'download', 'http://www.MidnightRide.us/mr_budget.pdf');" target="_blank">http://www.MidnightRide.us/mr_budget.pdf</a></p>
<p>You can see the new HTML and FLASH websites and 1-sheet at <a href="http://www.MidnightRide.us" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.MidnightRide.us', 'http://www.MidnightRide.us');" target="_blank">http://www.MidnightRide.us</a></p>

<p>If your time is limited, please, at least watch the trailer.</p>
<p>In order for MIDNIGHT RIDE to maintain continuity with MOLON LABE, we hope to interview many of the same experts that appeared in MOLON LABE, however we will also attempt to bring new experts into the production.  These we will continue to announce as they materialize.</p>
<p>If you have personal connections to any celebrities or “name” experts that you feel are qualified to discuss the subject matters covered in this film, please feel free to contact me or one of our producers with contact and referral information.  We are happy to acknowledge your efforts as an Associate Producer if you so desire.</p>
<p>As you may have guessed, the production of motion pictures is somewhat capital-intensive.  Therefore we have to ask that you please donate what you can for the production-marketing of MIDNIGHT RIDE.  You can do this by going to <a href="http://www.MidnightRide.us/donate" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.MidnightRide.us/donate', 'http://www.MidnightRide.us/donate');" target="_blank">http://www.MidnightRide.us/donate</a> We will accord Producer, Executive Producer, Associate Producer or Production Associate screen credits on the completed movie as acknowledgement for various donation levels.  Early donors will receive preferential screen credits.  Donations are cumulative as far as screen credits.</p>
<p>Lastly, please forward this Progress Report to your family, friends and associates.  Feel free to excerpt these Progress Reports — along with the donation URL — and send them to your organization’s mailing list, post them on your website or in your publications and on your blog and Facebook pages.</p>
<p>Thank you for all you have done to make our previous <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLVCYZiC20h35tqdAc78DYKeMIwHrFSwwb" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLVCYZiC20h35tqdAc78DYKeMIwHrFSwwb', 'six films');" target="_blank">six films</a> possible.  And thank you in advance for any help you can grant for this current production.  Our research, and these films, proceed on the backs of concerned men and women who know we have the greatest country in history, but who seek to build an even “more perfect union”.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p>P.S. I would like to again thank executive producers, Brian Rockey and Phyllis Sorenson for their generous support of MIDNIGHT RIDE. Also, I would like to thank Elias Alias of OATH KEEPERS, a fountain of energy and creativity, for his guidance and support. This movie could not be made without patriots like you. Thank you all.</p>

<p><strong>End James Jaeger’s most recent progress report on the movie Midnight Ride.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">–</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="../wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Paul-Revere.jpg"><img alt="Paul-Revere" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5123" height="447" src="../wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Paul-Revere.jpg" width="622"/></a></p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Saddle Up!</strong></h2>
<p><strong><br/>
</strong></p>
<p>I would like to add just a wee bit to that update from James. I am speaking to all Oath Keepers and patriot friends here. We do encourage you to contribute to the film’s production costs. This movie project is being supported by Oath Keepers but only with our work. Oath Keepers is not using any Oath Keepers funds to do so.  Oath Keepers’ general funds are strictly used for our outreach programs. We will not spend our general funds on this project. My task is to appeal to our readership and inspire *<em>you</em>* to want to send your support directly to James Jaeger’s studio.  For all Oath Keepers who, like me, find that times are hard when it comes to stretching one’s dollars to pay the power bill and buy groceries, there is an equally important work you can volunteer to do in support of this project — that is to use your email lists to share the news about this upcoming film and ask your friends to also pass the word. That is known to be a hugely successful grassroots kind of “pay-op activism” and is very effective support. All Oath Keepers can do their part in that without spending money. We need that kind of support. Spread the news about this movie around, yes? Thank you! For after all, this movie is presenting Oath Keepers and our Ten Orders to the world in a very nicely packaged movie documentary on our Constitutional protections and the General government’s disabilities.</p>
<p>As with MOLON LABE, any State chapter which donates $200.00 or more to the production costs of making this film will receive end credits on the movie. I think we had about thirteen or fourteen chapters in the end credits for MOLON LABE, and would love to double that number on this one. Other film credits are available to donors. See James’ breakdown on that at the link above.</p>
<p>Thank you each and all for getting into the project however you can. When whatever fate has in store for this Republic materializes, if it is not good for our kind of people, it will be important that the seeds of a full understanding of the spirit and intent of our Constitution be preserved in the hands of the people on the land.  This movie will be distributed to thousands of people. And as with MOLON LABE! and the other Constitutional documentaries James has made, it will end up on the Internet for free downloading. It is a psy-op, a teaching tool, a very tasteful presentation of the hard facts of the U.S. Constitution’s restraints on the General government, and the Constitutional answer to any rogue politician calling for “martial law”.</p>
<p>This film will help preserve the seeds of liberty, shall help make sure that freedom shall not perish even when worldly powers seek to stamp it out. The two sister films, MOLON LABE and Midnight Ride, will justify in clear language and through the voices of our era’s good men and women of conscience the culture of America which is now under siege.  The infrastructure of a militarized police-state is now in place and under government control in WDC. The NSA’s surveillance state is up and running. The Executive no longer feels any need for the Legislative or Judicial. The nation is in crisis mode on many fronts. Educating the people about their rights under the Constitution is the finest work we can offer. Let’s all help James Jaeger get this one done quickly. I’ll have more good news for you very soon. Saddle up!</p>
<p>Salute!</p>
<p>Elias Alias, editor for Oath Keepers</p>

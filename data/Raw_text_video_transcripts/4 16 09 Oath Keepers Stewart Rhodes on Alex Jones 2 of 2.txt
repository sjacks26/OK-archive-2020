## Alex Jones, Stewart Rhodes. Rhodes is on the phone, no video of him, just a still picture when he talks

## Video starts mid-sentence from Jones. I think they’re talking about the DHS report about RWX. Also about the meeting on the Lexington Green on April 19 to renew oaths.

SR: They’re trying to purge and limit speech. Want vets to be worried they’ll be labeled terrorists. I’m starting to think that they think anyone who took an oath to defend the Constitution is a threat. This is they’re preemptive way of labeling returning vets as crazy and potential terrorist threats, as all McVeighs. The way to fight this is to shine light on it, you shine light on cockroaches and they scurry away. (0:00:46.1)

AJ: Janet Napolitano doesn’t apologize for these reports.

SR: We (constitutionalists) are a possible threat, quite frankly. We’re not a threat to the American people, we’re not terrorists, but we are a threat to their attempt to destroy the American republic.

AJ: We have all these legal principles and documents backing us up (including organic law). Foreign bankers usurping through the executive branch, both parties. They’re violating our rights and freedoms. (0:02:07.5) “We are in the right of the Declaration of Independence to arrest all these people through the grand juries, through indictments. So they’ve got to declare us the enemy and us the terrorists because they are the ones terrorizing our liberty” (0:02:19.5). “They know if the people ever get control of this country again, they’re going to prison.” “They plan a hot revolution in this country of power and tyranny. They are the revolutionaries, we are the restorationists. We just want our Bill of Rights and Constitution and liberty, not their old-time religion of tyranny.” (0:03:02.4) 

SR: They’re the assaulters on the Constitution and the American republic, and we’re the defenders. We’re the people’s protectors. It’s imperative that military and police stand up in big enough numbers that you can’t dismiss them as lone crazies.

AJ: It takes a lot of courage for current military to come and swear your oath.

SR: One navy officer said he had nothing to fear because all he’s doing is reaffirming his obligation.

AJ: That shows how close it is to midnight that it’s considered radical for people to stand up and say I won’t put Americans in camps. (0:04:13.1)

SR: You quote Jefferson and John Adams and Sam Adams and they consider you a threat. And we are a threat to their plans. We’re not gonna let them do it. [laughter] So I guess in some ways their report is accurate, but not the way they spin it, that we’re gonna kill people and blow up babies, that we’re racist.

AJ: Oh yeah, that’s the worst part. We don’t care about his race, we care about his gun policies. (0:05:05.3) We are at a historic crossroads. I can see it in their eyes, they’re scared, they’ve put their criminal actions into motion. We are gonna kick the New World Order’s butt.

SR: They thought we would be an easy victim. [laughter] We’re gonna have a Navy Seal Captain administer the oath unless Judge Napolitano wants to come administer the oath. (0:05:52.9). I can’t think of a more consistent judge.

AJ: I promised to cover the angles of this new report demonizing Christians and gun owners.

SR: Everyone’s welcome. It’d be great to have a judge like that. This isn’t the first time this has happened, there’s historical precedent for renewing your oath. Militia in 1798 stood on the Green and renewed their oath. They wrote to John Adams, president at the time, who wrote back applauding them for doing so. We’re gonna use that quote.

AJ: Yeah, but you’re talking about Founding Fathers, that’s al-Qaeda (0:07:17.8), that’s just really radical stuff. 

AJ: I want to make sure this doesn’t turn into riots and a shooting war. Watching CNN try to start physical fights. They’re trying to make it a left-right fight, to divide and conquer. The left was trying to make this a fight, but they’re failing. Every month, more people wake up to the two-puppet system (0:08:33.6).

SR: Their attack on vets is an indication of their fear. We’re not Germany, our oath is not to the fuhrer. They can’t demonize who people who are just gonna stand by the Constitution. We’re not Russian or Chinese peasants either. “This is America. We have a heritage of defeating any tyrant that tries to put his boot on the back of our neck, I don’t care if it’s a left boot or a right boot.” (0:09:06.4) That’s why we’re meeting on the Green. We need boots on the ground, on the Green. It’s a very important stand, statement. We’re gonna send our declaration of orders [we will not obey?] to the White House, to Congress, to every state legislature. We’re gonna sign our names and say here we are.

AJ: I can’t wait to see the video my guys shoot up there. I’ll give Judge Napolitano your number.

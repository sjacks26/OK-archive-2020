## LaVoy Finicum; Jason Van Tatenhove

JVT: I’m here at the Malheur Refuge with the Citizens for Constitutional Freedom. As you know, I’ve interviewed LF before. LF has taken a stand with BLM at his own ranch, and now I’m pleased to see that he’s here amongst our fellow patriots taking a stand against the BLM.

JF: Great to meet you in person.

JVT: That’s what’s great about these operations. You build relationships online (0:00:58.8) and then, when it’s time to do real work, the real people get out there and it’s good to meet those people when you can. Tell us why you’re here. What made you decide to leave your ranch, come out here to outside of Burns, and do what you do?

JF: I hadn’t planned on being on here. Let’s be clear what brought me here: it’s the atrocities perpetrated on the Hammond family. He and his son, he’s 75 years old, are being thrown into prison a second time for the same offense, for a fire of 140 acres of brush, which happened 11 years ago.

JVT: You’re a rancher in Arizona, near the Bundy Ranch. I’m in cow country in Montana. These types of burns happen on a weekly basis. Whether it’s forest burns or ranchland.

JF: Prescribed burns have always been part of land management. The federal government does it all the time. Private individuals do it on private land, with these big areas. It helps burn off unproductive brush, that there’s no feed to drive nutrients back into the soil, so there’s more feed for wildlife and cattle (0:02:35.8)

JVT: This case is a little different than we saw with the Bundys, where you had private land. There was a court case. They were found guilty by a jury of their peers, supposedly. Now there’s some real questions with that. (0:02:54.5) I wanna address that.

JF: I don’t think it was a jury. I think it was just a court ruling, just a judge. Not a jury of their peers.

JVT: So they were found guilty, but there are serious questions around that. There’s evidence that the prosecution…

JF: Oh, you’re referring to the Hammonds, I thought you were referring to Cliven. It was a jury of their peers, they were found guilty. And yes there are some real questions coming to light where this needs to be looked at. That’s part of the redress of grievances. That’s where Ammon has taken an exhaustive, trying to get the officials to, the judges, the county commissioners, to reconvene just an evidentiary hearing, to look at these new things that have come to light (0:03:53.5). Petitions with tens of thousands of names on them. They’ve completely ignored that large of a response just to say, they’re all crazies. That is what the judge said. People in this area had concerns and signed the petition, they’re just crazies.

JVT: That’s how they try to label the entire movement (0:04:18.1). That’s far from the case. Everybody involved seems to be very level-headed, very calm, very intelligent people. Ammon has done an incredibly exhaustive study, you can check it out on bundyranch.blogspot. Please check that out, it’s an important part of this. (0:04:45.7) A lot of people are concerned that you people have occupied these buildings. At first when I heard about it, I thought it may not have been the wisest decision, with the timing of what’s happening with gun legislation with Obama, it seems gift-wrapped. But being here, seeing the people here and the atmosphere, my mind is changing a bit. It feels more like the occupation of a dean’s office, something you see on a campus. (0:05:19.5) How many people in the administration now have been part of that sort of thing?

JF: I think a few might have, don’t know specifically.

JVT: Yes, there are guns here. The 2A is being exercised. But as a whole, the Liberty Movement, from Bundy Ranch on. You’ll remember at Bundy Ranch, it started without guns.

JF: Exactly (0:05:45.1). I never had one there

JVT: You had Ammon lifting his shirt, saying hey guys I left my guns at home, I don’t have a pocketknife. That was the day they sent the attack dogs on him.

JF: And tazed him.

JVT: The next day, the guns came out, and the dynamic changed. People were treated with respect, like human beings.

JF: There’s an old saying (0:06:07.8) I thought it came from the old country of France. It says one sword tends to keep another sword in its sheath. That’s exactly where the guns should be. We should all be neighborly, kind, and friendly.

JVT: I want to point out, I’ve been to every operation that OK has been a part of. This is not an OK operation, but it’s an important part of the Liberty Movement, which is why I’m here. Every operation I’ve been to, not one bullet has flown, not one drop of blood has spilled. Every operation has been done with grown men and women acting responsibly. (0:06:46.2)

JF: I hope it continues to be that way. Regardless, we stand for freedom. We stand peacefully but firmly. 

JVT: Tell us about the decision making process for the occupation. 

JF: For myself, (0:07:06.8) I came here because of atrocities to the Hammond family. I was gonna put flowers on their doorstep then go home. As I was traveling up here, Cliven called to check on me, see how I was doing with my own issues with the BLM. I told him I was gonna go up to support the Hammonds, he suggested we get some carpooling. His son Ryan met me, we drove up together. We expected to be back the next day. Ryan had one change of clothes. I had a couple changes. (0:07:45.8) We found out just prior to the march. We were pulled into a meeting an hour before the march, where Ammon listed all the avenues that he had exhausted over time to get redress for the Hammonds. How they had been flatly ignored, not responded to. (0:08:18.0) Then he said, if we allow this to stand, this will be the new normal for American citizens. It’s time to do more than allow these things to happen, to allow good people to be terrorized, now imprisoned. This is unacceptable. So he said we need to act. At that point, he laid out the plan to come here and occupy.

JF: So just before the march, we pulled into Burns, me and Ryan. So he called us into a meeting with locals, and a few people who came to support. He again laid out his case, every avenue that had been ignored or refused. He said we cannot allow this to stand. (0:09:32.2) He said I feel in my heart that we should occupy this Malheur Wildlife Refuge. I said, Ammon, are you telling me that all these years we’ve been trying to draw defensive line, we keep getting pressed here and here and losing ground. Are you now saying this is a peaceful step forward to reclaim? He said yes I am. He said who will go with me? There was actually a county deputy in the room. Several people in the room said we appreciate what you’re doing but this is one bridge too far for us (0:10:16.4) and they excused themselves. At one point, Ammon did the support march, and a handful of us, 4 or 5 vehicles, drove out here. You do a lot of thinking driving out here. Have you heard the term crossing the Rubicon? It means when Caesar crossed the Rubicon, there’s no turning back (0:11:01.3). Anyway, I’m driving out, the last vehicle, saying I haven’t crossed the Rubicon yet, but I’m getting close. I said, I’m with you Ammon. We actually prayed before we left. But it’s 45 minutes or an hour out to here, a lot of time to think about things. There’s no going back. As I’m driving out, (0:11:38.2) it’s just snow and flat, and the road is kind of raised and there’s fence posts on both sides. Up ahead, there’s a big beautiful bald eagle, just sitting there watching us. As we go by, he lifts off and flies, and I go, it’s okay, this is for freedom. Freedom is worth everything.

JVT: It’s amazing you say that story. As we were in convoy headed here yesterday, I was embedded with III%ers. As we were driving up, literally the same thing happened. We mentioned it on the radio. There’s this bald eagle, it seems to be a good sign for freedom. (0:12:27.4)

LF: This is deeply personal and spiritual to me. I believe that God intends for all his children to live free. There’s no way that what has happened to the Hammonds is freedom. The reason it’s happened is that we have allowed such a centralization of power without accountability. If it had not been for that, I wouldn’t be here in the newly renamed Harney County Resource Center. (0:13:06.0) We have laid everything on the line. All that we have is in jeopardy, and that’s okay. It doesn’t matter. What matters is that you try to do what’s right, and let the chips fall where they may. 

JVT: Anything else you want to add before you go?

JF: Sometimes this militia gets a bad rap. They came out with tact’ed out stuff, but they travel that way (0:13:41.0), in a protective detail. That’s understandable. But the media loves to eat it up. That’s who they are. From a distance, we’ve felt their support saying to the federal government, just leave them alone, they’re not hurting anybody. Their 35 miles from the nearest place, they’re not threatening anybody. I understood when the media person told me that they were going to unoccupy the school and let the kids go back, the federal agents that occupied the school and made a fortress out of it. They’re the ones that instilled fear in the community, setting up an armed camp and then lying to us, oh we had to close it down because the families were scared. They closed it to use it as a staging area for military operations. (0:14:37.0) What liars. There’s no need to escalate things like this.

JVT: It’s illegal for you and me to lie to them, but there’s no laws against them doing it.

JF: There’s a double standard. It’s time that the federal government is held to, we should be equal under the law. For example, the Hammonds set a back fire to save more land, to stop another fire.

JVT: And they actually did save land.

JF: And they’re charged as terrorists and go to prison twice. (0:15:08.3) Where I’m from, there’s the Warren Fire, the last big controlled fire by the federal government, it got out of hand and burned thousands of prime timber. Did anybody go to jail? Did anybody lose their job?

JVT: No

JF: We live under two standards. We are not equal under the law. We have the federal class that protects their own, then we have us the lower the class.

JVT: Sure and the state employees too. You’re either part of the system or you’re not.

JF: And where does the privileged class receive their money from? (0:15:54.2) From the working class.

JVT: It’s a false economy.

JF: It is, and we all understand that. This is such an egregious example, how could we have done anything else? We, Ammon exhausted every avenue, there was no other recourse to take but to peacefully stand up and take this to make a statement to try to get redress for Hammonds and for other purposes of freedom. (0:16:24.2)

JVT: Folks, we talk a lot about the background to this story and all the research. I want to challenge all of you to, I’m going to include references to information that backs up everything that we say. I want you to read it and understand the backstory that we’re talking about. Really across the board in these western states, with these egregious happenings, whether it’s a guy in Montana or Wyoming putting a pond in his backyard and being prosecuted as a terrorist, to the Hammonds to the Bundys. The info is there folks. We need to bone up on that and be able to speak intelligently about it. Take the time to read up. (0:17:23.5)

JF: I want to put out a thank you to the militia that came down to support us. They make us feel safe, they don’t have to be on site. We feel their support. To all the Americans that have prayed for us, even if they don’t agree or understand, we have felt their prayers. We’ve felt their support. We’re not stopping, we won’t back down. As Ammon said, we will leave not a minute too soon.

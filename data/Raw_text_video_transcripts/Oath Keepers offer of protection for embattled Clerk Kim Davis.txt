SR: I’m on the phone with Sheriff Denny Peyman from Kentucky, and also Jon Karriman, our leader from southern Missouri who is now in Kentucky, too. Also is Allen Larderi, West Virginia OK leader in the Appalachian Mountain area. JK and DP, give us an update of what’s going on.

JK: We were out today at the detention center in Grayson, about 1455 hours CST, they let Ms. Davis come out. She had her attorney, Matt Staver, with her, her husband Joe, and Mike Huckabee. I understand Cruz was somewhere else in the crowd. They weren’t releasing a lot as far as what she agreed to. But they did finally capitulate and let her out. That’s about it as far as what they’ve released so far.

DP: That’s about what I’ve heard as well.

SR: DP, you and I were talking earlier and you were saying that (0:01:27.9) you think the heat was coming down, so they’re kind of backpedaling. Is that still how you feel?

DP: I think everyone’s gonna back off. It’s still important that we have a presence there, just like you say about offer of protection, talking with her attorney, they know we’re available now. I heard the conversation with the secretary when you spoke to the attorney’s secretary. I still think it’s important that our presence be known. It’s not an issue of marriage, it’s not an issue of many of the things they’re trying to make the issue. The issue is still that a judge took an elected official, a citizen of the US, and detained her without cause, without paperwork, without due process. That’s the situation. While everyone else is painting the picture in another way, the true picture is just what I said. He needs to know that he’s not out of the woods (0:02:36.1) just because they let her out. He’s still going to be held accountable. I think our presence there, over a couple of days, meeting with her, do a rotation of someone that could see what they’re comfortable with, if they want somebody close by, just see what their needs are and serve their needs.

SR: Absolutely. If you and Jon could make that offer, offer her a close protection team, if she wants it we’ll provide it. Regardless, people should consider her under our protection. We’ll make sure our people keep a close eye on the situation and we’re gonna have boots on the ground on overwatch regardless. Like you said, this judge needs to understand that he’s not going to be able to go grab this lady whenever he feels like it. There’s no charge, there’s no grand jury indictment, there’s no jury trial. There’s not even a law that he cited. He just grabbed her up and said until you bend to my will, I’m going to keep you in jail. That’s not his prerogative. We don’t live under an imperial judiciary any more than we live under an imperial presidency. This is the kind of problem we’re in. We have both the executive branch and now the judicial branch claiming that kind of authority, just to point a finger at somebody and have them whisked away without going through the constitutional process. They have to charge you, then have a grand jury indict you before they can even charge you, then they gotta have a jury trial of your peers before they can judge you guilty and put you in jail. This judge bypassed the entire process. (0:04:17.6) That’s where our focus is, it’s not, like you said, it’s not on the subject matter, whether you think gay marriage is appropriate. It’s about the judge’s actions. That’s where the focus is going to stay. If you two don’t mind coordinating on the ground, with other OK, just make that offer of protection for her.

DP: Are you and Jason still planning on coming in? (0:05:08.6)

SR: Yes. I’ll be there tomorrow night. Jason will be landing Thursday. Tell the guys I’ll be in tomorrow night. Here’s the thing, from what I’ve read, the judge only let her out, I think the pressure had something to do with it, but he’s saying he let her out because her subordinates, her deputy clerks, are issuing licenses after he ordered them to do it under the same threat. Now that she’s out of jail, if she goes to reassert her authority over her own office, her employees, she’s liable to be grabbed up again by the same judge. As far as we’re concerned, this isn’t over. Like you said, this judge needs to be put on notice that his behavior isn’t going to be accepted. We’ll be there to stop it, to intercede ourselves if we have to. If the sheriff who should be interceding isn’t gonna do his job, and if the governor isn’t going to do the governor’s job of interceding, we’ll do it. (0:06:10.7)

## There’s something strange about SR’s idea of authority. Is Kim Davis allowed to assert authority over subordinates because she is local? Why isn’t the governor’s not interceding a valid exercise of the governor’s authority? Is it because SR thinks the governor is wrong? In that case, is legitimate authority tied to doing the right thing? If so, then SR’s logical should be able to say that Davis abdicated her authority when she didn’t do what her office demanded of her.
## There’s an inconsistency here that I haven’t figured out yet. It might come down to SR and OK using the language of legitimate authority and local supremacy as strategic framing to provide cover so they don’t have to say they are taking someone’s side because they agree with them on policy.
## Is there something similar here with the role of the sheriff? SR and others say from time to time that sheriffs need to step up and assert their authority over the FBI or BLM or whoever. But what if the sheriff asserts his authority to let the FBI or BLM have jurisdiction and enforce federal law? What if the sheriff isn’t on the side lines, but is on the side of the FBI? That sheriff is still asserting local authority (to some extent), but would be using that local authority to legitimize federal authority, too, which OK wouldn’t support (I assume).

DP: Maybe educating the sheriff about what he can do. Maybe he doesn’t realize that, a lot of sheriffs haven’t been educated, they don’t want to step out and make a mistake like that. He wouldn’t be making a mistake, basically just doing his job. Maybe we can get a meeting with the sheriff and educate him as well.

JK: That’s an excellent idea

SR: (0:06:39.7) That’s a great thing, please do that. It’s great that you were an experienced Kentucky sheriff who hopefully can lead him to the right path. Please do so. While we’re at it, our guys are already there and more coming. Once again, if we have to, we’ll lead by example. Certainly, we would ask the sheriff to do his job and step up. Then we can step back out.

DP: The sheriff can control this whole situation. The next time the federal marshals walk in, he can put them right back out the door. He needs to know that.

JK: Therein lies the problem. The federal government, if any of their actors intervene in any situation, everybody rolls over and does what they’re told. It is a matter of education. Being able to get through to them is going to be key here. If they’ll just listen and understand that they have rights and responsibilities and that part of those responsibilities are not to cave in or roll over at the first sign of some type of intervention from what they believe to be on high.

SR: (0:07:53.9) The perception in a lot of police circles is that once the feds step in, the locals wash their hands of it, they back away and give automatic deference.

JK: Yes

SR: DP, have you seen any indication that the sheriffs in Kentucky on this issue are starting to stand up and pay attention? Is there any statement made by the sheriff’s association?

DP: I’ve dealt with the sheriff’s association here, what I found is that they’re a bunch of weak individuals that are basically, they’re not going to disrupt, rock the boat any. I actually had no support from the sheriff’s association in efforts I’d made to do what was right, to fight corruption, even part of the gun control, to stand up for my county. When we did the resolution in Las Vegas, I made sure every one of our sheriffs in the state got a copy of that and I got no response back.

SR: (0:08:54.4) The CSPOA resolution on gun confiscation?

DP: Yeah, that was the same resolution we took to DC last year, to the Press Club there. We passed that out to all the senators and representatives. Our association here would not stand behind that.

SR: It’s too bad to hear that. When you were in office there, you actually arrested a corrupt judge, is that right?

DP: Yeah. I had a federal judge take all the evidence I had and he sealed it.

SR: So in other words, you can’t even expose the corruption. They declined to prosecute, even after you arrested the judge. And they concealed his crimes.

DP: They basically just protect each other. I exposed stuff that would take a senator down. They really got nervous then, about allowing anything.

SR: (0:10:05.9) So with that background, you don’t hold a lot of faith in the judicial system when it comes to respecting the rights of any American, I would imagine.

DP: I’ve dealt with it a long time. It’s not looking good in Kentucky, I can’t speak for everywhere. They all take care of each other. I turned my stuff in on a Tuesday night and Wednesday morning everything was sealed. So I knew they weren’t going to expose anything, that all the charges I had, frivolous at that point. The sheriff’s need to understand what their power is. I’ve had the IRS come into the county wanting to seize property and stuff, and I just tell them, you come back without a piece of paper I’m going to put you in jail. There was nothing seized by the IRS, accounts, property, while I was sheriff.

SR: (0:10:59.9) It’s unfortunate that so many sheriffs either don’t understand their authority and responsibility or they just don’t have the backbone to do it. Which do you think it is in Kentucky, ignorance or lack of backbone?

DP: Both. When you have an IRS person show up wanting to seize property, if anyone asks for paperwork, something signed by a judge, they don’t have anything. I’ve worked with them enough to know, they sat right across my desk and I told them that if I caught them at the bank or sending mail to citizens without a judge’s signature, that I’d put them in jail. It stopped. I’m sure it will start again. (0:11:41.5)

SR: If you were the sheriff in the county where Kim Davis was taken up by this judge’s order, what would you have done?

DP: (0:11:50.1) First, they wouldn’t have picked her up. Without any paperwork, they have no reason to pick her up. A judge had better sign something and send it to my office, or there’s nothing gonna happen.

SR: Well he sent out an order finding her in contempt and ordering the marshals to arrest her. But there’s no citation to a criminal law that she violated, there’s no grand jury indictment, it’s just his will.

DP: It’s basically, I think he had his pride hurt because she wouldn’t comply.

SR: So he was gonna show her his power. This is exactly the kind of thing that our Founding Fathers dealt with, with the magistrates and officers of the Crown, who wanted to run roughshod over the rights of the colonists without a jury indictment, without any of that. Same thing. They just want to show their power, show you who’s boss. Allen, you put a video out a couple days ago. We did a board conference call, Sheriff Peyman is on our BoD, on Saturday night. We brought you and your crew from WV in. We decided, as you articulated, if she hadn’t been in custody, we would have offered to protect her. With her in custody, our plan was to go picket outside the judge’s house. Now they’ve let her go, temporarily at least, are your guys ready to go down there and pull security?

AL: (0:13:22.0) Absolutely. As DP said, we have zero confidence in what’s going on now. When we have overreach of government, it is the responsibility of individual citizens to be responsible for this country, to pretty much go in there. We plan on supporting him in whatever we need to do to support his operations in his AO. However he needs us, we’re there.

SR: Well gentlemen, I’ll see you in Kentucky. I think it’s important like AL said, DP is the local man, he’s the guy in charge. If you can make the offer to Ms. Davis and her family, let her know that we’re more than happy to provide whatever security she requires to make sure that she’s not subject to arbitrary arrest and imprisonment just because some judge decides he can do it and he’s going to exercise his power. If you can do that on our behalf, that’d be excellent.

DP: Do you want me to make that offer tomorrow or should I wait until Thursday, you can go with me? (0:14:36.2)

SR: Make it tomorrow. I don’t need to be there. I know JK is there now. If you two could work together, make the offer, the sooner the better, so she’s protected. I’ll see you Thursday morning. The most important thing is for Ms Davis and her supporters to know that we stand with them on that issue. It’s not about whether we approve gay marriage. People need to understand this. We need to start looking past whether we like someone’s opinion and look towards the Constitution. Is it right or wrong for a judge to exercise this kind of power? We think it’s wrong. It doesn’t matter why he’s doing it, it’s wrong to do it. We stand in defense of her right to a grand jury indictment and her right to jury trial.

## Video starts with Barbie from Patriot Information Hotline. Other speakers: Fernando; Rob (team leader from Camp Lonestar)

B: I’m here with Fernando, he lives down by the border, we’re gonna ask him a couple of questions. How do you like living down here?

F: I love it. I wouldn’t live anywhere else, this is my home.

B: What is going on down here?

F: We have a situation where they built a wall (0:00:30.3) at the end of our street. That’s not keeping anything out. In fact, the gate stays open day and night. It’s not doing anything, keeping people out of this area. It’s a popular area for people to cross. For reason the gate is open all the time. We have an influx of people who go through here (0:00:58.4). People who try to hide in the area end up tearing down fences, trying to hide in barns. 2 have tried to get in my home when people were sleeping inside. That’s what we have to deal with on a daily basis. (0:01:17.0) People don’t know, unless they’re actually living down here, they don’t hear about this. The media doesn’t.

B: How good is the response time if somebody breaks into your house and you call for help? (0:01:33.6)

F: This area falls under county, so the responders would have to be sheriff’s department. Most of the time, there might be only 1 unit or 2, for the whole county. So 30, 45 minutes. Sometimes, you call them and they happen to be nearby and they show up within 10, 15 minutes. 

B: So it takes them 45 minutes sometimes (0:02:12.6). What is the number one concern with that fence? Is it that it’s not locked? Even if it is locked, can they climb over it?

F: Yeah, they’ll climb over it. If you go down the fence, you can see the imprints of their shoes going over the top.

B: I was looking at it, it looks like the top has caps. Would they be able to take caps off and maybe put razor wire? (0:02:41.9)

F: The caps might be welded on. But they cross that fence easily, especially since it’s rusted out. That gives them a better grip. They don’t have to climb over it, though. That gate is open most of the time (0:02:56.9).

B: If we could close the gate, they could still climb over. If we put razor wire on the top or electrified the fence, what do you think they’d do?

F: They’d probably find another way in, maybe further down or further up. A fence isn’t going to keep people out. If the laws in place aren’t enforced, from that fence to the river is a little over a mile. Why do they have to wait until that fence to stop them, they can stop them a mile away? (0:03:33.2) By the time they hit that fence, they’re already in. 

B: What do you think is the reason they’re coming in?

F: It used to be to find a better life, to find work. You could see the people coming through wanted to work, to provide for their families. The people now aren’t coming to work. They’re full-grown men, all tattooed. They start destroying our stuff as soon as they hit our neighborhoods. They’re not here for any good.

B: (0:04:08.8) Are the tattoos possibly henna tattoos? Or are they real? 

F: The ones I’ve seen, they’re real. The more popular ones are guys associated with certain gangs over there, they’re coming over here and forming groups, too. This is something we have to deal with on a daily basis. When the people upstate keep saying that nothing like that is going on, I’ll invite them to my home. Come spend the week with me, you’ll see what’s going on.

B: (0:04:55.3) One of the major controversies is the children. How long have you lived here?

F: 5 years.

B: How many children have you seen?

F: None. We’ve had groups of up to 50 come through our neighborhood. There’s no children, it’s all grown men or fully grown women.

B: (0:05:19.5) In the past couple of months, what percentage do you think are actual Mexicans?

F: Right now, we don’t know if they’re just from Mexico. They have that label, OTM, other than Mexican. A lot of them get labeled that. I don’t know where they’re coming from, I just know they’re coming from the south. As far as whether they’re from Mexico or from further, I don’t know, but a lot of these people it seems to me are Mexican. They’re speaking Spanish, the regular Spanish you hear on the border. The ones from further in normally have a different type of Spanish. These groups coming through, they’re just coming in for another agenda. (0:06:20.5)

B: I used to be married to a man from Puerto Rico, I totally understand about the different dialects of Spanish. Have you seen anyone from an Asian country?

F: No, not the groups we’ve had here. (0:06:36.8) There’s been stories of that. While I was working one of my jobs here in 2012, we heard that. But it doesn’t get publicized, because the agents will round these people up fairly quickly. There have been groups of Muslim-based people who crossed through here (0:07:10.1). It’s a known fact that they’ve been in Matamoros for a while. These people get rounded up real quick and get shipped out wherever they send them. They don’t spend even 2 days here.

B: With Border Patrol and ICE and DPS, what are their standing orders about aiming and shooting their weapons? Have you heard rumors?

F: Based on what I’ve found out (0:07:51.7), my sources are there doing their job. I’m a retired firefighter, you take an oath to your department and your bosses are gonna tell you what to do. Even if you think the order is wrong, you have to comply or lose your job. So I understand these people. Their standing orders right now are not to even draw their weapons on these people. If they can, they’re supposed to just move out and leave them alone. That puts my family in danger (0:08:37.3), cause that gate is right at the end of my street. If they leave them alone, they’re gonna end up on my property.

B: How many children do you have in this neighborhood?

F: A lot. Every ranch here has children. I have 3 myself.

B: Have you had any incidences of animals being killed? (0:09:01.6) That was one of the rumors.

F: We’ve lost animals. Most of the time we blame it on disease, but when they’re trying to hide in those stables and the animals are making noise, we haven’t actually seen anybody do it, but you gather conclusions. When you see damaged stable doors, torn fences, that we have to fix ourselves. The wild animals around here can’t do that.

B: If you had the opportunity to talk to at least a million people, what would you tell them about living here? (0:09:41.5)

F: Don’t believe everything in the news. There is danger here, based on how they’re handling the immigration problem. They’re allowing people to come through our neighborhoods. Those of us who live here see what’s happening, we know what’s going on. (0:10:08.1)

B: How do you feel about the American patriots coming down here to help?

F: I’m very grateful to them. I can actually get some sleep now. My older son and I used to take turns at night making sure no one was in here. (0:10:26.3) Now we get to sleep.

B: We have Rob, the leader of Camp Lonestar here.

## Rob is in tactical gear, looks like camo. Has a pair of handcuffs hanging off the front of his vest.

R: Have you been threatened here? How many incidents have you had?

F: Oh yeah. In the 5 years I’ve been here, (0:10:55.4) I’ve had 2 illegals try to gain entry to my house while we’re sleeping inside. My son happened to be outside with the animals, he confronted them, even then they called him names and didn’t want to leave. (0:11:20.9) They stood up to him. Now, we always have our weapons on us. My son had to draw his rifle for them to leave. I had another incident where I was feeding my horses. My 4 year old was on the other side of the stable with other animals. I was out of sight, when I came around the corner, I saw one of the illegals walking towards my son. He got to about 20 feet away and was heading directly to him. When he saw me, he turned around and walked away, but I followed him. When he went into the bush beside my property, another one popped out of the grass. They both confronted me. These guys aren’t afraid. I had to draw my weapon there (0:12:35.4), otherwise they refuse to leave.

B: Have you been threatened by local law enforcement or do you know anyone who has been? Or Border Patrol, to not get involved?

F: No. I haven’t encountered that. Law enforcement agents out here know what’s going on. A lot of these guys live here, too. They know that if they were in the same situation, if they weren’t under the policy of their employer, they’d be doing what we’re doing, protecting their property.

R: Yep, our encounters with Border Patrol have been the same. They’ve been, they’re doing their job as best they can.

F: As best as they’re allowed to do it by their superiors (0:13:40.8).

R: Back to being threatened on your property. Have you had anyone enter your buildings?

F: Oh yeah. One day at noon, my son noticed some people coming in, running from the street into my barn next to my house. This is at noon, plain daylight. It was a group of 30. They wanted a place to hide, I guess Border Patrol was following them from the gate. We came out and told them to leave. They didn’t want to leave (0:14:24.1) so I drew my rifle, started shooting. I hadn’t noticed 20 in my barn, they started running out too. By that time, Border Patrol was here and surrounded them all at the end of the street.

R: (0:14:46.5) With the policies in place, the so-called Catch and Release plan, why do you think they’re running instead of being caught and released again?

F: The ones that want to be caught, they probably heard they get amnesty. The ones that don’t want to get caught, they have another agenda. Like I said, these are full grown men. They look like they’re coming in for another purpose. 

R: (0:15:25.0) I had a chance to speak with a resident from Mexico, asked him about the economy over there. He was telling me that it’s just as easy to find a job in the US as Mexico. The reason we have illegals coming is that they don’t want to work, and with the policies and freebies in this country, they’re coming to take advantage. Do you think he’s correct about that?

F: Oh yeah, we see it every day. There are even advertisements in the paper, if you’re a Mexican national, they’ll help you find a home real cheap. Our own people can’t even get financing (0:16:08.7).

R: That’s in the newspaper here?

F: You can see it in the Sunday paper, in the classifieds. They recruit Mexican nationals for all times of financing and homes and everything. If they already have family on this side, they give them all kinds of benefits, they give them free medical. Who would want that? I’m a retired firefighter, disabled, since I got injured on the job in 2000. I don’t get any benefits. Social Security judges keep saying I’m not disabled enough. I have my wheelchair that I have to use for long walks (0:16:55.0), my legs give out. I don’t know what they considered disabled enough, but other folks at hearings just have a diabetic condition and they get it. I don’t understand how they do it. A lot of people coming from Mexico, they get their permits or whatever, and right away apply for benefits, and they do get them.

R: (0:17:28.8) Seeing the amount of people and kind of people coming here, do you think the government has an agenda to want them here?

F: It feels that way. Somebody’s got a reason to let them in. Someone opened the door by offering amnesty for crossing illegally. I know there’s a lot of Mexican nationals that come legally, who applied for their paperwork and are still waiting for it, who are upset that these people crossing illegally are being offered the same thing they are. I understand, I would be upset to.

B: That wait time is now almost 20 years. (0:18:21.1) We’ve been looking at that, it takes 20 years for someone to cross legally, but if someone crosses illegally and turns themselves in to Border Patrol, they’ve got it all. 

R: How do you feel about the people who try to come here legally? Do you think they’re going to be good people, contributing to the country, versus the ones who come illegally?

F: (0:18:47.2) There’s a track record already. People who come legally, they have a good working record, they have to or they don’t get their paperwork. They do contribute. The percentage of people who get in trouble after starting their paperwork is very low. I know that because I interviewed these people when I worked for pre-trial services. A lot of people from Mexico were upset because they’d already started their paperwork, now they were in trouble, they weren’t gonna be able to continue it. They know what they’ll lose if they get in trouble, so they try to stay out of trouble for the most part (0:19:35.2). I don’t have a problem with people coming here legally. But you’re offering illegals amnesty and automatic citizenship, that I have a problem with. It’s not fair for people coming legally and it’s not fair for us living here.

R: With the open border policy, does that open the door for other countries to come here too, Middle Eastern or Asian?

F: Definitely. As soon as they hear they can walk across without any problem, and they can get benefits and attention, they’re gonna come.

R: Should we see that as a threat to our country? With ISIS and everything?

F: I would. I know you’ve heard supposedly in the past couple days, law enforcement from El Paso to down here, they’re under alert. They found out ISIS has people across the border in Ciudad Juarez and they’re just waiting for something to happen around 9/11. If they already warned law enforcement about that, we should be concerned too (0:20:54.9). The citizens are gonna be the ones who suffer if something happens, they’re gonna attack a place with civilians if they do.

R: Are you aware of any known terrorists being caught?

F: I’ve heard of a few, around 2011, 2012. I’m pretty sure there’s more. But they keep that quiet, they don’t want people down here to know. They don’t want to start a panic. I understand that, but it does happen. 

R: In your community, is the majority Hispanic or white or a different descent?

F: My neighborhood is mostly Hispanic.

R: How do they feel about people entering illegally.

F: When they deal with what I have to deal with, they don’t like it either. A lot of people, they don’t like to get involved. They’re afraid of getting threatened, with the proximity of the border fence. I understand their fear. I look at it as this is my home, if I don’t stand up to these people, they’re gonna wanna take over. I’m not willing to let anyone take over.

R: Would you say this is a race issue or not? (0:22:34.6) We hear on the mainstream media that anybody who doesn’t want the open border or the amnesty is a racist. Do you think that has anything to do with it, or is it just to shut people up?

F: It doesn’t have anything to do with racism. It’s about a way of life and safety for our families. I’ve been speaking up and trying to get a grip on the situation, I’ve lived here 5 years. Some people tell me you just don’t like these illegals, you don’t like Mexicans. I say I’m Hispanic. I might not have family in Mexico, we’re all from Texas. That doesn’t make me a racist. As long as these people aren’t threatening me or my family in our home, I don’t have a problem with them. Do things the right way like every citizen is expected to, follow the law, you should follow the same rule. Do it legally and I don’t have a problem with you.

R: I think most Americans feel that way, it’s said to see it painted.

B: (0:23:59.8) Rob touched on the racism thing. Do you feel any form of racism over what’s going on towards you and your family? Maybe you’re not getting as much help as you should be getting?

F: I wouldn’t say that. I’m disappointed that our government isn’t giving us the help we need, they have another agenda. They decided to offer these people more help than they offer their own citizens. Someone down the line other than the illegals are benefiting from it. That’s what upsets me, we have citizens that don’t have the budget to buy their food or make their payments and they’re not getting the help they need, but they’re giving help to these people coming in illegally. That’s what upsets me. It’s not a racism issue, it’s not just Hispanics that are suffering. Citizens from all different nationalities are suffering.

R: Even the vets (0:25:30.1) waiting to get an appointment with the VA

F: Exactly. Vets fight overseas, come back, can’t even get an appointment, these people crossing the border get all the medical they need.

R: Do you ever feel like whose freedom are they fighting for?

F: Exactly.

R: Our freedom or the ones coming across illegally? I feel that way.

F: I understand vets’ anger.

R: They put their life on the line to fight for our freedom, but the people coming into our country have more freedoms than we do. (0:26:00.5)

F: Their own government has no gratitude for them, has nothing but disrespect. I understand their anger. You just have to look at the facts.

B: This is Barbie down by the border in Texas, I’m not gonna tell you where.

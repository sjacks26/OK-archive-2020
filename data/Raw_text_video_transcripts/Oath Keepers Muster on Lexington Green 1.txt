## Garrett Lear; Stewart Rhodes

GL: I want to welcome a great American who I recently met, flown here from Nevada, the founder and leader of OK, Stewart Rhodes

SR: Good afternoon

Crowd: Hoorah

SR: Hoorah. I’m the founder of OK. I served as a paratrooper in USArmy. You’re an easy crowd. I served like the rest of you, I didn’t do it for a job, I did it because I felt an obligation to serve my country. After that, I went to college, worked in Ron Paul’s office. If you’ll forgive me, I’ll let you know I went to Yale Law School. I hope you won’t hold that against me. One thing I’ll say about Yale Law School, during the presidency of George Bush, there was more respect for the Constitution at Yale than at any other time in its history. I won an award for best paper on the Bill of Rights, because I was outspoken in criticizing what I saw as unconstitutional and dangerous expansions of executive power from the Bush administration. (0:01:59.3) I will always make this clear. OK is a non-partisan association of current serving military, current serving police officers, veterans, and firefights and other emergency personnel. When we say non-partisan, we mean it. I don’t care whether they’re a Democrat or a Republican. If they violate their oath, which they all took to support and defend the Constitution, I will call them on it. (0:02:30.5) And you should too. Everyone here who has taken an oath to support and defend the Constitution, please stand up and raise your right hand. If your oath expired, please put your hand down.

Crowd: laughter

SR: Did your oath expire? No. There is no expiration date on that oath. It’s for life. I have some bad news for you folks. Being an attorney, I did some research. It turns out that you don’t have a right to disobey unlawful orders. You have a duty to disobey unlawful orders. (0:03:37.5) When you swore that oath, no matter how long it’s been, that is where you lost the option to not stand, to duck out and hide, or be afraid to speak out. That’s where your choice was made. All you have left to do is your duty. (0:04:19.9)

SR: We stress in OK military, current serving, and law enforcement for a reason. We know that if the day should come when a full-blown dictatorship will come in this country, or tyranny, from the left or from the right, we know it can only happen if those men, our brothers in arms, go along and comply with unconstitutional orders. That’s why we focus on them. Our mission is simple: it’s to reach out to everyone who has taken an oath, to remind them of that oath and what they swore to defend, and to steel their resolve and buck them up to do what’s right and keep their oath. (0:05:14.5)

SR: Why is the oath to the Constitution? You’ve already had from Dr. Vieira, the constitutional republic put in place by the Constitution is meant to protect your natural rights, rights that predate any government. Where do your rights come from? Do they come from government? They do not. When the men stood here on April 19, 1775, there was no 2A, nor a first, third, fourth, fifth, or any of the rest. They understood that they had natural rights. Even though the British courts had upheld and sustained every abuse of their rights that they had asserted over 15 years of demonstrating, remonstrating, sending petitions, and filing court cases. Every one of those times, the British courts rubber stamped what was done by the king and by Parliament. Did they accept that as the final decision? (0:06:14.3) That was not the end of the argument. The continuation of the argument was right here on this green. They fought back, not just because the Regulars were attempting to disarm them, they fought back in defense of all their other natural rights and all of the procedural protections that Englishmen had fought and died for to give them the ability to preserve those natural rights. Just as we here today benefit from their sacrifice and their struggle. They learned the lessons, the hard lessons they learned are enshrined in the Bill of Rights, which are meant to protect and secure our natural rights. (0:07:03.4)

SR: (0:07:07.9) He was out tilling his field and saw the Regulars coming down the road. To the surprise of his family, he walked into his home and strapped on two dueling pistols he had as prizes from the war against the French. He strapped those on and a French sword, grabbed his musket, and ran out and made war one last time at age 80. He ambushed the Regulars at close range, fired five shots, killed 3 Regulars. In the middle of his reloading, they charged with bayonets, and he fought them sword against bayonet. He was shot in the face, stabbed 16 times, and left for dead. His family went out to gather his body for mourning. When they got there, they realized he was still alive. Not only that, he was trying to reload.

Crowd: laughter, cheers

SR: (0:08:14.1) He was trying to reload and fire a parting shot at that column in the distance. That man lived to be 98, 18 more years. He’s a good example of why, if you ever get in a fight, don’t ever think you’re done just because you get shot once. You keep going. The main point is, though, he understood the reality that once you decide to be the defender of the rights of people, that never expires. He was an Oath Keeper, right? He understood the big picture. When he was asked later why he fought that day, he said he did not want his children and grandchildren to be subjects of a distant king. He wanted them to be free. That’s why he fought. There’s a man who understood the big picture. None of us gets out of here alive. All that counts is whether our children are free.

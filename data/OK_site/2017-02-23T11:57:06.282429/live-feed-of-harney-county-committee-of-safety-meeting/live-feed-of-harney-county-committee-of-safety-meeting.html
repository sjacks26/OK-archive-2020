<p>This is a video of the meeting of the Harney County Committee of Safety, which happened tonight in Burns, OR.  I highly recommend that you watch this:</p>

<p>Here is their website:</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #0000ff;"><em><strong><a href="http://www.hccommitteeofsafety.org/" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.hccommitteeofsafety.org/', 'http://www.hccommitteeofsafety.org/');" style="color: #0000ff; text-decoration: underline;" target="_blank">http://www.hccommitteeofsafety.org/</a></strong></em></span></p>
<p>They started out by reading a letter to Ammon Bundy, asking him to leave (but they have not yet decided on when to give it to him).   And they also read a resolution calling for Federal land holdings to be turned over to the people, which is outstanding.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This is exactly what needs to be done in every county in the West – the people coming together to take the bull by the horns and stand together with THEM in charge.</p>
<div id="post_message_389814">
<p>It was a very good meeting, and it was good to see the community come together and start to stand. Now that we DO support.</p>
<p>The next step needs to be that at least one, but preferably several, ranchers need to turn their cattle out on the public land and then we (all groups, all patriots) can defend them, and most importantly, train and organize them to defend themselves and each other.   And it would be best if the Committee of Safety called for that action and fully supported it (yes, an individual rancher has the right to take that stand on his own, and we can defend him – that is what happened at Bundy Ranch, Sugar Pine Mine, and in Lincoln, MT, where we defended individuals who were willing to stand even if most of their neighbors were not – but it is best for the community to be directly involved and in full support. That is what is needed for a long term, lasting retaking of their land.</p>
</div>
<p>Also, we must train them to defend themselves and each other.  Outside security volunteers can only stay for so long, and if/when there is a national crisis, such volunteers will not be able to go anywhere, since they will be very busy in their own AO.   So, the people of Harney County must be trained and organized to provide their own security.   And that is what we will be happy to do for them so they can be their own security rather than having to rely on “sheepdogs” from outside their county.</p>
<p>In fact, I hereby make this standing offer to the people of Harney County, OR, and to the Harney County Comittee of Safety.   Oath Keepers will train you and help you organize for your own security, so that,  whatever you do, you can provide your own local security teams made up of well trained locals, and those locals can serve as competent, effective local leadership for any outside volunteers you may consent to inviting in to assist you, under the command of local leaders you choose.   That is the best way for you to proceed so you, the locals, call the shots and are in charge, including of any security operations in defense of your rights, as Ammon Bundy himself said is the way this is supposed to go.</p>

David Berry: [00:00:15] My name's David Berry and I'm an Oath Keeper. 

David Berry: [00:00:20] Yes. 

Off-camera 1: [00:00:20] Did you choose to renew your oath again? 

David Berry: [00:00:24] Yes I did choose to renew my oath. That constitution is what got my people out of bondage and learning more information about that. That's that's that's awesome. That's awesome. Cause it's so far in the distant past I have asked my father to remind me about what happened you know with civil rights and things like that. I wasn't there. I was living. But now is a time when we're all living and we're all in this ship together. And if it's taking on water we need to get together and get all the water out there and we can worry about all the differences but we need to get the water out from the water out of the ship. 

David Berry: [00:00:57] So we're not we're not basing our government on one person right. We're basing it off the document. 

Off-camera 2: [00:01:03] That's right. 

David Berry: [00:01:04] You know and that is so great. 

Off-camera 2: [00:01:07] So it's cool that you're on board. 

David Berry: [00:01:09] Yeah I'm I'm I'm ready. I'm ready to go out and talk to some people and waiting for something really. 

Off-camera 2: [00:01:15] I think it brings you know Obama talked about hope hope hope hope. But it's just. It's empty. You know like but when you when you bring oath keepers, the things that we're talking about, to people, I think that's how I think that inspires people because it fills the void. You know people are like what am I going to do. 

David Berry: [00:01:32] Exactly. I saw it I was like Oh I say now I can go I can get involved with these people. You know when I read about the Southern Poverty Law whatever you know because you always gotta do that, look at both sides. You know never just look at one, OK they're saying this but what is it. And I come across that and I saw what they said. And I was like, why would they be saying that maybe because they don't want people of color to go look. you know I hate even saying that because they're human of it but they don't want people of color to go check out something. 

Off-camera 1: [00:02:02] What brought you here to Oath Keepers today? 

David Berry: [00:02:08] I needed something. Or an outlet for all this information. I need an outlet for all this energy. I need an outlet for, You know a way that I could bring people to start learning more. And you know it's a process for me too, to learn about my country and learn about this constitution, that unlike any other country and this is the greatest. and now I know why it's the greatest is because of the Constitution. Without the Constitution we don't have anything but the will of a man. And we all know how men are. we are flawed for whatever reason were completely flawed from the best to the worst. So we can't base our sovereignty on a man and on the mission of a man. That document is going to be the one thing that saves us and it saves this country. So we need to focus in on it. We need to get rid of this [Berry gestures at his skin.] because this is nothing. This is just a covering. You know for for our souls. so we need to just get away from all this and focus on that document because that's the only thing that really truly have to go to for our sanity in this insane environment. And I feel that to the bottom of my core. 

Off-camera 2: [00:03:23] I couldn't have said it better. 

Off-camera 2: [00:03:24] Thank you. I love it and I got somewhere to go. 

[00:03:29] My name is Dave Barry. I'm an Oath Keeper.

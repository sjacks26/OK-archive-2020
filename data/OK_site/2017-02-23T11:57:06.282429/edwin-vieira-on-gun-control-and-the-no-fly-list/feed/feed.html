<content:encoded>“Of course, there is another route by which to secure the benefits of the Second Amendment with respect, not just to individuals’ rights to self-defense (upon which the NRA is fixated), but also to “the security of a free State” for this country as a whole (which is the Amendment’s true goal). Having written more than enough about that elsewhere, I shall refrain from repeating myself here.”  Edwin Vieira, Jr.
<p>Yes Dr. Vieira, the final answer to this treason from within is a decisive and final judgement of the people in the form of the Constitutional Militia, which is now being formed equipped and trained all over these united States of America.  With the express purpose of putting down the sedition and treason perpetrated by the domestic enemies and their followers that you have written about.</p>
<p>I would venture to say that the next list that these obvious un-American creatures use to deprive loyal and law abiding Americans of their 2nd Amendment rights to keep and bear arms will be the long list of returning Iraq and Afghanistan veterans who have already been declared potential domestic terrorist simply by serving their country and returning alive.<br/>
4GW, traitors like these deserves nor will see no quarter.</p>

<content:encoded>As presented above, the NRA is a disappointment in supporting the constitution. The NRA spends millions on media to support the right to defend, hunt, but rare is the mention to defend against our tyranny and totalitarian government. Because that is the case, I have quit any support for them. The NRA writes checks (our money)  to our congress members who in turn are not upholding their constitutional obligation. Now, after many decades of out of government encroachment, the NRA finally runs some media declaring the 2nd amendment is our right to arm our selves to defend our freedom from the tyranny we approach. The NRA will not stand in front of a camera to defend your right to own the same weapons the government intends use on its citizenry.
<p>ΜΟΛΩΝ ΛΑΒΕ</p>
<p>It is our determination to not strike the first blow, but also to not stand mute and allow our loved ones, and all that we believe in and stand for, to be trampled by men who would deprive us of our God-given – or natural, if you will – rights to suit their own ends.</p>

<content:encoded>This article is pretty good but it goes south when Edwin starts citing precedent.  Precedential law is exactly what is killing America. The entire problem is that judges and  lawyers (scourge of the earth) interpret what they want us to see and that’s that. Then the following judges and lawyers can use THAT as law and we have at that time entered into precedential law or law of man which is DIRECTLY tyranny. We have WRITTEN law and THAT takes precedent. Just a couple quick examples: freedom of the press…that does NOT mean they can print what they want, it means they can GO where they want and print ANYTHING they find. It was meant to keep a watchful eye on the government. Freedom of speech…..they say you can be limited and you cannot yell “fire” in a crowded theatre. That’s a total lie and begins to erode the entire document by proxy. You MAY yell fire in a crowded venue and it is totally legal…..however you ARE responsible for what happens if you do and people are hurt. Second amendment is obviously the biggest…..How can they contrive “the RIGHT of the PEOPLE to keep and BEAR arms, shall not be infringed” is WAY beyond me. According to Article VI, ANY law or constitution in any state to the contrary NOTWITHSTANDING. NO law regarding ARMS (not guns) is valid yet because of precedent (lies of man…TYRANNY) we still incarcerate individuals for exercising their Constitutionally guaranteed rights. Precedential law IS tyranny. The real problem is that lawyers have convinced the people that THEIR interpretation of the Constitution is the ONLY one and that is just plain and simply not true in any way shape or form.  Article like this that become too complicated for most are erroneous. The US Constitution was meant to be understood by all and no lawyer would be necessary to exercise our rights. The government has NO authority to prevent the people from keeping and bearing arms OR to place us on no fly lists.  It is no more than a round about gun grab scheme.  First it was veterans then SS recipients that cannot “manage their funds” and now it’s people on the no fly list. Who knows what’s next?  I’ve heard preppers are going to be on the list…. How does a mouse kill an elephant?  One bite at a time baby……Keep up the good work guys…..

<content:encoded>Let us circle the wagons around Mr. Vieira, to forever protect and honor his precision and accuracy when it comes to explaining to the common man or woman what we are facing, Constitutionally speaking!  And Cal, you are a bright shining Star yourself!<br/>
Let all of us copy the words here of Mr. Vieira and Cal’s following comments and USE them in any and every capacity to expand these truths within the minds of others.  Let us share thoughts of the caliber expressed above because within those words of clarity are that which ignites, that which fires up any heart and mind that loves the essence of what America means.<br/>
We do not lack leadership, as you can see from above, but leaders need followers, and good leaders need many many followers.  Igniting the fire within one’s heart, mind and imagination is how and where the followers are born.<br/>
Thank you Elias Alias for all that you do, and especially for offering men like Mr. Vieira and Cal a platform.  I will also recommend Mr. Vieira’s article titled “Short-circuiting the second circuit” which one can find at <a href="http://www.edwinvieira.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.edwinvieira.com</a>.  Another masterpiece.

<content:encoded>Excellent and pertinent article.
<p>“Of course, there is another route by which to secure the benefits of the Second Amendment with respect, not just to individuals’ rights to self-defense (upon which the NRA is fixated), but also to “the security of a free State” for this country as a whole (which is the Amendment’s true goal). Having written more than enough about that elsewhere, I shall refrain from repeating myself here.”</p>
<p>Regarding that other “route”, I do not mind repeating myself (or your words) because due to propaganda, subliminals, “dumbing down” education, and drugging a lot of the American people need a lot of repetition for it to sink in and make sense.</p>
<p>The other constitutionally required route is the Militia, made up of “We the people…” trained to arms and combat as congress requires the military to be trained.</p>
<p>No, the Militia is NOT any governmental agency such as the National Guard.  Dr. Vieira lists why not in many places and within his books (which I highly recommend reading).</p>
<p>So who is the “organized” Militia?  That would be veterans that KEEP their Oath to the US Constitution.  </p>
<p>Why veterans? They are no longer in the employ of those that serve within our government, they are trained as the congress requires the military to be trained.  They can train others (when those who have been charged with that duty is remiss in their constitutionally required obligations to the Militias) the American people so that they can become the organized Militia and then also assist in defending our nation from those Domestic enemies and foreign ones, replacing those who serve within our governments with people who will keep their Oaths, and follow the US Constitution.  </p>
<p>(My opinion) This is why Vets are under attack from those who serve within our governments – state and general – because they have the full and complete backing of the US Constitution as long as what they do to restore the US Constitution is in Pursuance thereof, and that makes them the biggest danger to those that serve within our governments. Because what they would do to stop the traitors and “color of law”, gun control, foreign entities, etc is lawful and backed by the US Constitution in writing under our legitimate government.</p>
<p>Gun control, of any type is Treason against the American people.</p>
<p>It is important to realize that under the US Constitution, the people now pretending to hold offices within our general (federal) government actually have no lawful authority.  They must be replaced however it takes us to do so.  Since our elections are  fraudulent, recall is a joke, the other resource we must use to restore our constitutional republic is the Militia.</p>
<p>As Dr. Vieira says here: “This has nothing to do with personalities or subjective ideas. It’s a matter of what the Constitution provides…  The government of the United States has never violated anyone’s constitutional rights…  The government of the United States will never violate anyone constitutional rights, because it cannot violate anyone’s constitutional rights. </p>
<p>The reason for that is: The government of the United States is that set of actions by public officials that are consistent with the Constitution. Outside of its constitutional powers, the government of the United States has no legitimacy. It has no authority; and, it really even has no existence. It is what lawyers call a legal fiction.</p>
<p>… the famous case Norton v. Shelby County… The Court said: “An unconstitutional act is not a law; it confers no rights; it imposes no duties. It is, in legal contemplation, as inoperative as though it had never been passed.” </p>
<p>And that applies to any (and all) governmental action outside of the Constitution…”<br/>
What are the defining characteristics of a limited government? They are its disabilities; what it does not have legal authority to do. Look at the First Amendment… What does it do? It guarantees freedom of speech, freedom of press, freedom of religion.  But how does it do that? I quote: “Congress shall make no law abridging the freedom of speech or of the press” etcetera. “Congress shall make no law;” that’s a statement of an absence of power. That’s a statement of a disability.” (end quote)</p>

<content:encoded>Welcome aboard. We are all Americans, no matter which side of the conservative/liberal paradigm our current perspectives indicate. You may enjoy reading a book by Howard Zinn — The Underground History of America — in which he points out the same observations you have shared. Book opens up with an entry in the ship Captain log by Christopher Columbus, noting his views on how useful the “natives” would be as servants, and how easily they could be subdued. Human history begs for an elevation in individual morality, that the mass-mind of mankind can heal its primordial predispositions toward violence against our fellow man. 
<p>Salute!<br/>

<content:encoded>Human beings are simply a very aggressive species.  If we don’t choose to change it’ll be over soon, for the whole planet.  The “good Christians” who founded the US did not discover an uninhabited land.  They deliberately and systematically exterminated the native peoples living here to steal the land.  They deliberately gave them smallpox and measles, and stole and murdered the native children.  The Indian Schools were created to “re-educate” thousands of young children who were stolen from their families.  There is research showing as high as a 50% mortality rate in these schools due to physical and sexual abuse, disease, starvation and exposure.  It was genocide- pure and simple. All religions have been historically mis-used to perpetrate evil.  Divide and conquer is the time-tested strategy of the .1%, the elite banksters who are stealing it all while we fight against each other for the crumbs.  War has never worked, anywhere.  How ’bout some peace and tolerance instead of ignorance and hatred?  The mainstream media is their propaganda tool, its ALL lies. If a newscaster’s or politician’s mouth is moving, their lying.  It takes a lot of time and work to educate yourself online, but we need to smarten up, come together and seek out peaceful alternatives to our inate knee-jerk aggression.  I’m a bleeding heart liberal as my late dad used to call me, but I joined OK after reading a blog by Foster Gamble written after Sandy Hoax.  I tell my friends I went so far left I came out on the right (on some things).

<content:encoded>Let me add this concept….
<p>We are also learning that a two-fold approach to a One World Government involves years of preparations for moving a mass amount of Islamic refugees into Europe and North America . NOT for their safety…but to further destroy civilization by destroying free speech and other basic civil rights in-order to consolidate control into the hands of a few families that run the world’s mega corporations and banking system. </p>
<p>The Illuminati are showing their cards and moving forward to enslave humanity, because they fear a united front, by the people, all races and cultures, of whom can upset their plans. By infusing a dangerous culture across Europe and North America, will dis-allow nativism and revolt by Christians and others to control government(s). </p>
<p>Note: Pay close attention to mainstream media and those behind the scenes ridiculing anyone speaking-out against illegal immigration and Muslim refugees. They are either compartmentalized or they are part of what is coming. </p>
<p>Russia Today TV (RT) promotes the infusion and the creation of a culture clash, for other reasons that gives Putin an opportunity to recover the Balkan regions lost during the fall of the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>“We are not just in a physical war, but  spiritual war, and we must put on our spiritual armor in order to  be victorious.”</p>

<content:encoded>The problem with some at board level in the OK corral is that they grant Islam religious status with Constitutional protections. How they come to this conclusion in light of voluminous statements, writings, and historical events that show the incompatibility with our Constitution is beyond explanation…but I’d love to hear someone try. So OK Central is saying that the goal of Islam IS NOT to become the world conquering “religion”???

<content:encoded>I agree with most of the column but find some of chucks comments naive and contradictory. While Islam may not be THE problem, to give cover to the Gov recognizing Islam as a religion and qualifies 1st Amdt protection is ludicrous. I thought Chuck was into bold truth?  To also claim no ties to mosques within our borders to acts of  murder or mayhem also leaves me shaking my head in disbelief. Have we forgotten our homegrown jihadists already? The ties between Oklahoma beheader and the iman at his mosque and the Boston mosque where the Zarnev bros attended. How bout in between those places close to where a  county clerk saga took place… <a href="http://www.clarionproject.org/analysis/muslim-alliance-north-america" rel="nofollow">http://www.clarionproject.org/analysis/muslim-alliance-north-america</a><br/>

It doesn’t matter whether these places are allowed to operate with full knowledge of Gov entities to create havoc, or they be autonomous…the remedy is the same…give them the boot of truth…Islam seeks to supplant our form of Gov and make it subservient to its “Allah”…this is true whether you are Sunni or Shia. Once the competition is removed they will turn their sights on removing you.<br/>

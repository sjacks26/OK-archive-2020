<p>Testimonial:  I’m not new to Oathkeepers but never sent a testimonial.  I decided it was time.  I was a Firefighter for the State of Nevada for many years, since retired.  As such, I was also tasked with enforcing forestry and fire law.  I worked very closely with the resident LE’s, so close in fact, that I frequently “backed them up” due to their lack of resources at the time.  We frequently discussed the Constitution/Bill of Rights and LE’s effect on this topic.</p>
<p>But back to my original thoughts.  I want everyone to know that when I took the Oath of Office, I understood completely that I was promising to protect the Constitution, a simple piece of paper…..not a county sheriff, not a governor, not a president (or current dictator).  My responsibility was to that simple paper that allowed this country to become the greatest on earth.  I still feel that way.  More so now that our current illegal government is using it as a “dart board” to decide which right to take away next!</p>
<p>I am especially protective of the 2nd Amendment because without it, the others mean nothing.  I have made it clear to all of my  representatives/senators that I will not be abiding by any further infringements to my right to bear arms, telling them all that I will still allow my kids and friends to borrow my weapons, I will gift my weapons to whomever I wish, I will not be turning in my hi-cap mags, and I will never register my semi autos or any other weapon in my possession.</p>
<p>My father was a WWII vet who spent over 3 years in Europe.  He told me, back in the 1960’s that sooner or later we would see the illegal expansion of government and a serious threat to our rights.  He also taught me that I was responsible for making sure that this government did not succeed in an American takeover.  I teach my kids the same.</p>
<p>I try to donate monthly to the OK, NRA, and 2nd Amendment Foundation.  Keep up the good work, Oathkeepers, and keep your powder dry.</p>
<p>J.H.</p>

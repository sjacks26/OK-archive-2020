## Stewart Rhodes; Dave Freeman

SR: I’d like to read something General George Washington said to his men before the Battle of Long Island. The time is now near at hand which must probably determine whether Americans are to be freemen or slaves, whether they are to have any property they can call their own; whether their houses and farms are to be pillaged and destroyed, and they consigned to a state of wretchedness from which no human efforts will probably deliver them. The fate of unborn millions will now depend, under God, on the courage and conduct of this army.

SR: (0:00:44.1) We are concerned and we fear that the time might be near at hand today that may determine whether or not our children will be free or will be consigned to utter wretchedness. Their liberty depends on the conduct of this Army, this Marine Corps, this Air Force, this Navy, this Coast Guard, Reserves, National Guard, and you veterans. And these police officers.

Caption: Oath Keepers Declaration of Orders We Will NOT Obey April 19, 2009 on the Lexington Greene Lexington, MA

SR: (0:01:24.1) Dave is gonna read these in summary, then we’ll elaborate a bit on each point.

DF: We will not obey orders to disarm the American people

Crowd: Cheers

SR: (0:01:43.8) As you well know, the attempt to do just that on April 19, 1775, led to the fighting and Revolution. We fear and we are concerned that the same thing could happen again and once again be the spark.

## SR seems about to cry at this point. He steps back from the mic for a moment

Person in the crowd: Out of my cold dead hands

SR: That’s right, not on our watch. That’s the last thing we ever want to see, to have our military and police used against us. As one young deputy sheriff from Texas said, I don’t think David Rockefeller knows how to fly an F-15.

Crowd: laughter

SR: Or how to drive a tank. Or how to put on riot gear and pepper spray with sticks. He doesn’t know how to do those things. He said they can’t do it without us, they can’t do it without you. Without you, they’re powerless. That’s our message and our mission. It’s pretty simple really. (0:02:52.2) We do want to make clear, when we talk about these things, these orders, we’re not talking about an officer who has to take a gun off a drunk before he puts him in the tank. We’re talking about sweeping disarmament of the American people. Let’s make that clear.

DF: (0:03:09.2) We will not obey orders to conduct warrantless searches of the American people.

Crowd: Cheers

SR: (0:03:24.6) As I already said, that was one of the causes of the American Revolution, the use of writs of assistance. We have seen in modern days a very disturbing trend to say, oh we don’t need a warrant. We can just spy on you, whether it’s the NSA or it’s for national security letters, or whatever other mechanism is used. Your security in your person, your papers and effects, your speech and your privacy, is in danger. That’s what we’re talking about here. In Katrina, we saw house to house searches without warrants, and we saw disarmament without people. The two go together. How do you think they’re going to take your guns away from you? They’re gonna get a warrant for your house in particular with probable cause? No. It will be by general sweeps through your homes or roadblocks and sweeps through your cars. So to protect the 2nd you better pay attention to the 4th.

DF: (0:04:22.5) We will not obey orders to detain American citizens as unlawful enemy combatants

DF: Or to subject them to military tribunal.

SR: (0:04:45.4) This is something, when I first saw at Yale Law School, that really scared the hell out of me. I saw, at that school, both liberals and conservatives willing to treat American citizens as if they were over in Afghanistan or Iraq, out of fear of terrorism. The support of this claim that, once the President is elected he’s like an elected dictator, that may sound like an exaggeration. But the claim is that the President on his own say so alone can designate anyone to be an unlawful enemy combatant and a combatant in the War on Terrorism. The problem is that doesn’t just apply to people from Afghanistan or Iraq, the claim is they can do it to you.

Person in the crowd: That’s all of us.

SR: (0:05:34.3) All of you, any of you, that’s right. That claimed power was given a rubber stamp by the Supreme Court in 2004 in the Hamdi case, when the Court said there’s nothing that prevents the U.S. government from treating a U.S. citizen as an enemy combatant. Which means that once the President designates you that way, there’s no longer a requirement for an indictment, you no longer get a jury trial, it can be a military tribunal, just like the Starr Chamber that the Founders looked back on in the history of England. Kangaroo courts. That’s why you have the right to a jury trial in this country. That could also be a spark. You might not realize is that was first proposed in 1995 by two lawyers who wrote a law review article, I think it was Oklahoma City Law Review, they wanted to apply the laws of war to McVeigh and the militias back then. They urged the Clinton Administration to do that, citing the same case precedents that were later used by the Bush Administration. What Clinton did not have the power to do, Bush has put into place, and the Supreme Court has rubber stamped it. Now President Obama can declare you an unlawful enemy combatant, very serious stuff.

Person in the crowd: Tyranny

SR: That’s right. There is no such thing as a constitutional republic where you can be black bagged in the middle of the night. The two things are inconsistent. Every dictatorship in the history of mankind, whether it’s fascist or communist or whatever they call it, has always set aside the normal procedures of due process in times of emergency, under claimed emergency conditions. In Nazi Germany, they were called People’s Courts. If you were a normal criminal, you’d go to the normal criminal system. If you were a political opponent of the state, they would take you to these special courts, hand picked by the Nazi party, full of Nazis, that’s where you’d be tried. What kind of trial is that? Same thing happened in Stalinist Russia, kangaroo trials, show trials. We can’t let that happen here. We need to wake up.

DF: (0:07:53.7) We will not obey orders to impose martial law or a state of emergency on any state.

SR: (0:08:11.3) For each one of these points, when you go to our website. Down the road we’ll have a more functional website. If you go there, you’ll see the explanation in more detail on each of these points. What we’re talking about here is, if there’s gonna be any emergency situation in a state, it needs to be handled by the state governor and legislature, by that state’s National Guard or that state’s militia. When we get a revitalized militia, it will be the militia. But for now it darn well better be the National Guard of that state under the command of that governor. If he needs help from anybody else, he’ll let them know. He will invite them. If he does not invite them, he’s got no business in his state.

DF: (0:09:05.9) We will not obey orders to invade and subjugate any state that asserts its sovereignty.

SR: (0:09:21.7) We have seen lately a resurgence of an awareness of the 10A and the importance of state sovereignty. This is a constitutional republic with divided government between the national government and the states, as made very clear by our 10A. We’ve had some people say, oh you’re trying to reconstitute the Confederacy. No, this has nothing to do with the Confederacy. It has everything to do with the structure of the constitutional republic of 1787. Jefferson and Madison, when they wrote the Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions, that is what they were talking about. We harken back to them. All these resolutions, when you read them, they’re just a modern adaptation of what Madison and Jefferson wrote in those resolutions, pointing out the obvious limits and lines of the federal government’s powers and the states’ authority. We support these modern re-adaptations of their core principles that are our constitutional republic. And we will not, if say Montana decrees and rules that the US Government has violated the compact by which Montana entered the Union, my favorite state by the way, if that were to happen. If the US Government were to come in in violation of the sovereignty of the State of Montana and try to subjugate them, to support and defend the Constitution, the troops should stand down. And let the feds know, go do it by yourselves.

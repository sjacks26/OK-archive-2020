<content:encoded>Sam,who? are these so-called officials that have come into Burns,Oregon- are they FBI? There is a voice call between Judge Gary Darby and our Military-asking for protection for the people as they”are in fear for their lives” the mention of French Mercenaries as well. There is NO doubt something is really wrong here. Again, folks study @ annavonreitz.com. Restoring our organic Constitution-Common Law is key..

<content:encoded>Then tell me, why do land owners have to pay a tax (rent) to the Leviathon every year? Why, if I want to burn the weeds off,”my land” do I need to get permission? There are more people than I can shake a stick at that have more say on what I can do, or not! So is it really mine?    NO!<br/>
The Government ALREADY thinks they own all the land. They think they own the animals and the fish too.<br/>
Why does one have to buy a licence to hunt the “Kings” deer?<br/>
Why do the serfs of this land put up with it? I couldn’t tell you that, I guess they don’t want to get gunned down on a lonely stretch of road. Our Government doesn’t seem to have a problem doing that.<br/>
A wise man once said “If we don’t hang together, we will hang separately”. And I’m afraid,gentlemen, we are spread way too thin………….

<content:encoded>What I’ve observed and learned over the last 22 Months since the Bundy Ranch stand off with the BLM, ATFE, FBI and the like is that removing the feds (and the DHS contract killers) from private land use will be very difficult at best case.  It’s not just the land grab, it’s all of the federal intrusion and controlling that has taken place over the last 150 years or so in virtually all aspects of our lives–like the IRS, BLM, EPA and so forth.  In addition there are many “back-door” and “closed-door” deals taking place right before our eyes with China, United Nations and many others.  I’m very concerned about this to say the least.  It’s the largest and most insightful takeover in our nation’s history–bar none.  This will effect not only our neighborhood stability but our “home town” stability, state-wide stability, etc.  Equorial is correct, “we are under attack”.

<content:encoded>In my opinion, the paramount question to be asked and answered is:  What will be the community’s response in areas where rogue police – oath breakers conducting unconstitutional maneuvers, either under direction from some so-called authority or as an independent self-interest group – are operating?

<content:encoded>This is just another ‘part’ of The Master Plan imho.  After all, if the gov can truly convince everyone that THEY OWN ALL LAND ….then it would be a small matter (to them) to force ppl to move into cities/metros (where everyone would be far, far safer and monitored by ‘cams’ on every street corner).  The Constitution prohibits The Feds from owning a square inch of property OR “governing” any part of ‘land use and rights’ (of the owner).  These days, they not only want all land, but they want it to “trash” by digging up uranium and other PMs (I suppose).  If they “force ownership” to themselves then nobody gets any $$ for what’s harvested from your (used to be) property.  I could go on and on but I’m sure everyone gets this picture ….and hell yeah, it IS coming to a town near you, or perhaps to YOUR town next.  I believe this is why you never hear a word about this crap on TV ….the media has been forbidden to tell us “we are under attack” in a big way and we’d best do something about it ….or die.  “Here we come – Ready or not!”

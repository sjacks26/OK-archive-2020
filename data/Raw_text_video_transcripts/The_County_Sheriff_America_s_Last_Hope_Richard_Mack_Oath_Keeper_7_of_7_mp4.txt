Richard Mack: [00:00:02] And we're going to just shift this and we're going to educate those federal agents that come in our county and think they own our county. We found out what goes wrong and what happens when you have sheriffs abdicate their authority and let the federal government run amok. We saw what happens in Ruby Ridge. We saw what happens at Waco. These people that come in and can hit and run. your sheriff isn't a hit and run guy. He lives there. It's his people, his community, it's his home, his family lives there. And I've talked this over with Randy Weaver a lot and he totally agrees with me that if the sheriffs had remained in charge in both Ruby Ridge and Waco, the law would still have been in force what little there was. And nobody would have been killed, especially federal agents. And yet everything would have been worked out fine. And Randy would still have his wife and son and maybe grandkids Now from Sam's kids. And 89 people wouldn't have had burned to death in Waco. 

Richard Mack: [00:01:06] And this is that serious. Why. Because we're talking about our country here. and this stuff is this stuff is just basic fundamentals here. It's just all right here. And this was the first book I wrote, pursuant to the the Mack Prince case at the U.S. Supreme Court and there's a quote in there from Alan Keyes that says this, we can. The only difference between today's slavery and the slavery of the old south is that at least the plantation owners had to pay for the chains. 

Richard Mack: [00:01:45] And folks John Adams was asked during the Revolutionary War, can we really do this. There are some of you in here that are incredulous about what I've said and what's here. if you got a better plan Tell me because I'm going to jump on it. because I don't see anything more effectual, more rapid, more easy. You don't have to work with Washington is the biggest thing. You have to work with your friends in your own community to get this done. But they were facing the greatest power on earth. Maybe we are today. The one with all the armies and the weaponry. the one with all the money, with all the attorneys, with all the armies, all soldiers and they're going to follow orders. They ask that to John Adams How could we be Great Britain. They got the biggest navy, we don't have any. It's the same answer today my dear friends. Duty is ours. Results are God's. So we do our duty and we leave the rest to him. 

Richard Mack: [00:02:52] When I was. Yeah real quick. Great. No no. I'm glad you brought that up. Perfect. Great question. First of all yeah they sue us now not us them. I wish I'd never filed a lawsuit. There was a sheriff what county was it from, Nixon, re Nixon. When we did the lawsuit he was here in Montana. He gave the answer. Maybe in Lincoln County. He says I'm not doing the Brady Bill and I refuse to do it. Never joined the lawsuit. And here's Prince and I, spending hundreds of thousands of dollars. Cost me my re-election bid. I guess it helped Jay. But it didn't help me at all. And. This is the thing I learned. There's not enough time or money to go after the federal government on Every one of these deals. so make them sue us if they will. They're not going to have time to do it either. There's not time even with them and all their money. And even if a court tells me I can't stand in their way. You know what I'll do tomorrow. I'll stand in their way. and I'll require it. And you know what. Maybe I'll give him a tour of the Mack hotel and let him see what that's like. And I'm going to keep going and I will uphold and defend the Constitution. I don't care what Judge tells me not to. I don't care what legislature tells me not to. I don't care what federal officer tells me to do. I don't care if the wife or the barber down Main Street tells me not to do this. I'm going to keep my oath and I'll stop keeping my oath when I get out of office. I. 

Richard Mack: [00:04:46] No more lawsuits. I'm not going to do any more lawsuits. I don't want any sheriff doing lawsuits. I learned three and a half almost four years and $350000 later. we won and everybody ignored it anyway. OK I'm the only one that's brought it back. And yeah sheriff Prince was right. now we need after we give this to him, you can't give your sheriff courage. I hope he's a good enough person that when you go to him he musters up some on his own. But you've got to stand behind him. He needs to form posses with people like you. That's the best way to protect the right to keep and bear arms is make everybody in the county a member of the posse and give them an id saying if any federal agent comes up to you he says hey I got my share of posse idea that says I'm supposed to be armed. If you want to disarm me check with the sheriff. Yeah. I'm armed. 

Richard Mack: [00:05:39] These are simple things that can happen. These are true simple and powerful things that can happen. And you know I feel I'm feeling the freedom juices flowing and I'm going to finish my talk the way I always do. OK. When I was searching the Constitution as a rookie cop, I told you the story, well while I was studying the Constitution there came a notice down in the briefing room of constitutional studies for law enforcement officers issued by post. In the state of Utah. and this instructor was somebody I hope you've heard of W Cleon Skousen. and he used to work with the FBI with my father. He was a friend of my father in law, fathers in law. And so I went to this and I had to take vacation time to go because my chief wouldn't let me go. Swen would not let me go. And so I took a vacation. I was the only one of 240 cops that was there on my own time. 

Richard Mack: [00:06:42] And during this two day seminar this frail powerful kind of homely man converted me to the United States Constitution. And I do mean converted and it was a powerful religious experience for me and I loved it. And during one time we were in a building twice this big. He made all of us get up and he stood up on a pedestal back here and he took us through a kindergarten exercise. And I leave it with you as my complete devotion to you and my country and to my kids that I've taught this to and to my precious little liberty, my first grandchild born three years ago yesterday. Her name is liberty and I've taught it to her and she knows it all. She knows it by heart now and it's amazing how smart people can get if you put the truth in front of them. And so I leave it with you today. 

Richard Mack: [00:07:38] I'll answer questions later if you wanna come and see me while you're getting five or six more books to get these out there. And this little kinder- kindergarten exercise goes like this. We the People of the United States in order to form a more perfect union, establish justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty, to ourselves and our Posterity do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America. And that's the eagle long may she be free. Thank you Very much

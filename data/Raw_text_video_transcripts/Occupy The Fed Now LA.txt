M1: There’s a possibility of people rebelling, waking up. Not to say that it has, you only have so many thousand people out here. It’s gotta grow into something real. You talk about 99%. If you even represent with the Einstein theory of 2%, we’re talking about 6m people. But this could be the infancy of that.

W1: Tell me again what your thoughts on the Constitution are.

M1: If the Constitution was enforced effectively and properly, we wouldn’t be here today. The Constitution is a beautiful document. But it’s not been enforced ever. To this day, it hasn’t been effective, it hasn’t been enforced. Once the Constitution is enforced, we wouldn’t need this, even though it’s our right and our duty to rebel when things aren’t going the way. It’s in the Constitution.

W1: It’s in the Declaration of Independence

M1: People need to be educated on the Constitution. Most people are not.

W1: What are some of the infringements on the Constitution you’ve seen recently.

M1: First, let’s talk about 16A. It was never ratified. Taxation without representation is tyranny. (0:01:17.2) We shouldn’t even be income taxed, it was never ratified. Now if it was ratified, that’s a different story. People are to jail to this day for not paying their taxes the way the IRS wants them. The IRS is not even an American-run organization. Neither is the Fed. That’s what we’re at. This is just the beginning of something.

W1: Do you support ending the Fed?

M1: Definitely. So did Andrew Jackson. But the only power we’ve ever had in this country is when the people act up, put to the fire the people we put in power to run things. We haven’t done it. Maybe this is something. They’re so greedy, they’ve taken so much, they’re just off. Normally the crumbs fall from the table and that pacifies us enough not to take to the street. Now they’re so greedy, the crumbs aren’t falling from the table. The 10% unemployment. Maybe this will set off something real, and we’ll go right back to take these rich guys out of the street. I mean they used to hang people in the street, the rich guys.

W1: They used to tar and feather them.

M1: Exactly (0:02:34.8). They’d go to their house or store. When you’re trying to do something against the people, that’s how it would go down. People don’t know that. This is really mild compared to how it used to be.

W1: What do you do for a living?

M1: I’m a schoolteacher.

W1: Here in LA unified?

M1: I’m in LA county, not LA unified. It’s so difficult to get in LA unified, they haven’t been hiring in years. 

W1: What’s your feeling about the 2 party system? Democrats and Republicans.

M1: I believe there’s the two parties. The Democrat party is only there to make us think we have a choice. It’s a 1 party system. They’re all part of the same system.

W1: Which flag would you say you’re most closely affiliated with?

M1: Neither.

W1: You’re an independent?

M1: Yeah. All the way.

W1: What’s your name?

M1: Paul.

W1: Is there anything else you want to say to the Oath Keepers about being out here?

M1: Hopefully we really wake up and have a real revolution and change this thing. It really needs to be thrown out. Now if we were to enforce the Constitution, we wouldn’t be here. But if that’s not going to happen, we need to wash everything, throw it all out, start over from scratch. Maybe that can go down. Right now, I’m just happy to see young people wake up. LA, wow. I’ve never seen this.

W1: Have you ever served in the military?

M1: Yes.

W1: What branch?

M1: Army reserve.

W1: Excellent. When did you serve?

M1: 92-2000.

W1: Wow, so you did 8 years. What was your MOS?

M1: Communications.

W1: Fantastic. So you might be interested in the Oath Keepers message.

M1: You know, I got into the military and I really liked what I heard and saw for a while. Then I realized that their whole way of keeping everybody in check was a lie to you to get you to do what they want you to do, I really, it lost me. I respect them, though, I respect the military thing. I’m discontented, I’ve been discontented for years. I brought my children here to see rebelliousness. We need to rebel, it’s our duty. Things aren’t right, so we need to rebel, we need to wake up. Gotta act up.

W1: Thanks man.

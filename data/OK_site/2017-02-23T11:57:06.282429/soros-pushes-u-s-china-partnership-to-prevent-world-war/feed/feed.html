<p>The elites own Russia and China lock stock and barrel.  Putin dines with Kissinger on a regular basis and the Rockefellers basically wrote China’s social policies.  There is no battle between the BRICS and the IMF.  They are one in the same entity.</p>

<content:encoded>The behind the scenes war is between the IMF and BRICS. Both are vying for a one world government and control of all financial markets within their membership countries. I think the big secret about the TPP, which will not be released for 4 years, most likely details a strategic plan to (force) member countries under the TPP to continue trading in USD currency. While the BRICS development banking strategy is to take as many countries under their system of banking/currencies while dropping the dollar. BRICS is being led by Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa. There are many more countries coming onboard and the IMF is relying on U.S. military aggression and intimidation to keep users of USD in-check. The biggest problem with the TPP is the dictatorial powers Obama and (next) Hillary will have. She and Jeb Bush are selected prime puppets for the New World Order. It will not matter which one takes the crown….we have some serious problems heading our way. Like they say…”THEY will create so much chaos and disparity on the world’s population, of which THEY will all of a sudden offer a solution of a world government(sic).” Their plans are well underway…but their biggest problem might not be Russia, but the 150 million gun owners in America. That kind of screws-up their strategic planning, but let’s see if “Jade Helm 15” goes LIVE this summer. If it does…it means they are ready to rock and roll with the people. If Texas DOESN’T get their gold bars from the NY FED, then Jade Helm 15’s assertion that Texas is a “Hostile” state will be almost subliminal. BTW….China and Russia are not so much a Communist country anymore and I think the title is good for the traitors in Washington and the type of government evolving within.  Just look at the Communist ties Obama and Valerie Jarrett have had all their life, including Hillary Clinton. Operation Paperclip backfired on the American people.

<content:encoded>“… but foreign rule can now be established over all the land. In the draft of the TPA foregin unchecked migration is here.”
<p>No, lawfully it cannot not.  Our legitimate government is a Constitutional Republic under the Constitution of the United States of America, and we have not given OUR PERMISSION for that to be ended. Nor will we ever.</p>
<p>It matters not if it is US (actually UN) troops or foreign troops, or even state  or federal LE’s, since WE have not done away with the US Constitution it is an act of Treason by all who honorbound to the US Constitution and America. Defending ourselves will tick off those who”just follow orders” and “just do their jobs” (Traitors, not by their own choice but by their actions), maybe hurt their feelings that we will NOT allow them to attack us.  </p>
<p>But that is OUR LAWFUL right under the US Constitution.  TPP, NDAA, Patriot Act, and many others are just acts of TREASON against the American people and the US Constitution.</p>
<p>Soros needs to be arrested for Treason after a (real) Grand Jury Investigation is performed – if it (the charge of treason) applies.</p>
<p>Just because some jerk serving within our governments says “this is the law”, “this is the treaty”, “etc”; does NOT make it so.  </p>
<p>READ the US Constitution and you will see the actual LAWFUL authority each BRANCH has – notice that the authority does NOT go to a person, they are ALLOWED to use it under listed, written, directions/duties/authority and ONLY those that are written within the US Constitution are LAWFUL here in the USA.  Not person who SERVES within our governments were given that authority, and lots of other that they are PRETENDING (color of law) to have, or lying that they have, etc.  Those very reasons is why it is all written within the US Constitution, and within state Constitutions, so that there is NO doubt what those who SERVE are ALLOWED to do – and under what circumstances, and what is FORBIDDEN to them to do or NOT to do (ex: to not enforce our lawsw because they don’t want to).</p>
<p>Stay SAfe All!</p>
<p>God Bless!</p>
<p>Molon Labe!!</p>

<content:encoded>It is fundimentally over now for individual American sovereignty as what used to be recognonized in the Bill of Rights. As a Human created by God, as a child of the one incomprehensible all powerful infinite God of the Cosmos, your sovereignty as a free Human is still YOURS if you want it. And its time now to pick yourself up and gather when your brothers and sisters. Total tyrany is official now June of 2015! The states may or may not be ready for it but foreign rule can now be established over all the land. In the draft of the TPA foregin unchecked migration is here. A large part of it is from Turkey to the US, If you are certain type of true American of certain regions of the US and Canada you are at threat from middle-easterners seeking to “bond” with you. Americans and Canadians who love liberty need to help fight off the invaders trying to transform the culture!

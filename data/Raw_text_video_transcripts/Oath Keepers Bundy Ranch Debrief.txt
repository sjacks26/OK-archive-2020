Text on screen before Rhodes begins: “Official Oath Keepers Statement Regarding the Bundy Ranch”

SR: Confrontation on 4/12 led to OK leaving. RC and BR were at the ranch. SH is Nebraska chapter president, been with Rhodes on site since the beginning. Want to clarify and explain “why we did what we did” (0:00:37.1). OK were on site before the cows were taken, during it, and ever since. 2 guys from Montana, Rick and Ben, came down Thursday before confrontation, were on overwatch (0:00:54.7). Half our guys here are combat vets. Justin Giles from Alaska. We aren’t cowards. There are problems with the camp in terms of lack of security. We came as support function. Whoever the leader is, we’re okay with that – turned out to be Jerry DeLemus from New Hampshire. Our guys were under his command. We brought logistics and support (0:02:10.8). We also brought a comms team and a med team from Montana.

SR: There are issues there with security. There’s this crazy little dog from AZ, Jerry wouldn’t kick him out. There are nutbags running amok in the camp. Friday, the day we put out intel on potential missile strike, before that we told Jerry we (OK) wanted to perform scout function. If we didn’t do it, it wouldn’t be done. Part of why I wanted to do a scout mission on Friday was to get my guys out of the camp (0:03:49.5). Increasing infighting. A bunch of separate militias, each with its own camp. A bunch of hotheads. Weren’t under sufficient command and control. We did not like the situation, we wanted our guys to pull out and be deployed separately. I proposed that to Jerry, he said yes. After that, we got a phone call from a guy in TX with contacts in DOD who told him that Eric Holder has given approval for a drone strike on the ranch (0:04:43.2), including Bundy’s home. We immediately got Jerry and David Helms on the phone and had this guy repeat the info. Then we took the info down to the security team, to Booda and those guys down at the home, and told them we would try to confirm it (0:05:15.0). This guy in TX, we have a retired intelligence guy – worked with CIA, worked with Delta, had been an interrogator – he went and met the source in person in Dallas and vetted him. We were waiting to hear back from our intel guy before we did anything else (0:05:38.5). While waiting for that, a lady (Mrs. Sharp) and her kids were there to sing. I was concerned for the children, I had two guys (John Buyber [sp?] and George Hudson from Montana offer her a hotel room for her kids. They talked to her, she said no. “She got angry and said that we’re not trusting in god enough and that it’s her mission to be there and god put her there” (0:06:47.6). She started yelling and screaming, the Mountainmen [sp?] guys led by the crazy little dog started yelling at them about starting rumors. Then my guys drove back to the main camp. Steve, what happened then?

SH: Ryan Bundy came in

SR: Right, Ryan Bundy came in and said we don’t want to spread rumors. Ryan Bundy called me and said don’t tell anybody else about this until you’ve got some solid confirmation. I said okay. (0:07:51.2). We held off on any further communication with anybody else while waiting for confirmation. We had agreed to tell the guys, to give them the option to stay or move off. David and I were going to the airport to pick up Sheriff Peyman, when we left, I told Ben, my guy from Montana who was Jerry’s XO, I said Ben, anybody who stays needs to be dug in deep in a spider hole with Mylar over the top to make it hard to see them (0:08:52.3). They also need to move a little bit around. The rest need to be scouts. While we were gone, they had a confrontation in the CP. Mountain Men had been yelling at us earlier, were mad we were telling our guys about this. Tell them what happened next. (0:09:53.4) Steve is a Vietnam vet, combat vet, took a bullet, has shrapnel in his arm. He has a bad heart, has 5 stints. He’s not a damned coward.

SH: I was explaining our mission change to OK, to fall back to hotel, and explain to them to dig in if they were gonna stay.

SR: We were gonna deploy out as scouts.

SH: Right. Or deploy out as scouts. That was our new mission change. I briefed them on the intel on the strike. I was talking to 2 or 3 different factions, one that was very irritated and highly antagonistic.

SR: That was the Mountain Men.

SH: Right. People kept coming in to get info and see what was going on. (0:11:13.7). It was mass confusion.

SR: We were still waiting for confirmation, we got that confirmation. Our intel guy called and said he sat down with the source and vetted him. Our guy said this source was credible as far as who he said he was (CIA, Delta work), and came across as credible and sincere in what he was saying. You can hear the interview online. It’s still possible that this source was being fed bad intel, but it was true that this man believed what he was telling us. (0:12:07.3) He said that given his experience, he ranked this intel a 6 or 7 out of 10 in credibility. To him, that was enough that he would move the CP and redeploy his people, if he were in charge. David, what would you do if you were in command?

DH: Move the camp.

SR: Move the camp and redeploy your people. To us, that was enough to let people know. So we let Jerry know. Brandon and Robert were on that phone call with Jerry. The intel officer was on the phone call too. Jerry and I agreed to tell the media as a way to counter it. They want to use cover of darkness, so we can use media to counteract that. After that, David what did you tell our guys?

DH: I told guys to move to new CP and establish roving patrols. Anyone who wanted to stay needed to dig in.

SR: After we told our guys that, Steve was assaulted. Tell us what happened (0:14:49.1).

SH: Lots of people coming in the CP. A couple trucks drove in, guys started jumping out, were very agitated. One guy ran out and stood in front of one of our cars, CT President [John Buyler?] was there. The guy came and ran at me and hit me in the chest with a forearm and put me down.

SR: And that was Jack, one of Jerry DeLemus’s guys from New Hampshire (0:15:27.8) who did that, who dropped you in the dirt.

SH: He dropped me and then went to John [Buyler?] and threw him to the ground.

SR: And you were seeing stars?

SH: Oh yeah, I’ve got these five stints. I thought I was having a heart attack. A bunch of guys around me were trying to help me. It was pretty chaotic.

SR: So this guy Jack knocked a combat vet with a bad heart on his ass. That’s what he did.

RC: For the record, I was not there, it would have been different if I was. That’s not tough talk. Most of the militia, if you’ve seen the movie Gladiator, the son runs in after the battle and says where are they let me fight. “I was there, he [Brandon] was there, locked and cocked in a vehicle, overwatching the standoff on the hill as requested by David Bundy.” We were the ones in the crosshair. “90% of these militia, weren’t there” (0:16:55.0). These guys were not there. Jerry, valiant effort, but you were not there. He wouldn’t be a fit commander. Facebook trolls, this Ryan guy’s Facebook was started this year, has no background. I’m a former PsyOps, this guy is not who he says he is. Ryan, you aren’t a Ranger brother. The OK were there, have been there. I left because I don’t play with crackpots. “There are some valiant warriors, there are some real patriots, not all militia are bad, because we’re militia, III%s and OK. Be very clear, these kids, they’re playing war out there and they don’t know what they’re doing.” (0:18:24.3) Jerry, you’re not a leader. You and your goat friend Glenn Beck need to realize you’re not a warrior.

SR: Jerry’s guys showed up, and I had no problem with him before this. And a lot of guys who showed up afterwards were pretty stalwart. I expect honesty, Jerry was part of that decision to go out as scouts and to tell the media. I coordinated with the chain of command before this happened. A real man would have admitted that he was involved in this decision. To my knowledge, Jerry hasn’t done that. (0:19:53.7) After this Jack guy dropped SH and dropped John [Buyler?] in the dirt, they told David what had happened. And David told them, tell them what you said.

DH: I told John to get Steve in a car and leave the camp. 

SR: When [Buyler?] was dropped, another Mountain Man militia guy put his hand on his gun and said “I dare you to draw, draw motherfucker I’m gonna kill you” (0:20:53.9). So they were being threatened. That’s why we told them to get out of there. We were this close to a gun fight right there in the camp. If they’re not gonna respect a Vietnam vet with a bad heart, what are they gonna do next? 

DH: John got Steve in the car, probably yelling at Steve.

SR: He said he was yelling. He was yelling at Steve come on, let’s go, we gotta get out. That’s why people think it was a panic situation. We’d already decided to dig in or go out as scouts. Some of our guys did stay there. All this nonsense that OK freaked out and ran is bull. This guy [Steve] doesn’t run for jack (0:22:17.6).

DH: I had to tell him repeatedly to go.

SR: So we got out of there and redeployed. We had guys on the roster to scout, and we did that. I pulled scout duty. (0:22:55.6). David did. I told Ryan Payne, give me a contact number, and Michelle Fiore. They never did. So I had to track down Brandon to give him intel. There was a FedEx truck, tell them Steve.

SH: Coming down the highway, we saw a FedEx truck with its lights on sitting there on a Sunday, thought that was strange. We did a 45 minute circuit. The FedEx truck had moved up the ramp towards the highway, was sitting there again, no driver in sight. We met up with Brandon, discussed it. Brandon, take it from here.

BR: I did a slow 360 around the truck. I repositioned myself. We met up again, they told me the truck had moved. I went back to the truck, it took off.

SR: It’s suspicious activity. The point is, that’s what a scout does, report back what he sees. They need that function out there, which is why we proposed being scouts. But I also wanted my guys out of that camp cause it was a circus.

BR: OK did not run, did not do anything that was already discussed.

SR: It was your [Brandon’s] advice that guys roll out as a QRF, right?

BR: Yep

SR: Guys could still provide overwatch, just be deployed out.

BR: Yep. It’s just simple, just push out, it’s not a big deal. There’s a lot of confusion there about the OK. OK has provided financial support, gear and equipment. This isn’t about the groups, it’s about the Bundys. Everybody out there, continue to support the Bundys. It’s about the federal government pushing themselves on American people. There are a lot of patriots out here. We need to make sure this all works.

RC: Yep. It’s important to keep in mind the bigger picture. First it was the race card, split camp. Then disinformation within the militias. We’re not gonna put our people in harm’s way with some crazy dudes. Keep supporting the groups, OK. SR was distributing stuff, FLIRs, comms. OK telling people, your family can camp out, but not in a militia compound, with a credible threat. Ryan, if you’re a leader, you don’t take votes. In the Marine Corps, we didn’t take votes as commanders. “Learn how to give orders and learn how to be a real man” (0:29:31.2). Mr. and Mrs. Bundy, be careful who you put in your inner circle. Next time, this OK and III%er might not come.

SR: We’re still here to support the Bundy family. I still have scouts out right now. When we roll out, we have FLIR and night vision, so we can see in the dark. We had one of our FLIRs stolen this morning. 

SH: We went out for detail. I decided to go talk to Jerry about all this, about 1:30am.

RC: April 28, for the record.

SH: While we were there, we had our gear. Had a conversation with everybody. It was calm, everybody talking.

SR: You circled up in a prayer, right?

SH: Yeah, we ended up our little meeting with a prayer, held each others’ hands, prayed to god. That’s been my focus, we’re supposed to be working together. Anyway, went back to the car and left. We had our two FLIRs on the center console. One of them wasn’t there. Looked around, nothing there. I went back into the CP tent to Jerry and said we’ve got a problem. One of our FLIRs is missing. Jerry was condescending, went to a tent or two and shined a flashlight, not a lot of effort. (0:32:38.0) Told me that if it comes up tomorrow I’ll call you. I told him then that any inroads we made were destroyed.

SR: So while they were praying, with their eyes shut and heads down, someone snuck in there and stole the FLIR. And you [Robert] had a conversation about FLIR that night, right?

RC: Correct. 

SR: I gave Jerry a FLIR, told him to hang on to it when he left so we could use it if we had a situation in NY or CT. All this stuff happened, he’s not being honest about what happened. (0:33:39.0) I told Robert that I need a team I can trust, so I’m giving you the FLIR. Tell Jerry that, it’s OK property, I can deploy it where I want. I told Robert to tell Jerry it was his now. What happened then?

RC: We didn’t get any response.

BR: I spoke with Josh, Josh and I are trying to make everybody work together. Justin’s personal comms that he left here and the FLIR, when everything’s done, need to make sure that gets back. Josh said okay with comms, but FLIR was given to my dad. I told him it was from the OK. The way I understand it, they’re keeping it.

SR: (0:35:31.7) We brought comms, ammunition, I don’t want that back. I want to see people well-equipped. Tons of food. But the really expensive stuff like FLIRs, I don’t want that walking off with some kooky guy, tried to make sure they would be with trust-worthy guys. The one that went missing, Jerry needs to police his camp, find it, and it goes with Robert. They need to have it. We’re down to one FLIR. It’s staying with our scout teams. Shouldn’t have to worry about this. “This is the tip of the iceberg of the cluster out there” (0:37:28.0). Rick Delap from Montana, been there for 2 weeks, the day of the confrontation, he had to draw on someone, 2 Mountain Men guys, one of them ran back to his vehicle, came back with an AR in his hand, Rick had to draw on him. If he had reached for his gun, Rick would have had to drop him.

RC: The day of the standoff, everybody was responsible, there were real patriots. There were women, there were people of every skin color, no racism. People disciplined with their weapons. Not everybody is a bad person out there.

SR: Not at all. The problem is the few complete nuts.  RC: Ryan, “you’re one of those nuts bro.” (0:38:50.2) You say people abandoned their post. You have no leadership or integrity.

SR: There are imbalanced people with weapons there, threatened my guys, came running with a weapon. People going around with “gunfighter claw.” “Crap like that is Hollywood nonsense” (0:39:24.0). “Among real fighters, you get dropped when you do that.” 

RC: Bundy’s need to be aware of what’s happening. Booda, you have no idea what’s going on. You’re only being told by a liaison. Devil Dog, I think you’re smarter than that.

SR: We’re being attacked, we need to defend ourselves. We aren’t trying to attack anyone. (0:40:16.6). I gotta set the record straight. We want to keep our guys separate, cause that is a cluster in there. We don’t want our guys back in there until it’s settled, not because we’re scared, we don’t want to have to shoot people.

RC: Your video today where you did your roll-call, how many of those people were at the standoff on that day? I guarantee, 90% were not there, including Jerry.

SR: I’m not gonna get into that. Good guys showed up later.

RC: True that.

SR: Jerry and his son were squared away until this stuff happened. I’m just asking Jerry to be honest (0:41:10.1). The first guy to help Steve when he hit the dirt was Josh [Jerry’s son]. Let’s cut the crap and get back to the mission to protect the Bundy family and let the bad guys know No More Free Wacos. (0:41:31.6) Be smart about it, if you’re there dig in. Don’t sit there in lawn chairs. We gave the Bundy’s $12k. We’re still supporting them. Didn’t have to do that, could have bought more body armor. Now, we have gear that we’re gonna keep for the next deployment, like FLIRs. Give us 2 cell phone numbers to contact. Our scouts need a contact. We don’t want to run the show, we just want to work with you. Give us a chain of communication, without that we can’t help you. This is a fight for the whole west. This isn’t the only fight. We’re telling our guys to get ready. (0:44:49.0). Matt Shea is working with us to get model legislation (0:45:08.7), a whole coalition of 17 western legislators were there because we paid for them to be there, we paid for sheriffs to get there, to support the Bundys. We had Sheriff Brad Rogers from Indiana, Sheriff Peyman from Kentucky, and Sheriff Jeff Christopher [from Delaware]. We can’t help people that don’t want our help. Great credit to the Bundy family, but they’ve gotta take control of their own ranch. People on that ranch might discredit the whole movement. 2 close calls, near firefights.

## video jumps

SR: When we got this intel, it was not confirmed, it was credible enough that we felt “an obligation, a moral duty to warn people” (0:46:46.2). Jerry agreed to warn the camp. I didn’t want it on my conscience later that a strike happened and I knew it might happen and I didn’t say anything. Justin Giles told us a story where he was deployed in Iraq and didn’t act on intel and 6 of his guys died. We weren’t gonna have that on conscience. If there’s a bomb threat in a school, you get the kids out, you don’t wait for confirmation. That’s why we warned the camp, to give the guys the choice. This might have been a PsyOps campaign, we still don’t know. We do know that we had a 2nd stream from an independent source. Tell them David.

DH: I got a phone call after all this, this guy is well known to me, he has contacts high up in DoD. He was hesitant to relate the story, was giving me bits and pieces. He was talking about the potential drone strike. These were separate sources talking about the same thing from sources high up in DoD.

SR: It’s either orchestrated PsyOps campaign, disinformation campaign to discredit us, through 2 different source points. Or it was actually legit, but maybe now they’re not doing it. We don’t know which one it is. Either way, we were being blown up, either psychologically and in the media or for real. It was not some crackpot on the internet or an anonymous phone call. It was 2 different sources, both from DoD.

DH: We agonized over this. Decided we had to let people know regardless. Moral obligation.

SR: We knew rumors were flying around. We knew it might discourage people from coming out. But we decided we had to tell people, and Jerry agreed (0:49:55.6).

BR: I said easy, push people out.

RC: I said it’s probably PsyOps. We just said move around.

SR: Jerry, you own that decision too.

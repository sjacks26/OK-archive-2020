<p><strong>AZPATRIOT</strong> – My rifle is ready. I’m ready to defend at any cost …</p>
<p>–</p>
<p><a href="../wp-content/uploads/2015/01/lexingtonconcord-440x300.png"><img alt="lexingtonconcord-440x300" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5254" height="300" src="../wp-content/uploads/2015/01/lexingtonconcord-440x300.png" width="440"/></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Ron Pariseau</strong> – Testimonial: On, April 20th, 2013, at the Connecticut State Capitol in Hartford, I re-affirmed my commitment and allegiance to the “Oath”! I did so proudly in 1966 before going off to War, and I did again, with the same excitement, commitment, and belief! I was born a FREE American, I will die a FREE American!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Today, “WE THE PEOPLE” declared “LEGAL WAR” on the Government of the State of Connecticut, which used to be known as the “Constitution State”! As of today, it is the “Un-Constitutional State” and will forever be a disgrace to the “Original Thirteen Colonies” of the United States of America!</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Ron Amos</strong> – Testimonial: Having served with US Army Intelligence,  1961-1968, I always thought the greatest threat to our Nation and our liberty, would come from a foreign power. It appears I might have been wrong. Considering the recent actions of our elected officials, the term …”domestic”, found in the oath I took, has taken on a new and rather frightening meaning. Is it even remotely possible our government is preparing for some type of action against American citizens?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Questions must be asked and answers demanded from those we elected to represent us. As for me, I recall and stand by my oath and will not tolerate attempts to deprive me of my rights. I have decided I’m to old to run and to proud to bow down, therefore I must defend. I hope I have some company. ΜΟΛΩΝ ΛΑΒΕ</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I WILL NOT REGISTER my arms, I WILL NOT REGISTER my high capacity magazines, I WILL NOT SURRENDER my freedom! I WILL NOT! An “ARMED CITIZEN” is a “SAFE CITIZEN”!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">–<a href="../wp-content/uploads/2015/02/11ACR-330x225.png"><img alt="11ACR-330x225" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5223" height="225" src="../wp-content/uploads/2015/02/11ACR-330x225.png" width="330"/></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Cope Reynolds</strong> – Testimonial: The oath that I took (both times) was really nothing more than a formality to me. The “oath” is something that I was born with. It’s not like it was beat into me or that I heard it constantly as child, it was just there and always has been. I’m very proud to have raised my hand and voiced that oath but it was unnecessary. That was not the beginning of my loyalty.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The patriotism that courses through my veins is strong and is inherent, coming from a long line of pioneers and service members. The integrity and quality of many “oath-takers” today is appalling! They raise their hand, voice the words, but have no idea what they are repeating or why. The words have no lasting meaning to them and are NOT permanently etched into their hearts and souls as they should be.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I will testify to whoever reads this, before the Almighty God, that the oath has<br/>
always been and will forevermore, be indelibly inscribed into every fiber that holds my body together. I believe that the Constitution was written by divinely inspired men that were placed on this earth at that particular time, for that particular purpose. The oath is as much a part of the Gospel to me as the Gospel itself.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I, Cope Reynolds, do solemnly swear that I will support and defend the Constitution of the united States against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same; that I take this obligation freely, without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion; and that I will well and faithfully discharge the duties of the office on which I am about to enter. So help me God.</p>
<p>The last sentence of this oath is NOT optional!</p>

<p><strong>Montana Ron</strong> -Testimonial: Nine (9) years Honorable Service in U.S. Army — Military Police Corps.<br/>
E-7 ~ South KOREA 1950 ~ 1954 police action.</p>
<p>“OATHS HAVE NO LIMITATION” — until your dead..!</p>
<p>GODSPEED.</p>
<p>Salute,<br/>
Montana Ron</p>
<p>–<a href="https://www.oathkeepers.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/sergeant_sgt_rank_insignia.jpg"><img alt="sergeant_sgt_rank_insignia" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5407" height="400" src="https://www.oathkeepers.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/sergeant_sgt_rank_insignia.jpg" width="400"/></a><strong>Sgt. David J. Lichoff (Ret.)</strong>  –</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Testimonial: I took my first oath as a police officer in the summer of 1986. This was the beginning of my journey down the road of public service with the City of Norwalk, Ohio Police Department. It was the best career I could think of for me. I took another oath when I was promoted to the rank of Sergeant with my department.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The oath I took dealt with protecting the Constitution of the United States of America, the Constitution of the State of Ohio and to enforce the laws of the state and the ordinances of my city. The greatest honor I held in my oath, was to protect the unalienable rights granted to every person by the Constitution of both the United States and the State of Ohio. I never once thought of “crossing the line” in order to accomplish an arrest or to gather evidence for a case. Our God given rights were always first and foremost in my mind.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I trained many young officers and always tried to instill these beliefs in them, that they may never break their oath. God looked upon me with favor and protection and I am now happily retired. I might not be out on the streets anymore but I still hold fast to the oath I took. I will never assist anyone, at any time, or in any way or fashion, in depriving anyone of their right to be free and unmolested by our government or any individual. I placed my life in harms way to protect the innocent and I will still do the same today. We are the guardians of freedom, both now and for our future generations to come.</p>

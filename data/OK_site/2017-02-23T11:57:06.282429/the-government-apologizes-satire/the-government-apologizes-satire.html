<p>This is satire, but if our government was honest, it would be true.  Promise them everything, but give them only bread and circuses has been the usual mantra of governments since Roman times, (or perhaps longer). Governments never apologize, so we can rest assured that this is satire. – Shorty Dawkins, Associate Editor</p>

<p>“<strong>Dear Grandma and Grandad, thank you for making the valiant effort over these past decades to achieve a measure of self-reliance</strong> in your dotage and for allowing us jacks-in-office full use of your  savings in the meanwhile as both a means to fulfill our political  ambitions and as a way to act out our own economically-illiterate and  usually illiberal prejudices at the expense of you and yours.”</p>
<p>“<strong>Sadly, it transpires that we have not only wasted a goodly  part of your savings, but we have greatly added to the host of  irredeemable promises which we made to you</strong>, in the form of a  mountain of even more pressing pledges issued to the Biggest of Big Fish  in the financial markets. So that we do not entirely dissuade these  latter sophisticates from again indulging our follies at the earliest  opportunity, we shall now have to ask you to share – and thereby greatly  to reduce – their pain.”</p>
<p>“<strong>Be assured, however, that the loss for which you have my  heartfelt sympathy will patriotically ensure that we can continue to  live well beyond our means.</strong> In this way your sacrifice will see  to it that the least possible harm will come to any of us in the  political classes (a.k.a. the agents of your misfortune), to our army of  placemen, patronage-seekers, and dole-gatherers, or to our plutocratic  enablers for – as the IMF puts it – ‘…resources that would otherwise  have been paid out to creditors will have been retained [to] reduce  [our] overall financing needs.’ Nor will we have to suffer the indignity  of modifying our existing approach overmuch by actually only spending  money on the things for which you, in true democratic fashion, have  openly voted the taxes since – here let me cite those marvellous chaps  in Washington, once again – ‘resources could be efficiently employed to  allow for a less constraining adjustment path.’, i.e., to allow one  demanding as little fundamental ‘adjustment’ as possible.”</p>
<p>“<strong>I feel confident you will join me in looking forward with  some enthusiasm to the next, inevitable ‘reprofiling’, just as soon as  we can arrange to overspend enough to make one necessary once again.</strong> Should I have already laid down the heavy burden of selfless public  service by the time this comes about and gone instead to my just reward  as a highly-paid ‘consultant’ to a global investment bank, I would urge  you to give your full support to my successor, of whatever political  stripe he or she may be. In such an event, there will, of course, be  precious little different in the treatment you receive at the hands of  any of the mainstream parties as currently constituted”</p>
<p><strong>Yours Insincerely, The Minister of Finance<br/>
</strong></p>

<content:encoded>I had a puzzling  question about some things in some of your articles, it says a member can be basically forced out if they are given a felony. Any soldier can get a felony for disobeying an unlawful order by person of authority. In fact it doesn’t matter if its a soldier, or even a citizen, you can be given a felony by opinion in a court of law if deemed by the jury. I just want people to remember times of slavery when people were even hung for small little things. How does the council know the difference with this organization? I am curious cuz I want to join and I am an Air Force veteran. I have friends in the army too, that were chief master sergeants and they would have to tell their kernel sometimes when that was an unlawful order. Who was never convicted of anything but I try to follow his footsteps when holding the true law and the morals of a country. And you list examples of Nazi Germany, if US was to do such a thing like the Nazis I think there be many felons in the country so would you support them or would you take them out of your organization cuz they have a felony. I guess my next question is  in today’s society  if someone believes in God they can be considered  mentally ill because an atheist doesn’t believe in a thing  like that , when I believe most people do including me. I have witnessed firsthand people being diagnosed with mental illnesses because an atheist professional thinks it’s an illusion to believe in God, so they determine you are mentally ill.

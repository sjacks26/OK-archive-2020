<content:encoded>Do not forget that the greatest “brain washing” apparatus is the television with its subliminals and “events” created to dumb down the populace and make them complicit – since it was in the black and white stage.  Plus aids in the “surveillance” state we currently are experiencing.
<p>Then add to it the “cell phones”, why do you think Obama hands them out like candy?  They are also used with subliminals and surveillance, and WE pay for them to be used against us. </p>
<p>Well I don’t, which is frustrating to the people who call me as I need to actually be near my phone to hear it, not be summoned at any minute by anyone. Nor do I own a TV for decades. Guess what, there really is a life without them.  Nor do I use navigation equipment beyond map.</p>
<p>They, along with public education are the biggest tools to destroy us and dumb us down.  </p>
<p>So my question is this, what are YOU doing to re-re educate the people of Bradford, Pennsylvania, Potter County, PA , Mckean County, PA so that they start using their brains again?  BTW, it is VERY difficult to re educate as Oathkeepers can tell you.  But do not give up on them, for every person you “liberate” they will assist even if only small amounts to do the same.</p>
<p>God Bless and Good luck in your endeavors for our nation.</p>

<content:encoded>Bravo! Excellent post. I belong to an organization that is using Amendment V, that “demands” (according to SCJ Antonin Scalia) a Common Law Grand Jury, a citizens’ oversight of all public servants, elected or appointed, with the power to indict and prosecute those who are not faithful to their oath of office.  <a href="http://www.nationallibertyalliance.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.nationallibertyalliance.org</a>  The website has much educational material and we have already filed Writs of Mandamus in all 50 states.  It’s a legal, slow process; but we are growing.
<p>I would like to hear your comments on “demanding” that our governors not send any of our tax monies to the sewer of DC…stop the flow of money and get rid of this entire bunch of traitors and start over.  We, at NLA, have already engaged the county sheriffs as to their Constitutional duties to We The People as the highest law enforcement officer in their county.  Your thoughts?</p>

<content:encoded>Yes, and in places like Bradford, Pennsylvania where people have been inbreeding for years, the brain damage is becoming apparent through the ‘follow the government’ mentality that hypnotically most ‘white areas’ continue to follow. Potter County, PA , Mckean County, PA , these areas are dangerously dumb. They will be led easily down any path government officials want in any future contingency.

<content:encoded>Good article, but I disagree with one thing, “we have been ousted from that protected circle”
<p>We “ousted” ourselves.  </p>
<p>We did not have to give up the Militias, we still don’t. It was easier to let those who serve within our governments create a governmental professional law enforcement that now sprawls throughout our nation threatening us. So now we have a governmental professional law enforcement that is unlawful and unconstitutional that is being used against us, though some who serve within that group may not recognize that fact, which is THEIR own fault because they took the Oath and they were REQUIRED to understand it (that they make themselves traitors to the USA, the US Constitution, and the American people).</p>
<p>The Militia, like the Grand Jury, and the “Good Behaviour requirement for judges are OUR, “We the People of the United States” tools to correct those that serve.  Those tools do NOT belong to those that serve within our government.  The US Constitution itself makes it clear what is “Good Behaviour” for all judges;</p>
<p>The US Constitution assigns what all judges, state and federal, must do to be allowed to stay in a judicial position, they are:<br/>
Required to take, and keep an Oath(s), or a combined Oath.<br/>
Required to “support and defend” the US Constitution and all that is in Pursuance thereof it before the duties of the office they occupy.<br/>
Required to carry out the enumerated duties assigned to the judicial branch by the US Constitution in a constitutional manner.</p>
<p>That is “Good Behaviour” for judges.</p>
<p>The Militia is a people’s tool whose “boss” is the US Constitution and the Constitution of each state, no one serving within our governments UNLESS they are “Called into service”.</p>
<p>John Adams, A Defense of the Constitutions of the United States 475: “To suppose arms in the hands of citizens, to be used at individual discretion, except in private self-defense, or by partial orders of towns, countries or districts of a state, is to demolish every constitution, and lay the laws prostrate, so that liberty can be enjoyed by no man; it is a dissolution of the government. The fundamental law of the militia is, that it be created, directed and commanded by the laws, and ever for the support of the laws.”</p>
<p> Alexander Hamilton, The Federalist Papers 28: “The militia is a voluntary force not associated or under the control of the States except when called out; [when called into actual service] a permanent or long standing force would be entirely different in make-up and call.”</p>
<p>We are even to create and maintain our own weapons facilities because of the very things happening today happened within the past and the founders KNEW it as they were VERY educated.</p>
<p>George Washington: “A free people ought not only to be armed, but disciplined; to which end a uniform and well-digested plan is requisite; and their safety and interest require that they should promote such manufactories as tend to render them independent of others for essential, particularly military, supplies.”  </p>
<p>We did not have to believe the lies to keep us into wars that a little research would have shown the lies. We still don’t.  So now we have a standing military that is unlawful and unconstitutional that may be used against us. That too would be those that serves own fault, because they also took the Oath and were REQUIRED to understand it (that they make themselves traitors to the USA, the US Constitution, and the American people).</p>
<p>We do not/did not have to put up with Election Fraud that we all know is going on.  Nor did we have to let the UN invade us with troops multiple times to “ensure that our elections were ‘fair'”. </p>
<p>Those that worked or volunteered to assist with the Elections and either assisted with Election Fraud, or looked the other way – that is a governmental function and the US Constitution makes no distinction between who has to take, and KEEP, the Oath to support the US Constitution and all that is in Pursuance thereof it; “… and all executive and judicial Officers, both of the United States and of the several States, shall be bound by Oath or Affirmation, to support this Constitution”. “The word “all” is all inclusive meaning everyone who works, elected, contracts for, volunteers within our governments are REQUIRED from the Congress, president, janitor, cooks, drivers, law enforcement – state and federal to take and KEEP that Oath or commit at least one felony.</p>
<p>We do not, did not need to put up with corrupt “representatives” in ANY branch of our governments – state and federal, the tools are there for us to remove them as they always have been.</p>
<p>ETC.</p>
<p>All one has to realize is that the US Constitution is not only (basically) our government, but it is most definitely the blueprint for our Constitutional Republic (NOT a democracy) so it outlines not only what those who serve are allowed and forbidden, or forbidden except under specific put-into-writing circumstances, to do.  Guess what, it also says what WE do, and cannot do.  As does the Declaration of Independence and the writings of the framers and forefathers.</p>
<p>If you believe for one minute that they would allow what is going on today without taking CONSTITUTIONAL action against it, I disagree.  They died, bled, lost everything including family members so that we could LIVE the American experiment.</p>
<p>Why they are so intent on taking us down (Americans) is because we have shown the rest of the world it could be so, and so they were LOSING their power to the people they ruled.  </p>
<p>We never needed Wars of aggression, people came here by the tons exactly for that reason. Those that serve needed wars of aggression to counteract the US Constitution.  </p>
<p>They needed the American people dumb and pliable, the military and law enforcement the same.  Think I am wrong?  Then why take the US Constitution and our real heritage out of schools?  Why are the law enforcement not learning what their Oath means and requires of them, same for the UN (used to be the US) Military? </p>
<p>Being American, the USA, with everything that it means is the biggest danger the “elite” horse droppings ever faced and they know it.  </p>
<p>It is not our US military they fear, they control it.  Nor is it “law enforcement” as they are controlled also.  They had to take DECADES to re train Americans, and it still was NOT enough so they started importing people from tyrant countries because they ONLY UNDERSTAND A PERSON AS A RULER, NOT A DOCUMENT, A SUPREME LAW.</p>
<p>Want to defeat them?  Support and USE our laws against them.  Remove those who need removing.  Revamp from the ground up our elections.  Etc.</p>
<p>Quit behaving as if our supreme law does not exist because they are ALL sworn to it, and it is the crime of the highest order within our nation to work to destroy it while in a position of trust.  USE IT as it is meant to be used.  It is also OUR tool, not theirs.</p>
<p>Stay Safe and God Bless All!</p>

## Jason Bermas; Stewart Rhodes

Jason Bermas: [00:00:00] Big deal because people don't understand the Federal Emergency Management Agency doesn't want to have to show its force. They want you to come to them and beg them for their services. You know. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:00:09] If you don't need them what are they going to do then. 

Jason Bermas: [00:00:11] Exactly. Well then they have to show their force then they have to bring in either the National Guard who may have a problem with what they're doing. the U.S. Army who should have a problem with what they're doing. They may ship NATO forces. people don't understand, people from other countries, They're used to different rules, they're not going to have a problem busting into your door and saying get into the truck. So I don't think they want to show that force. I think that they want to gradually gut this economy so more and more people have to rely on the federal government for assistance and then eventually, Well we'll have these FEMA centers instead of just you know the social services, now you'll have a federal arm of this front. That's where I see this country going unfortunately, when they're telling the people that there's a 10 percent unemployment rate. And you can see with your own eyes it's at least double that. when they're using new terminology called double dip recession. I want to hear the term double dip recession I want to bust out into laughter. It's sick Laughter But it's laughter I'm saying to myself OK we're saying recession. We've been saying recession since 0 3. We've seen the economy go down down down down down in. the public you know pretty blind until late 0 7 early 0 8 when it really say we're going to have to give these guys billions of dollars even though it's trillions of dollars. And now you know again with up to 20 percent unemployment what is this country going to do other than suckle on the teat of federal government. Are we going to get some backbone. Are we going to step up or are we going to say that we want a constitution, a bill of rights. And how about some non-criminals on the Hill in Washington. We'll be back after this. It's the Info Warrior with Jason Bermas. We've got Stewart Rhodes with us. we'll take your calls on the other side. 

Jason Bermas: [00:01:40] It's the Info Warrior With Jason Bermas and I was just talking to Stewart Rhodes off the air. Oath Keepers .org? Oath Keepers dot org if you want to join if you're a military guy if you like with this man saying and you want to get more organized, if you want to find more like minded people. Oath Keepers. But we were talking about how a lot of what's happened is our own fault. I mean we've had it too good for too long. and I don't like to say that in the you know the population stabilization kind a way, that the globalists and the eugenicist say we've had it too good for too long we have to crash the economy. I'm saying we've had so much that we've allowed ourselves to be comfortable with the fact that we're no longer involved in our community and our society in general. We're comfortable with other people making decisions for us, with not being able to you know live without the help of really the consumer industry. I mean we were talking about how many people could grow a crisis garden if they had to. How many people if there was no power could live for a week or a month in their home. I mean how many people have these skills now. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:02:40] Well very very few. And as I said in the break our grandparents made it through the Great Depression in large part because they were still close to the land and still knew how to grow things. You know we don't even know what that concept is. You put stuff in the ground and it comes out with food. What is what is that, I thought food came from the supermarket. So we have abdicated our responsibility. There's no such thing as a free lunch. You know we allow, we we sit back and wait for professional police to secure us, professional firefighters put out fires, and professional military to to guard our liberty. And of course the answer of the founders to that age old question of who shall guard the guardians was that you and I should be our own guardians. In our own militia. we've let that atrophy. So we have no one to blame but ourselves for that part of the equation. That side of of our own our own laziness. 

Jason Bermas: [00:03:30] And it is laziness folks I know a lot of people out there don't want to hear it either. Even the people listening right now I would imagine my audience has got to be at least cut in half this week because it's the Super Bowl. I mean it is literally the most important day of the year for I'd say about 15 20 percent of Americans. I mean that is I don't think that's an exaggerated number What's that one out of five out of six. I couldn't go anywhere this week where I didn't see some kind of Super Bowl special or $10 pies or even people at the convenience store asking Who do you like saints or Colts you know is Manning going to do. I'm like I don't really even care. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:04:04] I don't even know who's playing. 

Jason Bermas: [00:04:06] I only know because I get a lot. Well first of all JONES Did the Super Bowl bet. I don't have a football team. I don't really like the NFL too much, I'm bad I'll watch UFC I know I watched UFC last night you asked me it is that I watched last night I don't know if you saw it. But that's all I've got is basically I watched that and I watch a bunch of the animated shows on television. And then aside from that I'm just glued to the propaganda over at CNN MSNBC Fox News. I'm not going to give any of them a pass because all of them will give you these little pieces and tidbits of truth. But overall the agenda is the same, you know pay your taxes to the bankers. Cybersecurity is here. Go through the body scanners. and you know just love your gods. I I long for a restoration of the Constitution and Bill of Rights. Most people say it's going to take a revolution. I'm not of that mindset. I would like to see a peaceful reformation of the Constitution and Bill of Rights. I would like to see people be held accountable for their crimes. I would like to see when I see a headline of Tim Geithner giving secret emails telling AIG not to say where the money went, be prosecuted I mean is that so far into the realm of insanity. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:05:16] Well it could be done but it's going to take time. And the problem is is that we might run out of time. And so that's why it is absolutely essential that people get themselves squared away, get their own family squared away, make sure they can live independently for a month two months you up to six months or a year. You need food storage. It's almost like if you talk about food stores somehow you're some kind of crackpot. Well used to be that people store of food in case of a famine. And so things can happen. if you're squared away in a strong community and things go sideways like an economic collapse. If you are able to to help each other you won't need FEMA, they'll have less an excuse to come in, as you were saying earlier. So take it upon yourself right now. don't cry and complain and bitch and moan at the government not doing what you want to do. You go do it right now. Make sure your neighbors are ready to go. Get to know your neighbors first of all. throw a big block party. Find out who the ex doctor is who the ex cop is. You know like the Sesame Street thing, you know these are the people who. go find out who are the people in your neighborhood, get to know them all, become friends and then go meet the cops, make sure you're friends with the police do. You're all in this together. Their families are right there in the local community. And that brings me to our new program, Family Safe. the whole point of that is Oath Keeper members will volunteer to be the host family for any current shooting police officer or military or firefighters family that during times of emergency. they don't worry about their own family. They can send, a current serving cop can send his or her family over to the retired cops house and they're going to be safe there. And we're also going to set up a mutual aid among Oath Keepers and part of this will be a ham radio network within each state. Also cross-state. 

Jason Bermas: [00:06:57] Well let's talk about that and I. Also want to talk about how you feel Veterans are being treated on their way back to United States from Iraq and Afghanistan. back. I'm joined by Stewart Rhodes of Oath Keepers dot org and during the break we were talking about some people in office who are you know patriots who are truly doing the right thing on the state level on the local level. You throw a couple those guys out there. 

Stewart Rhodes: Well the biggest example I can think of is Joel Boniec of Montana. There you got a guy who's a hunting guide, that's been his career all his life. First time state legislator, first time citizen legislator in the legislature in Montana. He is the author of the made in Montana gun bill and also was instrumental in getting the sovereignty resolution proposed as well in Montana. Stand up constitutionalist. he's part of the after effect of the Ron Paul revolution. He's a Ron Paul guy. And as I said during the break, he didn't even need campaign for liberty to get elected. Is vote, his neighbors did it. all he needed was local community and they knew he was honest had integrity. You cannot support anyone for office that doesn't have a knowledge of the Constitution. They don't know the Constitution forget it. That's criterion number one. If you don't know they can't defend it. But number two they got to have courage and integrity because knowledge without courage is useless. courage without Knowledge is useless. So you get a guy who's got both knowledge and courage and has demonstrated the courage. Don't listen what they say. Look at what they've done. Show me where in their life they've ever done something really stood up and do what was right even at a personal cost. That's the guy you want. and the best thing you can do is go find someone who doesn't want the office who doesn't want to be a politician. Go find that guy or gal and then talk to in the running. Prick their conscience about their duty to serve their country as a citizen legislator. That's what you want the person who wants it really bad is not the right one. 

Jason Bermas: [00:08:42] And you know the other thing we talked about people having in effect going to these town hall meetings and you were discussing a disgruntled veteran that got up before these people chewed the guy out got down on YouTube and hundreds of thousands of people have seen it. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:08:53] Right. David Hedrick in Washington state. and as far as I'm concerned a veteran has an obligation under his oath to speak out and call to the carpet anybody in political office who is violating their oath. call them on it. If they are violating their oath say hey wait a minute I don't care what the policy is a good idea or not. what's constitutional. if you're violating the Constitution. I'm going to call you on it's my duty as a veteran Still oath bound to point out when you're violating your oath. And if you will not obey your oath, I'm gonna replace you and the next election. And if I have to I'll run myself which is what David Hedrick is doing against that Congressman. 

Jason Bermas: [00:09:32] And there's never been a better time to do so. you feel in the air with shows like Jesse Ventura's getting on the air Alex Jones getting bigger than ever. People waking up at least partially to these tea parties and going out and saying yes we are being taxed to death. Nothing is changing for the better. Now is the time to take charge for the worse. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:09:50] No but here's here's the thing as soon as things get bad from the top down it's getting better from the bottom up.

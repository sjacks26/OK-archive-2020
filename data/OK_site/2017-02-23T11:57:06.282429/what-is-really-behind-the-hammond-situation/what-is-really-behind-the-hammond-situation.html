<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://www.oathkeepers.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/No-Agenda-21.jpg"><img alt="No Agenda 21" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-9470" height="225" src="https://www.oathkeepers.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/No-Agenda-21.jpg" width="330"/></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Hammonds have been harassed for many years. They have fought many legal battles; winning two, losing others. They are not alone in their battle to preserve their ranch and way of life. Hundreds, or thousands, of ranchers throughout the West, in particular, have fought similar battles, with most coming out on the losing end, as the forces of government agencies and departments have been brought to bear on them. Miners and those in the lumber industry have been harassed, and had their mines and lumber businesses either legislated out of existence, or, through the BLM and US Forest Service, taken by harassment.</p>
<p>Why? What is going on?</p>
<p><strong>Agenda 21, the Rio Conference and ICLEI</strong></p>
<p>Wikipedia describes Agent 21 this way:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Agenda 21 is a non-binding, voluntarily implemented action plan of the United Nations with regard to sustainable development.[1] It is a product of the Earth Summit (UN Conference on Environment and Development) held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in 1992. It is an action agenda for the UN, other multilateral organizations, and individual governments around the world that can be executed at local, national, and global levels. The “21” in Agenda 21 refers to the 21st Century. It has been affirmed and had a few modifications at subsequent UN conferences.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">George H.W. Bush was President when the Earth Summit, in Rio de Janeiro, occurred. He signed onto Agenda 21, which is called a “voluntary agreement”, and every President since Daddy Bush has signed onto it as well.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Agenda 21 is not a top down bureaucracy, as we have come to know them, but, a bottom up implementation of what is called “sustainable development initiatives” designed and put into action on a local level, but all carefully crafted at the top by the UN. An organization called the International Council for Local Environmental Initiatives (ICLEI), funded heavily by George Soros and other globalist organizations, spearheads local initiatives that are carefully crafted to appeal to the general population’s desire for a healthy environment. There is an ICLEI office in Bozeman, Montana, and no doubt one near you. The goal of Agenda 21 and ICLEI, is to depopulate the West, and turn it into a giant wilderness area, while pushing humans into giant mega-cities, where, incidentally, the human resources can be carefully and totally controlled.</p>
<p>Watch the Glenn Beck video below,  to begin to understand what Agenda 21 is all about.</p>

</div>
<p>–</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Hammonds, were harassed into giving the BLM the right of first refusal, if/when the Hammonds should ever sell their ranch. Why? To depopulate the West, just as most of the ranchers near the Bundy Ranch in Nevada were driven off their land. To stop the BLM and US Forest service from being used as the spear to drive the people off their land, Agenda 21 must be stopped. Find out if there is an ICLEI office near you, or if your local elected officials are listening to, and implementing ICLEI policies. Demand that your local elected officials listen to you, not ICLEI.</p>

<content:encoded>If you have absolute faih in Ammon Bundy not being an operative, and this whole thing not being a hoax, then I’m the one who’s not naive.

<content:encoded>I normalized the audio levels on the Shawna Cox Free Republic Interview to make it easier to hear what she is saying. You can listen to it here:<br/>

<content:encoded>The Feds could’ve shot up Lavoy’s truck with fragmentation ammo (same ammo used by Air Marshals) for affect. That would explain why no one was killed inside the truck.

<content:encoded>Yours is the best post I have seen on this site.  Thank you for saying this…it is what I have been thinking for some time.  The horrific persecution of the Hammonds, as well as LaVoy’s death, lay heavy on my heart.  The totalitarians won EVERYTHING and Liberty got NOTHING out of this.  While everybody is now obsessing about the videos and the interviews and theories about the ambush, the elder Mr. Hammond is still a political prisoner, spending his last years in a cell 800 miles from his family. And the terrorist feds are now sure they are free to do the same to whomever they choose to make an example of next. The weakness and equivocating and making of “statements” will cost us all heavily in the future.

<content:encoded>Did not post the first time, but I saved it.  Thinking the moderator will catch any duplicates:
<p>There is obviously no dashcam video of the shooting(after the breach of the barricade) due to the positioning of the vehicles, but there will be audio.  Presumably, there will be body cam from at least the state troopers.  The body is/will be turned over to the family for their own inspection or autopsy.  The truck will be given to the family after the investigation, per law.  </p>
<p>This will all be very well documented.  What is altered or what is not put in the public domain will be up for debate, but the truck and body will at some point be available for inspection.  Now if the feds released the worst video with no audio to get the militia to react, to bring out the statements, to incite people to take action that can’t easily be pulled back, knowing they had all the evidence; were to simply explain later that after further investigation they were able to release everything.  </p>
<p>Per Lavoy’s statements, his shoulder holster in the interview day’s earlier, and that picture perfect draw attempt(if it wasn’t intentional it still looked like a smooth, muscle memory move).  What if how they said it went down is true, explaining the lack of other casualties?  What if they are delaying the simple answers, making it convoluted on purpose?  Especially if the hotter heads prevailed and took action, what then?  </p>
<p>If they turn out to be able to present irrefutable evidence(possible at this point), what do they have to gain by releasing all of this, then discrediting any who made a stand based on a untrue martyr story, at the same time extinguishing the true martyr story.  How do you make someone you call a paranoid, crazy look paranoid and crazy to the American people this would be one way.  Maybe cap a few that take action, before you show you were telling the truth about something that no longer matters.</p>
<p> Get them to talk about it in a narrative that is not the narrative you fear, then destroy that narrative and never go back to the core issue.  It becomes about a felony stop shooting that a “bunch of them right wingers” got wrong and committed crimes because of.  Not a cowboys last stand(the nearly lost narrative).I’m just saying there are a lot of theories out there and this seems pretty plausible, and the most damaging. This would also take the least amount of coordination(something the feds don’t do well) as it fits FBI policy and would play out easily in their favor.  Looking close at that video, the officer with a not gun shaped object in his left appears to reach for his hip with his right hand at the time of the shooting.  This would explain the quick turnaround, if a taser hit his coat from a running man, but did not penetrate.  Look again in slow mo.  This, along with the other non lethal would make this a huge PR win for them if any conclusion is made before the family even released the autopsy.</p>

<content:encoded>One clue Smitty that you are way off course…..he was probably wearing thermal underwear, a t-shirt, a flannel shirt, plus his jacket. And you expect to see blood splatter? Also….that video does not appear to be thermal capable and to overlay thermal imaging is not going to give a true thermal image. The sniper has his weapon extended towards his back and Lavoy either feels the hit and reacts, with a cross draw of his weapon (which we need to know if that his how he carried his weapon) with his right hand reach to his left.
<p>Any blood pooling would be soaked up within his clothing.</p>
<p>As far as your theory the Bundy’s set the whole thing up as government operatives is about as naïve as the moon landing was a fake.</p>

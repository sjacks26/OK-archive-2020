<h3 style="text-align: center;">Parts &lt;<a href="../index.html?p=5999" target="_blank"><em>one</em></a>&gt; and &lt;<a href="../index.html?p=6282" target="_blank"><em>two</em></a>&gt; touched upon these basics:</h3>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>1) The fact that JADE HELM 2015 is an Unconventional Warfare exercise;</strong><br/>
<strong>2) The fact that UW includes PSYOP and Civil Affairs activity;</strong><br/>
<strong>3) The fact that Civil Affairs involves cultural anthropology and social study;</strong><br/>
<strong>4) The Army’s Unconventional Warfare listing of “INSTRUMENTS OF NATIONAL POWER”;</strong><br/>
<strong>5) The Globalists’ view of the “Impact of Global Political Awakening” (by we the little people);</strong><br/>
<strong>6) The economic effects of the military-industrial complex activity on the U.S. economy;</strong><br/>
<strong>7) The fact of complicity between the UN’s NGO operations such as Agenda-21 and government’s perceived need to control its population while Agenda-21 initiation is in process;</strong><br/>
<strong>8) Asymetric Warfare and its relation to Unconventional, Special, and Irregular Warfare;</strong><br/>
<strong>9) The creation of perpetual war by creating new enemies one after another;</strong><br/>
<strong>10) The military’s interface/merger with local police through DHS’ Fusion Centers;</strong><br/>
<strong>11) Social planners’ concerns and confronting problems which would occur if permanent peace were to break out;</strong><br/>
<strong>12) DHS profiling of American citizens, with help from SPLC;</strong><br/>
<strong>13) Government-sponsored false flag events, such as were proposed in the Northwoods Document of 1962 at the Pentagon;</strong><br/>
<strong>14) Mapping the Human Terrain and “Mastering The Human Domain”;</strong><br/>
<strong>15) Training scenarios targeting the Tea Party and/or Constitutionalist citizens.</strong></p>
<p><strong>In this installment we will look further into PSYOP and introduce a perspective called “MindWar”. Please recall my opening comments at the start of Part One — this is a letter from your editor, and is not to be taken as an official Oath Keepers assessment of JADE HELM 2015, nor a “call to action”. This is not a policy statement. This is simply a series designed to provide Oath Keepers members and friends with historic context, with some random but important oddities from America’s hidden history. I salute every member and friend who is willing to read long articles in this series. I hope every reader will feel the time taken was worth doing.<br/>

<p><strong>Thank you.</strong></p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Description:</strong> <em>A gold color metal and enamel device 1 1/8 inches (2.86cm) in width overall consisting of and radiating from central base a white enameled torch with seven tongues of red enameled flame between a gold quill on the left and a gold Samurai sword, point down, on the right surmounting a black enameled Torii Gate on a green enameled background, all above a gray enameled scroll bearing the inscription “Support By Truth” in gold letters.</em><br/>
<strong>Symbolism:</strong> <em>The torch, a symbol of enlightenment, with seven tongues of flame alludes to the 7th Psychological Operations Group and their basic mission. The torii refers to Okinawa, where the organization was originally activated and the present headquarters of the organization is located. The quill and sword representing the correlation between psychological operations and military achievement; the quill representing the power of ideas; the sword, in addition to representing military aspects of force, alludes to the fact that psychological operations are also a form of warfare. The sword, being a Katana, alludes to the fact that the operations of the Psychological Operations Group are centered in the Asian Theater. The colors black, gray and white refer to the color symbolism of black, gray and white propaganda. The green background or backing is the color used for Psychological Operations organizations.</em><br/>
<strong>Background:</strong> <em>The distinctive unit insignia was authorized on 15 Apr 1969.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">_____________________</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Be Not Deceived. MindWar is as old as the human race. Unfortunately, our military has in recent times discovered it as a “concept”, and MindWar is now subtly becoming an aspect of military “doctrine”. The U.S. Army will deny that, because there is no command within the entire Army embracing MindWar. Yet, as this article will show below, MindWar does exist, and does not exist — both — at one and the same time. </em> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">_________________________</p>
<p><strong>In 1980 a fluffy little document</strong> was circulated around various Army offices and commands. Drawn up by the 7th Psychological Operations Group, the now-infamous document was entitled <em><strong>“From PSYOP To MindWar: The Psychology of Victory”. </strong></em>One of the authors of the paper was proud enough of his work to expound upon MindWar in a book published in 2013 with the one-word title, MindWar. Here’s a pic.</p>
<p><a href="../wp-content/uploads/2015/05/MindWar.jpg"><img alt="MindWar" class="aligncenter wp-image-6421" height="283" src="../wp-content/uploads/2015/05/MindWar.jpg" width="220"/></a></p>
<p>That picture of the book is a study in <em>understatement</em>. You may buy the book at Amazon dot com. I bought the book, just to make sure that it is real, that a book entitled MindWar actually exists, and to see for myself that it was written by the man who guided the 1980 document to completion. And so I’ve proven to my own satisfaction that Michael Aquino was the primary author of “From PSYOP To MindWar” in 1980, and that he did indeed, in 2013, thirty-three years later, write a book expounding on the philosophy of MindWar. I hate that he made a buck on me, but I’ll get more than that buck’s net value back many times over by using both the paper and the book he wrote to show the characteristics of a misadventure in which the military has taken upon itself to target the mind of mankind. The old admonition holds true for all of us today — “<em>Know Thy Enemy</em>“. So I bought the book.</p>
<p>I must confess that this subject is too vast and extensive to fit neatly into one article, or even one book. As I asked readers to be patient in my first installment of this series, I must repeat that request here as well.  Some of the things I’ll note in this intsallment may not at first glance appear to be relevant. There are, however, subtle connections to our analysis of the importance and impact of the military exercise known as JADE HELM 2015. To give one an example, let’s start with this stunning performance. Pay close attention to the ending, because at the end of this we see a transcendent conceptualization which is an important meme for any mind reading here. Enjoy:</p>
<div class="video-container">

</div>
<p>Just as perspective is a primal prerequisite for perception, let us move toward a proper perspective from which to see MindWar by first mixing a bit of psychology into our study. Humor me please. Before we dive into this remarkable subject, let’s all just take three deep breaths, sitting up straight to the full and breathing deeply in through the nostrils; then exhaling out through the mouth, as exegetes of Kundalini Yoga might practice, but do it slowly, with deliberation and determination, that we may calm our own minds for a strengthening moment. We embrace our confidence in the rightness of all cherished goodness here in this crazy world. We are preparing ourselves to objectively look at some grave things, to face them squarely, to see past our conditioned perception, our habitual way of seeing life, and to come to know truly the nature of accumulated and centralized power — What that kind of power might look like when unleashed upon any citizenry — Even what the buildup to that kind of power might look like, how it would be constructed.</p>
<p>How, after all, does any NATIONAL POWER achieve total power over its tax base?</p>
<p>Let us center ourselves by focusing on the inherent goodness which indwells our individual human hearts. Three deep breaths, and then a smile, yes? Now, as Cyrellys puts it, let us “remember who we are”. And to set the perfect mood, let us now absorb a paragraph from one of America’s greatest 19th Century authors, Ralph Waldo Emerson:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>“I read the other day some verses written by an eminent painter which were original and not conventional. The soul always hears an admonition in such lines, let the subject be what it may. The sentiment they instil is of more value than any thought they may contain. To believe your own thought, to believe that what is true for you in your private heart is true for all men, – that is genius. Speak your latent conviction, and it shall be the universal sense; for the inmost in due time becomes the outmost,– and our first thought is rendered back to us by the trumpets of the Last Judgment. Familiar as the voice of the mind is to each, the highest merit we ascribe to Moses, Plato, and Milton is, that they set at naught books and traditions, and spoke not what men but what they thought. A man should learn to detect and watch that gleam of light which flashes across his mind from within, more than the lustre of the firmament of bards and sages. Yet he dismisses without notice his thought, because it is his. In every work of genius we recognize our own rejected thoughts: they come back to us with a certain alienated majesty. Great works of art have no more affecting lesson for us than this. They teach us to abide by our spontaneous impression with good-humored inflexibility then most when the whole cry of voices is on the other side. Else, to-morrow a stranger will say with masterly good sense precisely what we have thought and felt all the time, and we shall be forced to take with shame our own opinion from another.” –</em>–<a href="../emerson-self-reliance/index.html" target="_blank"><strong> Emerson, from his essay on Self-Reliance.</strong></a></p>
<p>Emerson mentioned “…<em>the voice of the mind</em>…”.  Self-knowledge begins with self-awareness of that “voice”, and awareness is itself a property of mentality, a process of the subjective mind. Like everything else in Psyche, awareness is invisible. Yet we all speak of awareness at times but seldom think about it. In other words, one seldom “thinks about thinking”, preferring to simply do one’s thinking without having to to be aware of it. We humans generally rely upon habitual thought processes, and perhaps a large percentage of modern populations prefer television and/or other forms of entertainment over contemplative exercises in our own private mentality. We seldom ponder questions about the mind, consciousness, perception, knowledge, memory, emotions, or awareness.</p>
<p>For example, philosophy has long sought answers for the question: Am I my thought, or am I the observer of my thought, or am I both or even more? If I can know something, and know that I know it, which is “me” — the known or the knower of the known? What is a thought? How is a thought different from an emotion? What is memory, where is it stored, how is it recalled from past experience or past knowledge into the present, *what* part of psyche recalls it, and how does that process actually work? Such are questions which I shall not attempt to answer in this series of articles on JADE HELM 2015, but which are indicators of something very important. I have to bring such things up, because this installment on JADE HELM 2015 is about MindWar. All such questions imply the existence of the “mind”, and the mind is now being targeted by forces representing a desire to control the content and functionality of every mind on earth. To Emerson’s sagely advice about fidelity to one’s own mind, we here in modern America now must also add a general defense in our presumed right to own one’s own mind.</p>
<p>To my view on that, I note that to ignore the significance of government’s openly-confessed intent to dominate everyone’s perception is but a personalized testament of any soul’s spiritual status, and the plight of another in his “Pilgrim’s Progress” is not pertinent to my own plight in life. Ye be Ye, and I’ll be me, and, <em>all willing</em>, we’ll both be free. But those who are interested in rising above the herd mentality of the habitual and rote conscious levels of the group mind, those who have a hope of enhancing spiritual qualities in one’s existence as a human being with a vibrant, living, and active mind, may step outside the social norm and realize that our dear government, including our tax-funded military, is now out to govern very private and personal attributes of our minds.</p>
<p>I have mirrored the paper from which the book named MindWar arose. Readers will find it &lt;<a href="../index.html?p=2900" target="_blank"><em><strong>here</strong></em></a>&gt;</p>
<p>Now let’s look into MindWar and see how it fits with this psycho-circus called JADE HELM 2015.</p>
<p>Let’s first note something which MindWar is not. To the best of my knowledge MindWar is not a division, not a unit, or a Command. No battalion or other such sub-group under the 7th Psy-Op Group’s command is assigned to develop or promote or execute MindWar, nor is it even an operational program of the U.S. Army.</p>
<p>MindWar, in that sense, is <em>not even a reality.</em></p>
<p>Instead, MindWar is more like an appending imagination. It is much like a mental template with which to overlay the perceptions of Psychological Soldiers, to whom I often refer as “PsyWarriors”.</p>
<p>But MindWar is *<em>something</em>*, because a PSYOP group wrote a paper about it and much later a book was published about it. In the world of ideation, the proto-concept of a thematic war on the mind of mankind has been created in an Army document. But can MindWar be “just an idea”, or can it be something more?</p>
<p>I believe I’ve figured it out. I now see MindWar as an “attitude”, a perception, and a dynamic perspective all rolled into one mind-set. It is a gargantuan <em>idea </em>with a quantum appetite. It is like an auto-transcendent metaphor. It is a psychegenic bit of mental flotsam which was injected into the military mindset of the U.S. Army, and has most likely spread across the full spectrum of the American military community. Like a psycho-virus it has spread into the U.S. military’s Unconventional Warfare surge toward NATIONAL POWER. It is the sort of development which can happen when a trusting nation tells its Department of Defense to make sure America is well defended, but then leaves the mechanism of war-making up to tight-mouthed brass who are helping an arms industry find markets and uses for their product. Generals at the Pentagon have a very narrow focus — they simply focus on how to best expand and improve and develop military capability. Of late, their enthusiasm to do just that appears to be quite remarkable. Because of that, corporate “interests” are very friendly with Pentagon Brass.</p>
<p>Thanks to massive corporate and governmental corruption, and massive media-borne psychological subterfuge, Defense development has taken a life of its own, and has grown so complex and multi-faceted that its original mission has long been forgotten, has been replaced with this incessant, insane drive for NATIONAL POWER world-wide. That of course plays right into the hands of the Technocrats of the one-world government idiocy, a fact which the good Generals apparently have overlooked (or perhaps, for some, deliberately ignored) in their zeal. Are the Joint Chiefs and upper echelons of Pentagonal prowess unwitting pawns — surrogates — for a more subtle but more hideous agenda being played out by the power-elite of the NWO? Generals like tanks and battlefield equipment, planes and ships, and all the peripherals which are produced by the military-industrial manufacturing base. Do the bankers who finance the businesses which manufacture those toys for the military have a say in Federal budgets for “Defense”? Are those bankers and their corporate pals on Wall Street active on the NYSE? The Federal Reserve? The multitudinous fields of scientific inquiry, research, and development? Are they also active in the halls of Congress?  Do every one of them have an “interest” in war, even if it is only a war targeting<em> individuals</em> instead of nation-states, such as the current insane so-called  “War on Terrorism”? That is a good question.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">UW,  IW  and  MW</h2>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Unconventional Warfare and Irregular Warfare include and employ Psychological Operations. The legions of ISIS beheaders camped just across our Southern border are about to swarm all over America. In fact, the FBI now states that ISIS has terror cells in every State in the Union. We must be deathly afraid; we must fear ISIS Jihad; we must beg for our government to save us, even if it must also bring in foreign troops to ensure our safety. We must never believe that the too-big-to-jail banks at the Federal Reserve would ever knowingly implode the Federal Reserve system and throw this nation into chaos — only Terrorism could do that, so we must now become willing to give up our Constitution and its Bill of Rights to allow government to secure us. Police-state measures, military rule, state-of-emergency measures, rations, curfews, travel permits, relocations, indefinite detentions, and any other extreme measure must be allowed and even applauded. That is the essence of the message our government and its lap-sitting media would share with the American people. It’s a matter of perception, a state of mind, and each of us is now being targeted where it counts — in our own minds.  That Corbett Report video above pretty well says it all while showing how ISIS was created and why.  As we learned in part one of this series, the so-called “War on Terror” is a government creation and a massive deception. As such, it is a universally-applied PSYOP on behalf of governments everywhere and the corporate giants which own them, and the banks to which the multi-national corporations must dutifully bow.</p>
<p>Psychological Operations would target the “mind”, of course. So let’s talk about the mind first thing up.</p>
<p>There are two types of minds, two distinctly identifiable sorts of “mind”. There is your mind, which is the “<em>individual mind</em>“. Each of us, except perhaps the fools who work inside the Beltway, has one of those. Then there is the collective of everyone’s minds all rolled up into one, which is the “<em>group mind</em>“, or the “collective consciousness” of the human race, with a geo-specific magnetism proximal to each individual, subjectively. So we want to ask, <em>what</em> is the mind?</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://diplopi.wordpress.com/2013/09/17/does-consciousness-arise-from-quantum-processes-in-the-brain/" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'https://diplopi.wordpress.com/2013/09/17/does-consciousness-arise-from-quantum-processes-in-the-brain/', 'https://diplopi.wordpress.com/2013/09/17/does-consciousness-arise-from-quantum-processes-in-the-brain/');" target="_blank"><img alt="quantum computer_universal-mind-quantum-power" class="aligncenter wp-image-6852" height="375" src="../wp-content/uploads/2015/05/quantum-computer_universal-mind-quantum-power.jpg" width="750"/><em><strong>https://diplopi.wordpress.com/2013/09/17/does-consciousness-arise-from-quantum-processes-in-the-brain/</strong></em></a></p>
<p style="padding-left: 210px;"><strong><em>What is “Mind”? </em>No matter.</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 210px;"><strong><em>What is “Matter”? </em>Never mind.</strong></p>
<p>Like a gelatinous amorphous interminable blob of pulsating undulating vibratory mood-bearing electrically-charged omni-directional free-floating metamorphing mass of unconscious orb-yielding invisible electro-magnetic consciousness, the individual mind and the public mind may each be symbolized as a cohesive field of mental activity. We may call it the <em>Psyche</em>, the <em>personal psyche</em>, or the <em>collective psyche</em>, as recognized by PsyWarriors involved in planning “Psychological Operations”.</p>
<p>Psyche is readily metaphorized by an oceanic sea, in which an infinite variety of teeming fish and sea-life forms swim about. But in the Sea of Mind such creatures are metaphysical. They are not physical. They exist in our minds as thoughts, fears, emotions, attractions, ideas, memories, inspirations, motives, intuitions, dreams, wishes, associative connections, suggestions, hopes, and all that comes with Love and Love’s thought system. That which swims about in universal Psyche is as widely ranging in its forms as all which swim glide float and live in the multiplicity of the sea’s infinite possibilities of  the modalities of the expression and manifestation of The Being in varied forms ranging from the microscopic organism to the whale. The mind is the meta world, and it parallels precisely the physical manifestation of creation.</p>
<p>So in considering what MindWar might possibly be, we first must realize that every human being possessed of a mind is a potential target of whichever POWER might initiate MindWar. It’s generally seen to be a bore or a waste of time for most people to “<em>think about thinking”</em> while getting through our routine days and nights.</p>
<p>Our ability to think as individuals is itself under attack, as we shall see. We seldom think about what a thought is in actuality. But when one does think about it, one may notice that, like a physical life, a thought has a beginning, an arcing or over-arching field of extension across a span of its existence in the mind, and it has an <em>effect</em> somewhere, sometime, whether noticeable or not. One may notice that one’s thoughts are all formed from the memory banks in which one stores personal knowledge and all other experientially-gained understanding, everything one has learned. One “learns” the meanings of words as one learns to talk, and those learned understandings become part of one’s knowledge, the “known”, which becomes part of one’s personal past and is stored in one’s “memory”. Yet how many of us occasionally ponder just what that means? Which part of the self calls forth memory data from the subconscious memory banks in order to formulate and express an idea or describe a perception? Why is any of this important?</p>
<p>It is important because one may only know oneself through one’s mind. A man may think only with the mind. His thoughts are invented there, stored there, and either lead to direct action or are forgotten and buried in distant crimson corridors of all he has forgotten.</p>
<p>We each have a conscious “mind”, and all of our minds together create what Carl Jung dubbed to be the “collective consciousness” of the human race – well over [seven] billion individual minds registering the impulses and vibration-waves of”<em>delta, theta, alpha, or beta</em><br/>
<em>wave patterns”, </em>which are frequencies of vibration science now knows the brain emits – and all of those minds together constitute the collective mind of mankind. Specific to America, there are over three hundred million individual minds with each being a singular element in the sum total of all American minds.

<p>From page 36:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>“The conscious and intelligent manipulation of the organized habits and opinions of the masses is an important element in democratic society. Those who manipulate this unseen mechanism of society constitute an invisible government which is the true ruling power of our country. We are governed, our minds molded, our tastes formed, our ideas suggested, largely by men we have never heard of. This is a logical result of the way in which our democratic society is organized. Vast numbers of human beings must cooperate in this manner if they are to live together as a smoothly functioning society.”</em></p>
<p>From page 71:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>The systemic study of mass psychology revealed to students the potentialities of invisible government of society by manipulation of the motives which actuate man in the group. Trotter and Le Bon, who approached the subject in a scientific manner, and Graham Wallas, Walter Lippmann, and others who continued with searching studies of the group mind, established that the group has mental characteristics distinct from those of the individual, and is motivated by impulses and emotions which cannot be explained on the basis of what we know of individual psychology. So the question naturally arose: If we understand the mechanism and motives of the group mind, is it not possible to control and regiment the masses according to our will without their knowing about it?</em></p>
<p>We can know this about those who manipulate “<em>the unseen mechanism of society</em>” (the group mind) — that sort of person gravitates to Wall Street or Washington D.C. or other concentrations of power where their treachery has financial power or governmental power over other people. Some do it for profit, others do it for power.  Neither of them could do it to the individual mind, to your mind or to my mind, but they have known for a Century that they can do it to the mass mind, and the individual minds which comprise that group mind can be intimidated from objecting, and in most cases individual minds seldom are aware that they are being manipulated. As Bernays confessed above, when it is done <em>correctly</em> the individual mind does not even know that it has been manipulated.</p>
<p>Each of us has a mind, is a mind with physical extensions which we affectionately call “bodies”. While the body is confined in its three-dimensional Newtonian universe, the mind is not. The body is physical, the mind is meta-physical. Your body is supposed to be <em>your</em> body, not anyone else’s. Your mind is supposed to be<em> your</em> mind, and not anyone else’s. Our Constitution was written in such a way as to protect each citizen’s right to own his body and to own his mind.</p>
<p>America’s founders felt that “<a href="../declaration-of-independence/index.html" target="_blank"><em><strong>Nature or Nature’s God</strong></em></a>” provided each man or woman born on earth with certain “unalienable rights” which are not subject to any man-made “authority”. They wrote the Constitution specifically to protect those unalienable rights for each individual man or woman in the united States of America. That is where matters stood when our dearly-beloved government was created and commissioned to serve We The People.</p>
<p>Now, concerning JADE HELM 2015, it appears that our government has other notions. Of course the government’s intent to better serve We The People has morphed into a governmental attitude characterized by an incessant compulsion to <em>protect</em> us from ourselves, even if it has to impose a police state’s iron net of control over our entire population. The excuse for that is of course the constant barrage of news clips announcing that there is a terrorist behind every barn, bush, and building all over America. While there were no terrorists outside a hand-full of surrogates being farmed psychologically by FBI surveillance just ten years ago, suddenly an entire generation of “home-grown terrorists” are everywhere to be found, menacing every community in America, camped on our border(s) and preparing to deliver the knock-out punch with a massive terrorist event which only government can prevent. And to prevent just that the forces of NATIONAL POWER will have to set the Constitution and our Bill of Rights aside by intruding militarily into our very communities, towns, cities and States.</p>
<p>The intent of NATIONAL POWER is so alarming that even this Left Gate Keeper is horrified, even by a Democrat President:</p>
<div class="video-container">
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="615" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HkSkQgnEV-Q?rel=0" width="820"></iframe>
</div>
<p>This has progressed and developed as a trend in government in ways which are not new, but are a bit more blatantly obvious than in previous years. The concentration, empowerment, and growth of NATIONAL POWER has progressed to the point that to carry it any further our dear government must take off its mask, remove its benevolent glove and reveal its iron fist. That is where the militarization of our local police comes into play, as well as domestic military “assistance”. Part of how we have reached this point has to do with the public mind’s acceptance in our communities of a totally bogus and completely unlawful so-called “War on Drugs”. Government has used the war on drugs to create countless more enforcement jobs and assert an authoritarian power over our communities and homes. There are about seventy thousand SWAT raids in America each year, and most of those are targeting drug-related violations of statutes and codes.  Let’s watch what <a href="http://www.thedailybell.com/editorials/36264/John-Whitehead-Turning-America-into-a-Battlefield-A-Blueprint-for-Locking-Down-the-Nation/" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.thedailybell.com/editorials/36264/John-Whitehead-Turning-America-into-a-Battlefield-A-Blueprint-for-Locking-Down-the-Nation/', 'John Whitehead');" target="_blank"><em><strong>John Whitehead</strong></em></a> has to say about that.</p>

<p>With the so-called “War on Drugs” the government tested the American people and found that they would permit the Federal government to own their bodies, providing that the government put forth through the press and media a propaganda program which would be preached as if from pulpits based on moral indignation over one’s neighbor smoking a joint. In fact, after the government had failed at that game once before, by being forced to repeal “Prohibition” of the 1920s, Gov-worshippers were surprised to learn in the 1960s and ever since that the good tax-paying American citizens would even <em>pay</em> for the expansion of governmental power to control, regulate, and, in reality, to “own” our bodies. (Note: if any power can tell one what one may or may not put into one’s body, that power is asserting ownership over one’s body. There is no way to argue around that fact.) Ron Paul went into this phenomenon in his book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0446537527/ref=rdr_ext_tmb" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.amazon.com/dp/0446537527/ref=rdr_ext_tmb', 'The Revolution');" target="_blank"><strong>The Revolution</strong></a>. Government launched a massive PSYOP on the “American group mind”, and Christianity took the bait, never noticing the hook which would lead to current attacks on Christianity coming through the very government they had supported in its zealous efforts to own citizens’ bodies.  Remember this?</p>
<div class="video-container">
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="615" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/A-NX2tsJUaM?rel=0" width="820"></iframe>
</div>
<p>That is as good an example of government-sponsored propaganda as we’ll likely ever see. Wise citizens should always remember that the power over one’s neighbor which one supports is also a power over oneself. Anyone who can’t clearly see that today’s General government in WDC is trying to squash Christianity should pay more attention.</p>
<p>So the people proved that they would pay for the so-called War on Drugs, and the government was happy for that because it allowed government to create all sorts of jobs — Drug War enforcement <em>jobs</em>, so that now, with many decades having passed, every County in America may have a multi-jurisdictional para-militarized task force connected with the DEA which is operating under the Department of Justice (DOJ) which is now under the authority (spoken or unspoken) of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), or at least is in bed with it. That is one part of the infrastructure behind the mission of JADE HELM 2015, which is itself merely an extension of the greater MindWar.</p>
<p>Aquino’s paper’s title starts with the word “From”. “<em>From</em>” PSYOP to MindWar. That was to indicate a transition into something much bigger than merely dropping leaflets from airplanes or broadcasting clandestine radio messages to a targeted people. There is this from the document back in 1980:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Psychotronic research is in its infancy, but the U.S. Army already possesses an operational weapons systems designed to do what LTC Alexander would like ESP to do – except that this weapons system uses existing communications media. <strong>It seeks to map the minds of neutral and enemy individuals and then to change them in accordance with U.S. national interests.</strong> It does this on a wide scale, embracing military units, regions, nations, and blocs. In its present form it is called Psychological Operations (PSYOP). </em><strong>[Emphasis Elias Alias, editor]</strong><em><br/>
</em></p>
<p>Aquino was thinking big — big enough to see a possibility of changing minds on a world-wide scale. And remember — that was written in 1980, which was to the best of my knowledge well before the Army got into “Mapping the Human Terrain”.  Today the Army of course is also interested in mapping the human brain. The brain, after all, appears to be the seat of the mind, its focal center being the brain’s electro-magnetic force-field around which the personality hovers. As a cute little side note to illustrate my statement that the Army wants to map the human brain, let’s notice something DARPA posted a few years ago:</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>“…a novel technology which implements transcranial pulsed ultrasound to remotely and directly stimulate brain circuits without requiring surgery. Further, we have shown this ultrasonic neuromodulation approach confers a spatial resolution approximately five times greater than TMS and can exert its effects upon subcortical brain circuits deep within the brain….</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>“Through a recent grant made by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Young Faculty Award Program, our research will begin undergoing the next phases of research and development aimed towards engineering future applications using this neurotechnology for our country’s warfighters. Here, we will continue exploring the influence of ultrasound on brain function and begin using transducer phased arrays to examine the influence of focused ultrasound on intact brain circuits. We will also be investigating the use of capacitive micromachined ultrasonic transducers (CMUTs) for use in brain stimulation. Finally, to improve upon spatial resolution, we will examine the use of acoustic metamaterials and hyperlenses to study how subdiffraction limited ultrasound influences brain wave activity patterns.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>“How can this technology be used to provide our nation’s Warfighters with strategic advantages? We have developed working and conceptual prototypes in which ballistic helmets can be fitted with ultrasound transducers and microcontroller devices to illustrate potential applications as shown below. We look forward to developing a close working relationship with DARPA and other Department of Defense and U.S. Intelligence Communities to bring some of these applications to fruition over the coming years depending on the most pressing needs of our country’s defense industries.”</em></p>
<p>They are saying that the future military helmet may be fitted with micro-wave command capabilities which would beam signals into the brain of the soldier. Push a button to relax after combat, or push another button to heighten the output of one’s Adrenal gland prior to going on patrol, right? Just another step along science’s complicit march toward fully robotized soldiers — and — just another step closer to the seat of the Soul of mankind. Tax dollars are funding this insanity on behalf of “defense industries”. The fact that DARPA actually will publish this sort of thing is itself indicative of the greater MindWar which is underwriting JADE HELM 2015. We are to accept this, because of course government is only <em>“here to help”</em>. Where that sort of science may lead is something we don’t even want to think about, I can assure anyone. In the hands of a government hell-bent on “peace keeping” here on American soil, the possibilities are horrifying, especially when one considers that the military is now interfaced with civilian law enforcement under the awning called DHS.</p>
<p>Any Empire worth its salt must interface its military with its domestic police, as we all know and history shows. DARPA helped set up the ad hoc relationship between the Pentagon and the Department of Justice (DOJ) even before there was a DHS, by merging our military with the DOJ. That’s right – DARPA geniuses confessed the following way back in 1997, four years before 9/11/2001….</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>In 1994 the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) and the U.S.   Department of Defense (DOD) entered into a cooperative agreement to develop technologies of value to both. This agreement, codified in a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) and signed by the Deputy Secretary of Defense and the Attorney General, formalized and focused a longstanding ad hoc relationship. To manage this technology development program and to direct its day-to-day activities, the MOU established a Joint Program Steering Group (JPSG) that would represent both departments and be staffed with members from several agencies…</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Part I: The Partnership Between Law Enforcement and the Military</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>The boundaries separating the functions of the law enforcement and military communities are clearly defined in law. The military’s function is to provide for the national defense, while Federal, State, and local law enforcement agencies maintain domestic tranquillity. [Sic] Although performing different functions, law enforcement and the military perform many of the same tasks. Both law enforcement and the military operate their own judicial, police, and prison systems. Within the limits set by law, civil law enforcement and the military communities work cooperatively…. Often law enforcement and the military may also participate in the same missions. Such interagency efforts include waging the <strong>war against drugs, countering terrorism</strong> and espionage, and providing disaster relief…</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>The potential benefits of a joint development program became clear to officials in DOD and DOJ, as well as to Congress, in 1993. The overlap of technology needs had been noted by a senior working group (SWG) convened by DARPA in 1993 to assist in formulating a program to develop technologies to enhance the effectiveness of U.S. forces engaged in <strong>Operations Other Than War (OOTW)</strong>. These kinds of operations involve providing humanitarian assistance, <strong>peacekeeping, countering the flow of drugs into the United States, and countering terrorism.</strong> This initiative was prompted by events in Somalia and elsewhere. <strong>The SWG and DARPA noted many common technology needs between civilian law enforcement operations and OOTW.</strong> [emphasis EA]</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Congress and senior officials in both DOJ and DOD moved DARPA and NIJ toward establishing a formal partnership agreement. In June 1993, the Attorney General sent a letter to DOD and the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) suggesting collaboration on technology development. In July 1993, Congress initiated language directing the establishment of an interagency working group, which included DOJ and DOD, to look to the development of dual-use technologies. This was prompted by <strong>the recognition of the effect of defense downsizing on the industrial base and the effort to reduce Federal expenditures and by apparent interest within the administration to “reinvent government”</strong> by eliminating unnecessary redundancies. In hearings before the House Armed Services Committee’s Subcommittee on Research and Technology that year, the DOD Director of Defense Research and Engineering endorsed establishing joint technology development with DOJ…<br/>
</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Memorandum of Understanding. The clear benefits of this partnership led to the execution of an MOU between DOJ and DOD on April 20, 1994. Highlighting the importance attached to this MOU was its<strong> execution by the Attorney General and the Deputy Secretary of Defense</strong> and the <strong>presence</strong> of the Vice President, the Secretary of the Treasury, and the Director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy at the signing ceremony. This MOU set in motion the development and enactment of the technology program described in Part II of this report.</em></p>
<p><strong>[Interjection by Elias</strong> – Please note that an unlawful merging of the Justice Department and the U.S. Military was enacted at this juncture and was officially presided over by the Vice President as well as representatives of the Treasury Department and the Office of National Drug Control Policy. All were busy little boys under a Democratic administration; all preparing the way for the idiocy of the Republican Bush-43 administration. Also note that this sub-authority grouping of government officials did not include the U.S. Congress. Was a law passed in Congress to permit this? Was any Constitutional authority cited? Was the public mind advised of this before the fact? Did any case regarding this merging of two diametrically opposed bodies, one civil and the other military, DOJ and DOD, ever arise before the Supreme Court, which would undoubtedly have condemned this mischief? I think not. They just did it in the same off-hand way that NORTHCOM recently merged the U.S. Northern Command with the Canadian military. See:</p>

<p>Further, I would like to note that when I found this document some years ago it marked the first time I heard about “OOTW”. I must ask the reader — Where in the name of Hell did our military come up with the idea of doing anything other than war? Recall, in part one of this series on JADE HELM 2015 we noted that at the end of the Cold War (1989-1991) there was once again no “<em>enemy</em>“. I’ll ask the question: Was this diversion of the duties of our military into “peace-keeping”, “civil assistance”, “drug interdiction”, and the upcoming, planned, “war on terror” an initial step toward conditioning the military and the American people for “Operations Other Than War” as a proper and fitting use of what the Founders dubbed “a standing army”? The wisdom of our Founders shines through now, after all, yes? Give a standing army a little bit of power and it may go berserk. Add a pinch of fiat-printed money and and stir in some black budget funding for some basic government-sponsored black-ops, for seasoning, and we get a stew nobody really wants to swallow, but it’s being stuffed down our throats anyway by the might of a centralized insane government that values its own corrupted existence and NATIONAL POWER more than the glory, dignity, and moral justness embedded in its own founding legal documents.<strong>]</strong></p>
<p><strong>– Continuing with the DARPA report:</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>The MOU calls for the establishment of an extendable 5-year program in which a JPSG, jointly staffed by DOD and DOJ representatives, manages daily operations and a high-level interagency Senior Review Group sets policy. Members of the JPSG have been drawn from DARPA, NIJ, the FBI, the Bureau of Prisons, and the U.S. Army. The JPSG works at any point along the research, development, and acquisition (RDA) spectrum so that it can support demonstrations of existing technology as well as development of totally new and unique technologies.</em></p>
<p><strong>– End quote from 1997 NCJRS  report. Read the whole thing at above link. –</strong></p>
<p><em> </em>When the report mentions that JPSG works at any point along the research, development, and acquisition spectrum, it created the capability of the military and civil law enforcement communities to interchange equipment, technology, science, and logistics, which explains how it came to be that SWAT teams now dash about sporting amazing militarized toys such as MRAPs and Sound Weapons etc. While viewing this older piece in which Luke Rudkowski shines, remember that what the police were “protecting” by shutting down the protesters was a meeting of the G-20, which announced at the end of their meeting that the U.S. Dollar would have to become just one of several currencies in a “basket” of currencies, and no longer be the world’s reserve currency — a globalist dream which is a nightmare for American sovereignty. While those subversive “dignitaries” were doing their dirty work the police were trampling the citizens’ rights to peacefully assemble and redress grievances:</p>

<p><strong>Recall,</strong> this kind of militarization of our police would officially begin in 1994, simply because a group of<em> ‘visionaries’ </em>decided to bypass Congress and the American people to build an infrastructure which would be occupied readily under COG (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuity_of_government" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuity_of_government', 'Continuity of Government');" target="_blank"><em><strong>Continuity of Government</strong></em></a>) or COOP (<a href="https://www.fema.gov/continuity-operations" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'https://www.fema.gov/continuity-operations', 'Continuity of Operations');" target="_blank"><em><strong>Continuity of Operations</strong></em></a>) under what General Tommy Franks dubbed “a military form of government”.</p>

<p>Those who have awakened and swam out of the eddies and pools of group-mind public deception gain the pain of clarity and with it comes the primal shriek of an attendant conscience. And perhaps that is part of what it’s all about, this thing called “MindWar”. A question carrying plenty of gravity would ask how America devolved into the situation in which we now have tangible evidence of police militarization, “inter-agency” training scenarios, Fusion Centers which are info-flow hubs sending signal Intel up-stream <em>to</em> DHS and downstream <em>from</em> DHS, liaison personnel interfacing military relationships with local law enforcement, a military domestic command on U.S. soil (NORTHCOM – Colorado), and all the other blessings of concentrated NATIONAL POWER, including some official perception necessitating the practicing by our military of Unconventional Warfare PSYOPs to “Master the Human Domain” on U.S. soil. But I digress… or do I?</p>
<p>I know that many readers here have already seen this video, but let’s offer it here for those who are not yet familiar with the author of the book on MindWar, Dr. Michael Aquino, now retired from the U.S. Army. This is the guy who worked in the 7th Psychological Operations Group in the Army, and dreamed up future developments for morphing basic PSYOP into MindWar.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Taking A Peek At MindWar</h2>
<p>Yes, it is two words run together, each capitalized only in its first letter, no space between. When we speak the term “MindWar”, we’re using a word created by two men, one of whom is retired US Army Colonel Michael Aquino.  (The other was Major Richard Sutter.) Here is the explanation for the origin of the word by the author of the book pictured above, Michael Aquino.  In a footnote on page 26 of his 2013 book entitled “MindWar”, Aquino says that he and Sutter had seen the movie Star Wars in 1977 and “<em>…we imagined a play on its name as a futuristic replacement for the bland Army term “Psychological Operations</em>”.</p>
<p>So Aquino and Sutter imagined the name MindWar as a catalyst to super-charging basic Army PSYOP just a few years after the American military got its butt handed to it by the communist forces of Viet Nam, China, and the USSR in April 1975.</p>
<p><a href="../wp-content/uploads/2015/05/VietNam_WashPost.jpg"><img alt="VietNam_WashPost" class="aligncenter wp-image-6549" height="544" src="../wp-content/uploads/2015/05/VietNam_WashPost.jpg" width="663"/></a></p>
<p>Aquino overlooked the fact that Ho Chi Minh fought against the Japanese <em>for us</em> in Viet Nam during WWII and that we broke our word to him in 1945. He also overlooked the fact that our involvement in Viet Nam was not a declared war and was therefore an illegal international war crime, which had much to do with the public perception. Also not noted by Aquino is the fact that after the French were kicked out of Viet Nam in 1954 our illustrious CIA flew into Laos and built a 30,000 + man clandestine army (just as they would later do in Afghanistan across the 1980s) and used that guerrilla army to invade China and North Viet Nam until 1964, approximately nine years, prior to President Johnson sending in uniformed ground troops in 1965. But Aquino feels that the Vietnamese PSYOP defeated the American PSYOP, and he further notes that the U.S. Army’s PSYOP failed to interdict communist PSYOP here in America.  He is saying that if only the American propaganda machinery had done a better job of pumping up public support for the war in Viet Nam the outcome would have been different. He puts it this way in page 3 of the document —</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong><em>“Better hardware is nice, but by itself it will change nothing if we do not win the war for the mind.”</em> </strong></p>
<p>So in part, Aquino’s paper was a sign that the Army was looking back to lessons which should be learned from Viet Nam, and his take is that it was to some degree or another a PSYOP failure, or, rather, a failure of military leadership to properly employ PSYOP, which in hindsight appears to Aquino necessitates an all-out dedication to total MindWar. To see it that way he relies on military logic untethered to societal or cultural values. But the military-scientific vision which underwrites his theory fails to take into account that the “mind” is first subject to the soul which animates it, and that deception cannot permanently insure the propaganda’s success when the whole war on which that propaganda is based is a lie, an orchestrated and media-rendered deception of the world’s collective consciousness, with emphasis on the American collective consciousness.</p>
<p>Did I say “deception”? That the Viet Nam war was based on a deception?</p>
<p>When the Army went into Southeast Asia to drive out the Japanese in World War II our military Intelligence (the OSS) sought Ho Chi Minh and established a working relationship with him and his guerrilla underground army. There were chummy meetings on everything from strategy to logistics, with a bit of U.S. material assistance thrown into the agreement to boot. Here is a fairly good article (with much less “white-wash” or “spin” than most) about how our OSS related with Ho Chi Minh and General Giap. The author teaches at the U.S. Naval Academy. Students of “hidden history” will want to collect the article at this url: <a href="http://www.historynet.com/ho-chi-minh-and-the-oss.htm" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.historynet.com/ho-chi-minh-and-the-oss.htm', 'http://www.historynet.com/ho-chi-minh-and-the-oss.htm');" target="_blank"><em><strong>http://www.historynet.com/ho-chi-minh-and-the-oss.htm</strong></em></a></p>

<div id="stcpDiv" style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Throughout most of World War II, the United States was finding and supporting allies in China and other Southeast Asian regions, including French Indochina, to pose a threat to the Japanese military wherever possible. With the liberation of France in 1944, the U.S. government turned to its primary coordinator of intelligence during the war: the OSS, created in 1942 by President Franklin D. Roosevelt.OSS to Ho: Work With Us Against the Japanese. At the time, the OSS was operating a base in China’s wartime capital, Chungking. With the growing military complications in Indochina, Brig. Gen. William Donovan, the director of the OSS, instructed his staff to use “anyone who will work with us against the Japanese, but do not become involved in French-Indochinese politics.” The Viet Minh, a liberation movement that had emerged under Ho Chi Minh in the early 1940s, was seeking not only Vietnam’s independence from France, but also freedom from the Japanese occupation. In mid-1944 the OSS approached Ho to help organize an intelligence network in Indochina to help fight the Japanese and to help rescue downed American pilots. By then, “Ho had been cooperating with the Americans in propaganda activities,” wrote Captain Archimedes Patti, head of the OSS base in Kunming, China, and later Hanoi.The American association with Ho had actually begun in December 1942 when representatives of the Viet Minh approached the U.S. Embassy in China for help in securing the release of “an Annamite named Ho Chih-chi (?) [sic]” from a Nationalist Chinese prison, where he was being held for having invalid documents. In September 1943, when Ho was finally released, he returned to Vietnam to organize Vietnamese seeking independence. An October 1943 OSS memo proposed that the United States “use the Annamites…to immobilize large numbers of Japanese troops by conducting systematic guerrilla warfare in the difficult jungle country.” The missive went on to suggest the OSS’s most effective propaganda line was to “convince the Annamites that this war, if won by the Allies, will gain their independence.”</em></div>
<p> </p>
<p>What you just read is a part of our history which was not shared with U.S. troops twenty years later while training to invade Viet Nam in the mid-1960s. I joined the U.S. Marine Corps in 1965 and was never told about Ho Chi Minh having worked with U.S. forces against the Japanese in WWII. Why was that part of our history not revealed to the American people? Because, I surmise, it would contradict the purpose of 1960s U.S. propaganda programs which were employed to enlist public support for sending our ground troops into Viet Nam. And it would undermine confidence in our Intelligence community if the public were to understand that we had lied to an ally, deceived him, and deceived the American people. A bit more from that article, to gain more perspective on Dr. Aquino’s theory regarding MindWar —</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><strong>Deer Team Begins Training the Viet Minh</strong></em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Captain Patti’s OSS group, the Deer Team, was established on May 16 and made its way from the United States to the OSS station in Kunming, where it waited two months for permission to enter French Indochina…. The members of the Deer Team had to wait a couple of weeks for supply drops in early August before they could start small-arms and weapons training for the guerrilla forces. Once the arms arrived, the Americans showed the Viet Minh (most were recently civilians) how to fire the American M-1 rifle and M-1 carbine, and how to use mortars, grenades, bazookas and machine guns. For training, they used U.S. Army field manuals, and focused on guerrilla warfare.</em></p>
<p> As a Viet Nam Veteran I look back on the fact that Americans helped Ho Chi Minh build his guerrilla army which would later kill 58,000 U.S. servicemen and women. How did that come to be? The key to understanding it is quoted above —  <strong><em>“…the OSS’s most effective propaganda line was to ‘convince the Annamites that this war, if won by the Allies, will gain their independence’.”</em></strong></p>
<p>Our government lied to Ho Chi Minh and led him to believe that if he helped U.S. forces kick the Japanese out of Indo-China then Viet Nam could achieve its own sovereignty, out from under French rule. When, in 1945 after the close of WWII, Ho Chi Minh appealed to the American President for Vietnamese sovereignty, our President ignored him.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>In the years that followed, Ho Chi Minh continued to write letters of a diplomatic nature to President Harry Truman, asking for U.S. aid, but the letters were never answered. Ho didn’t break with the United States until the Americans gradually became involved with the French in working against the Vietnamese in the 1950s.</em></p>
<p>That was when Ho Chi Minh turned to Russia and China to help fund his growing guerrilla army against the French occupation. From 1945 to 1954, a period of nine years, the Viet Minh fought the French in Viet Nam and finally defeated them at Dien Bien Phu in 1954 when General Giap arrayed several full Divisions of Russian- and Chinese-supplied North Vietnamese Army (NVA) troops against a force of 13,000 French Foreign Legionaires there.  While the author of that article omits some minor facts which we’ll not go into in this article due to the need for brevity, I would like to offer some further conditions which Dr. Aquino does not mention in his From PSYOP To MindWar document.</p>
<p>After the French defeat and withdrawal from Viet Nam in ’54 our inexperienced CIA went into Laos and Cambodia, next door to Viet Nam, and built a 30,000-man clandestine army which would conduct military raids into China and North Viet Nam for the next nine years, until 1964 when the Gulf of Tonkin incident, now known to be a “false-flag pretext”, gave President Johnson his excuse to send in the Marines and begin a ten-year fiasco of immoral and criminal field-testing of tactics and products for the military-industrial complex. The American people had no way to know about that large clandestine army or its illegal raids into China and North Viet Nam until Victor Marchetti and John D. Marks published in 1974 their bombshell book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/CIA-Cult-Intelligence-Victor-Marchetti/dp/0394482395/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1433022206&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=Marchetti+and+Marks%2C+The+CIA+And+The+Cult+Of+Intelligence" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.amazon.com/CIA-Cult-Intelligence-Victor-Marchetti/dp/0394482395/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1433022206&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=Marchetti+and+Marks%2C+The+CIA+And+The+Cult+Of+Intelligence', 'The CIA And The Cult Of Intelligence');" target="_blank"><em><strong>The CIA And The Cult Of Intelligence</strong></em></a>.</p>
<p>So here and now we are looking at MindWar and we see that the document itself suggests that deception is a tool to be used. Further, we now can see that the American people were deceived in order to gain enough public support for invading Viet Nam with uniformed military troops. As I said above, the entire Viet Nam war was based on a deception, and trusting Americans in mass believed the government’s story. Those who saw through the ruse were tormented, beaten with police night-sticks, and some even shot to death. Remember the Kent State murders by soldiers? Any who opposed the Viet Nam war were demonized, ostracized, and even persecuted for objecting to the mass murder this government wreaked upon a tiny tropical Southeast Asian country which wanted its national sovereignty. I am an honorably-discharged U.S. Marine and Veteran of that insanity, and I have to live with perpetual guilt for what I helped a criminal government do to the American people and the Vietnamese people. I use the word guilt because the war was a massive psychological operation based on a fabulous lie about fighting communism <em>over there</em> so we wouldn’t have to fight communism <em>over here</em> on our own doorsteps. Remember that one? Aquino’s logic falls short —  PSYOP can only win the “battle for the mind” when PSYOP holds the moral high ground, which we never did in Viet Nam.  It is an old Intelligence concept our OSS inherited from British Intelligence during WWII which says that “the end justifies the means”. That delusion permeates the fifth floor at Langley to this very day, which is why CIA was running guns into Syria through Turkey from Benghazi.</p>
<p>Aquino also says: <strong><em>“That main effort cannot begin at the company or division level; it must originate at the national level. It must strengthen our national will to victory.”</em></strong></p>
<p>With that statement the document turns the will and might of military PSYOP onto the American public itself. The MindWar soldiers will understand why they must convince the American people that America will “win”, and a drive must be created in the mainstream media to influence the group mind that it wants victory, that it “wills” victory. This the Army even now seeks to execute as a part of PSYOP. As all who take time to read the MindWar document from 1980 will see, PsyWarriors working at CNN and FOX NEWS and all the other networks as well as at newspapers and other media/press vehicles, the American people are now a target of PSYOP. The group-mind meme is that America is the dominant force on the planet and will win every war she fights.   On page 7 we read:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"> <em>To this end MindWar must be strategic in emphasis, with tactical applications playing a reinforcing, supplementary role. In its strategic context, MindWar must reach out to friends, enemies, and neutrals alike across the globe – neither through primitive “battlefield” leaflets and loudspeakers of PSYOP nor through the weak, imprecise, and narrow effort of psychotronics – but through the media possessed by the United States which have the capabilities to reach virtually all people on the face of the Earth.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>These media are, of course, the electronic media – television and radio. State of the art developments in satellite communication, video recording techniques, and laser and optical transmission of broadcasts make possible a penetration of the minds of the world such as would have been inconceivable just a few years ago…</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em> MindWar must target all participants if it is to be effective. It must not only weaken the enemy; it must strengthen the United States. It strengthens the United States by denying enemy propaganda access to our people…</em></p>
<div class="video-container">
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="615" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/m1p-E2xmpjA?rel=0" width="820"></iframe>
</div>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"> <em>Under existing United States law, PSYOP units may not target American citizens.12</em><br/>
<em> That prohibition is based upon the presumption that “propaganda” is necessarily a lie or at</em><br/>
<em> least a misleading half-truth, and that the government has no right to lie to the people…</em></p>
<p> How’s that for a fluffy little pronouncement designed to reinforce the greater lie? He continues…</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>The theory behind “brainwashing” was that physical torture and deprivation would weaken the mind’s resistance to suggestion, and this was true to a point. But in the long run brainwashing does not work, because intelligent minds later realize their suggestibility under such</em> <em>conditions and therefore discount impressions and options inculcated accordingly. For the mind to believe in its own decisions, it must feel that it made those decisions without coercion. Coercive measures used by the operative, consequently, must not be </em><em>detectable by ordinary means…</em></p>
<p> In other words, MindWar cannot afford to permit the public to become aware that the people are being targeted with pro-policy messages. That is one dandy statement, and I can’t thank Aquino enough for letting that cat out of the bag. But by page 10 the document closes on a very remarkable note, with interesting footnotes. Here is a paragraph, which I’ll follow with the footnotes below it on page 10.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Existing PSYOP identifies purely-sociological factors which suggest appropriate</em> <em>idioms for messages. Doctrine in this area is highly developed, and the task is basically one</em> <em>of assembling and maintaining individuals and teams with enough expertise and experience</em> <em>to apply the doctrine effectively. This, however, is only the sociological dimension of target</em> <em>receptiveness measures. There are some purely natural conditions under which minds may </em><em>become more or less receptive to ideas, and MindWar should take full advantage of such phenomena as atmospheric electromagnetic activity19 , air ionization20 , and extremely low frequency waves21 .</em></p>
<p>Now for footnotes 19, 20, and 21:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><strong>19 Atmospheric electromagnetic (EM) activity:</strong> The Human body communicates internally by EM and</em><br/>
<em>electrochemical impulses. The EM field displayed in Kirlian photographs, the effectiveness of acupuncture,</em><br/>
<em>and the body’s physical responses to various types of EM radiation (X-rays, infrared radiation, visible light</em><br/>
<em>spectra, etc.) are all examples of human sensitivity to EM forces and fields. Atmospheric EM activity is</em><br/>
<em>regularly altered by such phenomena as sunspot eruptions and gravitational stresses which distort the</em><br/>
<em>Earth’s magnetic field. Under varying external EM conditions, humans are more or less disposed to the</em><br/>
<em>consideration of new ideas. MindWar should be timed accordingly. Per Dr. L.J. Ravitz:</em><br/>
<em>Electromagnetic field constructs add fuel to the assumption unifying living matter</em><br/>
<em>harmoniously with the operations of nature, the expression of an electromagnetic field no less</em><br/>
<em>than non-living systems; and that as points on spectrums, these two entities may at last take their</em><br/>
<em>positions in the organization of the universe in a way both explicable and rational … A tenable</em><br/>
<em>theory has been provided for emergence of the nervous system, developing not from functional</em><br/>
<em>demands, but instead deriving as a result of dynamic forces imposed on cell groups by the total</em><br/>
<em>field pattern. Living matter on </em>[sic]<em> has a definition of state based on relativity field physics, through</em><br/>
<em>which it has been possible to detect a measurable property of total state functions. (Ravitz, State-</em><br/>
<em>Function, Including Hypnotic States” in Journal of American Society of Psychosomatic</em><br/>
<em>Dentistry and Medicine, Vol. 17, No. 4, 1970.)</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><strong>20 Ionization of the air:</strong> An abundance of negative condensation nuclei (“air ions”) in ingested air</em><br/>
<em>enhances alertness and exhilaration, while an excess of positive ions enhances drowsiness and depression.</em><br/>
<em>Calculation of the ionic balance of a target audience’s atmospheric environment will be correspondingly</em><br/>
<em>useful. Again this is a naturally-occurring condition – caused by such varying agents as solar ultraviolet</em><br/>
<em>light, lightning, and rapidly-moving water – rather than one which most </em>[sic]<em> be artificially created. (Detonation</em><br/>
<em>of nuclear weapons, however, will alter atmospheric ionization levels.) Cf. Soyke, Fred and Edmonds, Alan,</em><br/>
<em>The Ion Effect. New York: E.P. Dutton, 1977.</em></p>
<p>And now my favorite —</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><strong>21 Extremely Low Frequency (ELF) waves:</strong> ELF waves up to 100 Hz are once more naturally occurring,</em><br/>
<em>but they can also be produced artificially (such as for the Navy’s Project Sanguine for submarine</em><br/>
<em>communication). ELF-waves are not normally noticed by the unaided senses, yet their resonant effect upon</em><br/>
<em>the human body has been connected to both physiological disorders and emotional distortion. Infrasound</em><br/>
<em>vibration (up to 20 Hz) can subliminally influence brain activity to align itself to delta, theta, alpha, or beta</em><br/>
<em>wave patterns, inclining an audience toward everything from alertness to passivity. Infrasound could be</em><br/>
<em>used tactically, as ELF-waves endure for great distances; and it could be used in conjunction with media</em><br/>
<em>broadcasts as well. See Playfair, Guy L. and Hill, Scott, The Cycles of Heaven. New York: St. Martin’s</em><br/>
<em>Press, 1978, pages 130-140.</em></p>
<p>So the science of ELF waves was known to the military as far back as 1980, and an officer in the 7th PSYOP Group let the cat out of the bag by including Playfair’s and Hill’s notation as a footnote at bottom of page 10 in his article.</p>
<p>Do you have a television set in your home? A smartphone? A computer? Is there a “smart meter” on your property? Ever hear of electro-magnetic pollution? How is your mind these days? How is the massive American collective consciousness these days? What condition is our condition in, eh?  Has our government, in its zeal to perfectly “secure” us all, decided to implement electro-magnetic influence on top of subliminal suggestion on top of overt advertising on top of outright propaganda on top of a pile of deceptions stacked up now for a full Century of governmental lying? What else can explain how our military can stand in public meetings and announce that it needs to practice Unconventional Warfare’s Irregular Warfare tactics of “mapping the human terrrain” on its way to “Mastering The Human Domain”? The whole shebang is pure nonsense, insanity, perversity-on-parade, and a clear and present danger to every living American.</p>

<p>Aquino and the Army’s PSYOP geniuses did not invent MindWar. Aquino just named it. Since then it has progressed in stages such as the military’s adoption of cultural Anthropology and other social sciences and even since at least as far back as 1962 the adoption of covert black-ops under the umbrella of PSYOP. However, a strong poet has penned some approximation of the state of the souls of the respective technocrats, statists, collectivists and their one-world government plans.  This is what Brzezinski and his pals, the Bush family, the Clinton family, and too many other nefarious miscreants to name here, have to look forward to in their last lament —</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>The soul has to stay where it is,</em><br/>
<em>Even though restless, hearing raindrops at the pane,</em><br/>
<em>The sighing of autumn leaves thrashed by the wind,</em><br/>
<em>Longing to be free, outside, but it must stay</em><br/>
<em>Posing in this place. It must move</em><br/>
<em>As little as possible. This is what the portrait says.</em><br/>
<em>But there is in that gaze a combination</em><br/>
<em>Of tenderness, amusement and regret, so powerful</em><br/>
<em>In its restraint that one cannot look for long.</em><br/>
<em>The secret is too plain. The pity of it smarts,</em><br/>
<em>Makes hot tears spurt: that the soul is not a soul,</em><br/>
<em>Has no secret, is small, and it fits</em><br/>
<em>Its hollow perfectly: its room, our moment of attention.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">— From the poem “<strong><a href="http://www.poemhunter.com/poem/self-portrait-in-a-convex-mirror/" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.poemhunter.com/poem/self-portrait-in-a-convex-mirror/', 'Self Portrait In A Convex Mirror');" target="_blank"><em>Self Portrait In A Convex Mirror</em></a>” by John Ashbery.</strong></p>
<p>The bigger secret behind MindWar is that MindWar has existed since the dawn of time, but never in earth’s history has any concentrated mass of power, such as the American Empire, had the means to so totally manipulate our perception, our consciousness, even our will power to resolve to own ourselves, to own our own minds.  Self ownership  is primary for all that is good about human life. Its opposite is slavery, in which some power or someone outside oneself owns one’s body, mind, and life — which is of course almost tantamount to owning one’s soul. By the time our scientists are seeking to use micro-wave signals from microwave transponders mounted inside military helmets to control brain functions in our soldiers, we perhaps should take that at face value and ask the hard questions. Has America given up her soul to to the forces of darkness, traded her birthright for a Statism which displaces God with Gov?</p>
<p>Dr. Aquino, like Zbigniew Brzezinski and David Rockefeller, most certainly have chosen a dark path, replacing their respective souls for the vanity of attempting to control all other souls. The mind is the seat of the soul, and the archetypal drives embraced by perverted egos manifest and reveal the will of all such men as sadly lacking in a real capacity to embrace properly the cognizance of Natural Creation, the principles behind the laws of Nature, the potential for true joy in life. All of that is sacrificed on the altar of darkness and is administered by nothing more than an unchecked ego. Intelligence is no safeguard against misinterpretation, as Brzezinski proves. He has a brilliant mind, but allowed it to be corrupted by fantasies shared by the international bankers and their flunkies over at the CFR and Trilateral Commission. We are all born here to die here. The state of one’s soul at the moment of death could be a very important matter, something worth thinking about as one makes one’s choices in life.</p>
<p>But be of good cheer. We who are awake on levels above the group mind can see all this and know it for what it is. Those who would control us and own us do not have a clue about the state of their respective souls. I began this installment of my JADE HELM 2015 series with some inspiring words by Emerson. You and I and our good neighbor can claim our heritage as moral Americans, and no matter what the forces of government would do we shall still be the masters of our own human souls, for we do not make bargains with the devil. We choose good over evil, Love over Fear. We are Americans, after all.</p>
<p>We have our culture. And we have Emerson:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Trust thyself: every heart vibrates to that iron string. Accept the place the divine providence has found for you, the society of your contemporaries, the connection of events. Great men have always done so, and confided themselves childlike to the genius of their age, betraying their perception that the absolutely trustworthy was seated at their heart, working through their hands, predominating in all their being. And we are now men, and must accept in the highest mind the same transcendent destiny; and not minors and invalids in a protected corner, not cowards fleeing before a revolution, but guides, redeemers, and benefactors, obeying the Almighty effort, and advancing on Chaos and the Dark.</em></p>
<p>Thank you for reading. In the next installment we’ll look into Main Core and some of the technology which can channel ELF waves and other invisible barbs to an unwitting national collective consciousness in the ongoing march of MindWar. Main Core shall, of course, lead us into Quantum Computing, where we will finally see how all the dots connect to produce the staggering portrait of what is really behind JADE HELM 2015 — Our government’s abuse of the word “Emergency”, COG, and Quantum Computers.</p>

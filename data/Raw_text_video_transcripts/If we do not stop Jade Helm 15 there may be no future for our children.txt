Hodges became political when McCain tried to steal every rural home in his area, including his. Became the spokesman for group. (2:02)

JVT: We live in historic times. You've been covering Jade Helm as long as we have. You have great information coming out. Real parallels between my info and your info. Things are getting scary. Contacts are saying Jade Helm is not an "if" but a "when" (0:02:50.4). You put out an article today about a Jade Helm red list. I have a contact wired into patriot & military communities, both, says that “they’re going to have a full collapse/police state this fall following by a night of the long knives, is going to occur on resistance leaders and to prepare accordingly” (0:03:57.0). Can you talk about the latest news you have?

DH: No specific time frame. When they do extractions of people they want to get out of the way, they’ll coordinate and use stealth, block comms (0:04:36.2). I know extractions are coming. Extractions always precede martial law (0:05:02.7). They’re looking for people who can organize, particularly militarily: COIN vets, military leadership with combat experience (including command officers Obama fired) (0:06:09.6). People like DH and JVT unlikely to be targeted first, they can just pull the plug on the internet; exception is people with extensive contacts. “I do expect some members of the media to be at the frontline of the extraction, but not most of them.” (0:06:58.0) I have good military contacts, so I’ll prob be targeted.
## By media, DH seems to mean patriot/militia “media”

DH: Key is to recognize when this is gonna come off. Evasion once stuff starts requires knowing the technology. If you can lead people into action, you’ll be a target, you’ll be in Phase 1. Most people will certainly be a Phase 2 target. All of us have a threat-matrix score from the NSA (0:08:17.9). Phase 2 will be just as deadly. Phase 2 is about mass relocation, sending people off to FEMA camps (0:08:50.2). Phase 2 happens pretty quickly after Phase 1, usually within a few days.
DH: Every source I talk to says the same thing: “this is gonna come down like a thief in the night” (0:09:12.4). They can’t give us time to react, it’s Shock and Awe.
DH: Mexican government documents prove there’s an ISIS base across the border from El Paso (0:09:32.2). Also, we’re on the verge of economic collapse. When the economy goes to pot, under that chaos, ISIS will begin targeted strikes (0:10:01.7). At the same time, we’ll see extractions. The government will try to trick you: hey come to our FEMA camp, we have food and water (0:10:12.6). That’s when the UN troops come in.

JVT: Some part of the US military, like Katrina, will participate in this. But the vast majority, I don’t know if they would be part of it, so foreign troops have to be part of it (0:10:30.9).

DH: 2 military sources, SpecFor vets, regularly talk to people involved in with Jade Helm, both say that Jade Helm leadership does not understand the operational nature of their mission (0:11:12.5). Some think it’s training for invading Kiev. Some think it’s martial law. But they’re guessing. Jade Helm is compartmentalized. Can’t tell the military they’re practicing for extractions and mass relocation, no one would buy into this (0:12:01.4). Most soldiers will follow orders, at least initially.

JVT: I have a nephew, 16 year vet of Marine Corps, he told me he isn’t going to participate in Jade Helm. Dropped his gear at the feet of his CO (0:13:06.2).

DH: A contact of one of my sources told us about an Army SOF document that talked about Jade Helm from last September. Talked about use of foreign troops (0:14:06.2). Document only came to light publicly 3 or 4 weeks ago, then only selectively. 
DH: Beware of false information. Can discredit you, then no one will believe you.
DH: I did external validity checks of the ArSOF document when I got it. Compared it to documents we know are about martial law like FM3-39.4 (0:14:56.9). It checked out. The document tells us they’re going to do surgical strikes using SOF. Doc written for SOF, not average soldier. What is a surgical strike? Going into a neighborhood to target 3 people is a surgical strike in this context (0:16:41.8). This isn’t just about kidnapping people and taking them to Guantanamo or a FEMA camp (0:16:52.1), this is about a death squad. They’re gonna go into homes and execute people, not just kill resistors (0:17:05.0).
DH: SOF might do this (rather than refuse) because they aren’t even told what their mission is until they’re on the chopper close to target (0:17:50.6).

## Break

DH: Best scenario: do what 3 counties in TX did: “raise so much heck” the military decides it’s not worth the trouble, they pull back (0:18:54.1). If we do that, for a short period of time, we’ll be safe. Of course, they’ll try to figure out another way to subjugate us.
DH: I’m not predicting that we’ll go into martial law by this fall, but I can see it happening (0:19:24.6). Once it starts, the only thing to stop it is civil war.
DH: Worst case scenario, which I believe will happen. Economic indicators are bad. Economic collapse is coming. Economic elites are prioritizing banks over people. Deposits aren’t safe. US Court ruled once you deposit money in the bank, it belongs to the bank (0:21:09.4). They’re planning to strip us of our assets.
## long explanation of connection between economic indicators, economic collapse, terrorism, and martial law
DH: ISIS will come across US-Mexico border. “They’re well-armed, they’re well-trained” (0:22:49.2). They’ve been trained by the same people that train drug cartels outside San Salvador. They’ve being trained with Muslim Brotherhood money. I believe ISIS is gonna lay siege to small towns: assassinate mayors, etc.
DH: Walmart closings (0:23:25.0). Two Texas cops (1 Texas Ranger, one high-up Dallas PD) said Walmart closings aren’t about FEMA processing. Walmart went on a military plan of logistical operations to match the military since Napolitano became DHS director. They’re closing Walmarts to “arm them to the teeth for supply” (0:24:09.6) against ISIS. Bracing for all hell to break loose. NPR attacked him for publicizing this.

JVT: Anytime we’re attacked – by Right Wing Watch or SPLC – we get new people following us. (0:25:33.1)

DH: I was talking to a FOX channel in Utah. Talking about Jade Helm, brought up ISIS, call got dropped. Called back, got me back after a few minutes, started talking again, got to ISIS again, call got dropped again. They tried to email me, call my cell phone, email and cell phone had been taken down until after midnight. “They” took down my comms when I was telling folks in Utah about government plans. Pretty clear indicator they’re worried about what I was saying.

JVT: I’ve experienced similar things. Certain guests on the show, communications seem to be messed with. (0:27:55.8)

DH: South Carolina police participated in Jade Helm drills (0:28:25.1). They did not do the extractions. When the red list group comes in to do extractions, police will cordon off neighborhood. That means if they don’t take you as part of the red list, they’ve already cordoned off the neighborhood. They’re gonna initiate martial law within 2 or 3 days, that’s typical throughout history (0:29:14.7), also what I’ve been told about this. “It’s gonna be under the guise of an economic collapse. It’s gonna be under the further guise of false-flag attacks by ISIS – and the CIA is funding ISIS” (0:30:02.1). Did a show where a source named names and bank account numbers of how the CIA is funding ISIS.
DH: When should you realize you’re in danger, drop everything, go dark?
DH: If you’re calling into these shows, if you’re commenting on websites, there’s a decent chance you’re on the blue list. (0:31:03.2) Anyone who is awake has left enough of a trail that the NSA has them on a list.
## Blue list is Phase 2
DH: Early indicator will be when the first bank closes and they do a bank holiday. When they do that, you should be where they can’t find you. Any time after that, they might come get you. Can’t say when, we haven’t seen this in America before.
DH: If you take your cell phone when you bug out, you’re dead meat. If your cellphone has been within 10 ft of another cellphone, the NSA knows and that’s a place they’ll look for you. (0:32:46.1)
DH: Remember, if you don’t buy into the koolaid you should be drinking, you’re a terrorist.
DH: Supercomputers record everything. If I walk into a room and say something and you’re there and your cellphone is off, it doesn’t matter. They’ll record it. When your phone is in passive mode, it’s recording everything around it. Humans don’t listen to it, but computers do it. They have everyone’s voice print. Doesn’t matter if the landline is off the hook. Doesn’t matter if the cellphone has the battery out. (0:34:46.4) If they have your voice print, they can match it to your location. Cars with Onstar, that’s worse than having your cellphone. FBI/NSA FAST system: FBI brags that they can find you if you’re hiding in the woods.

JVT: They have FLIR. How long would we realistically have to be off the grid? (0:35:57.5)

DH: Here’s the good news: if you help someone hide, it’s not gonna be a long-term deal. You leave because you know extractions and population movement is coming. Military is gonna make a choice. If a significant portion of the military and vets decide enough is enough, you’ve got a civil war (0:36:41.9). Once the civil war starts, extractions aren’t a concern. That’s not the problem. 
DH: Going after red list people in Jade Helm isn’t going to do any good, and you’re gonna make so many people mad, this thing is gonna blow up in their face. Jade Helm will cause civil war. (0:37:41.1).

JVT: People say this could happen this fall. You don’t put a timespan on it, smart, you never know when it could happen. Reaching enough people on alternative media could change the plan. I pray we are wrong on this. (0:38:13.3) This is gonna be the worst thing we’ve ever seen as a country, worse than the Civil War, worse than the Great Depression. There’s no doubt, it’s being engineered. We have intelligence that there are ISIS bases just over the border. Training camps in several states. Intelligence saying there are known ISIS members in every state. (0:38:47.9) We never hear about them being arrested. We always hear now about how it’s “the conservatives, it’s the Christians, it’s the gun owners and the veterans who are the real threat” (0:39:04.4). ISIS is a manufactured threat, but they’re already here. We have an open border, they’d be stupid not to be here. How does the ISIS aspect, the illegal immigrants from the southern border, how does that play into what’s gonna be happening?

DH: “First of all, illegal immigrants is a smoke screen” (0:39:43.0). ISIS, MS-13 coming over the border. Border Patrol officers during the immigration crisis last summer told me they weren’t allowed to hold MS-13 for any length of time: a day, wait until there were “5, 6, 7 of them” to release together (0:40:30.9). “So you had MS-13 cells actively being let into the country.” Judicial Watch has documents tying ISIS to Sinaloa cartel, using coyotes to get across. State Dept & PD documents saying Hamas and Hezbollah are involved with drug cartels (0:41:59.7). Drug cartels connected to Muslim Brotherhood through Hamas and Hezbollah connections. Side note: who runs arms and finance for the Muslim Brotherhood? President’s half-brother Malik Obama. Obama has never disavowed his brother’s actions.

DH: Source on ISIS-San Salvador connection is DEA agent. Expect him to go public in the next month (0:44:29.9). “We have a well-armed insurgency force inside the United States. We have a paramilitary force, at least one of them that we know of and there’s probably more, just outside El Paso, Texas” (0:44:58.5). They’re gonna attack malls, sporting events, schools. ISIS cuts the heads off Christian children, do you think they’re gonna hesitate to machine gun kids coming out of school?

DH: “If we can’t turn back Jade Helm through public pressure right now, your kids have no future, there is no America. This country will officially cease to exist. Our constitution is already dead. We don’t have a 1st Amendment… We have FM39.3 that we can execute you if you’re a protestor” (0:46:15.9)…. 2nd Amendment isn’t going well. Obama will someday “get his house-to-house.” When red lists and blue lists come, that will be de facto gun confiscation. 4th Amendment has been gone since TSA. 5th Amendment was done away with with the NDAA. “Should I go on?” The only freedoms we have left are driving to work, driving to go out to eat, and driving to see friends. Maybe it won’t be Jade Helm, but they’re practicing for something. “We are Jews and it’s Nazi Germany time” (0:47:34.5).

JVT: We’re seeing puzzle pieces fall into place. It’s happening before our eyes. How can we stop this? They’re gonna crash the economy, they’ve got the food supplies.

##DH is breaking up. Clears up after a minute.

DH: We’ve gotta expand our efforts. Jade Helm is in all 50 states, not the 7 states they claim. What do we do? All our attention and coverage gains us converts. ArSOF hear us, know what we’re saying. They might realize we’re right. “The more noise we make up front, the less committed of a force we will see from our own military and the more likely they will defect.” (0:51:06.9). “Our only chance in America… is to hide behind the conversion of our military. That’s it. That’s the only thing that’s gonna save the people of this country from an unimaginable nightmare.”

JVT: Do you think we’ll see economic collapse first? Riots? They’re getting us ready for a summer of unrest. 

DH: Economic collapse, failure of food, food shortages, food riots, stores will all be looted [## DH breaks up for a few seconds, completely unintelligible]. Economic collapse will come first. Might be a cyber attack on banks. I think it will be debt taking its course. (0:52:46.1) I think martial law is possible by September because the economy could collapse before then. Economic collapse, food riots, civil unrest, troops in the street, relocations because of ISIS. In 2012 DHS signed agreements with major sporting leagues and Simon [mall management] to serve as temporary refuges – they’ll be FEMA holding camps, they’ll be reeducation camps. We’re on the verge of seeing all these things happen.
DH: What could cause it to stop? If they think 30 million Americans will rise up and start shooting. People are already starting to stand up in Jade Helm areas. We could do this all across the country. We need to keep the pressure on.

## Rhodes on his show next week, before May 31

DH: Might have guests from South Africa, they claim white genocide is going on down there. (0:57:18.9).
DH: Dough [didn’t catch the last name] has a report of 15000 UN troops on a US base in Texas.
DH: Obama admin on behalf of the globalists are making their move against us. 

JVT: We’ve had Rhodes on the show more time than I can count. I embedded with Rhodes at the Bundy Ranch and at Sugar Pine Mine.

DH: We can no longer just discuss this amongst ourselves. We’ve got to talk to others, we’ve got to try to convert people. The only way they’ll back down is if they think they’ll face significant armed resistance.

JVT: We’ve gotta get past the race baiting and the stuff they’re doing to try to break us apart (1:04:57.8).

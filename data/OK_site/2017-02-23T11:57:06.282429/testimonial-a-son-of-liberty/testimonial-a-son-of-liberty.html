<p>Testimonial:  I am a United States Army Veteran. I was drafted during the Vietnam era. My father was a WWII veteran in the South Pacific. After Vietnam, I enrolled in college, and for the most part followed the liberal way of thinking. As I matured and took on the “Responsibility of a husband and father, my views of the direction in which the country was going in opened my eyes.</p>
<p>In 1993, US citizens were murdered in Waco Texas by the government. Presidents elected to this country started to work against the Republic. Our school children were dumbed down, criminals in this country started to have more rights than honest individuals. Liberalism ( a mental disorder ) was on the rise and I felt like everything was turning upside down. I then realized that the country I grew up in was NOT the same country I once believed in anymore. I started to read more, investigate web sites on the internet<br/>
and found out that my country was founded as a “Constitutional Republic” and not a “Democracy”. I read and found out that the ‘Federal Reserve” is not federal. I read about the global inner-circle, the ‘Illuminati” ( started in America on May 1st 1776 ). I learned that we lost our republic after the Civil War. I learned about our American flag and the American flag with the gold fringe on it and what it means. I learned about honor and integrity, and what it truly means to be an American.</p>
<p>If  Our founding fathers were alive today they would be sick to see the direction this nation is moving towards. The people that have been elected to office are all gangsters and traitors to the Republic. The question we must ask ourselves now, is what direction do ‘We the People” move towards? A great man once said over two hundred years ago, …What is it that gentlemen wish? What would they have? Is life so dear, or peace so sweet, as to be purchased at the price of chains and slavery? Forbid it Almighty God! I know not what course others may take; but as for me, give me liberty or give me death!</p>

<content:encoded>Decades and decades of subtle public school brainwashing, wussification, and remaining of Founding Fathers produced untold millions of identity-less “students” with no idea of who they are how, where, and when to proceed. Public schools drum into the heads of unsuspecting young people that they MUST go to college. That they MUST obtain a liberal arts degree…all the while these so-called untested and inexperienced graduates have been hornswaggled into believing their sheepskin automatically translates into millions or billions of dollars. Nothing is further from the truth. Nothing. It is a baldfaced lie!<br/>
Evangelicals have discarded the Bible for social relevance. The Gospel swapped for a ‘for a don’t offend anyone’ pulpit puppet. We dare not call anyone a sinner.  They might not come back to our church or social event.<br/>
Government is nearly the largest employer. Our leaders have become beholden to special interest groups. Common sense amongst our leaders was dispatched long ago. Elections are nothing more than popularity contests. Politicians have sex with interns; interns have sex with politicians with the hope they gain a government position; politicians steal; politicians lie; politicians have transitioned from public servants to expecting their constituents to serve them; politicians don’t think anything of spending taxpayer monies on extravagant (and wholly unneeded) trips and alleged fact-finding jaunts that are merely parties and drunken orgies. To be sure, there are some few who don’t subscribe to current socialist tendencies…but this severe minority is often portrayed as dissident and out-of-touch with ‘modern politics.’<br/>
And the journalist empire is complicit in our Nation’s slide toward utter destruction.<br/>
The ONLY hope for America is a return to Biblical principles and repentance before our Holy God.

<content:encoded>reading this reminded me a bit of my heritage, as my great great grandfather was I believe from Norway, which was also part of the vikign Scandanavia.
<p>as a result I take a lot of pride in a heritage of such illustrious history, and pride in the warrior mentality and skill of the Vikings, as well as the navigational ability they possessed at sea.</p>
<p>and while i’ll probably never sail in an ocean, I would love to stand and fight when the time comes with the same ferocity as my ancestors before. </p>
<p>that said… how in the hell could they allows themselves to become so demasculated!!! the viking men rowed boats for hours on end, and would land only to fight a battle afterword!! and usually win considering they almost wiped out all the Anglo Saxons! what is wrong with this country and it’s self loathing of it’s heritage!? it is a PROUD heritage!</p>

<content:encoded>You don’t need to cook it up yourself. Plenty of brands of Gun Oil on the market already that are made with pig fat. Here is one that many of the elite forces have been buying. They say it’s great stuff.    <a href="http://www.silverbulletgunoil.net/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.silverbulletgunoil.net/index.html</a>

<content:encoded>Yeah, it occurred to me a while back that hollow-point rounds have that nice li’l cavity in the bullet that would be the perfect carrier for bacon grease, or lard if you prefer…

<content:encoded>No Quarter – Song
<p>Alternate “No Quarter” lyrics…by Anon.</p>
<p>Based on lyrics and melody © 1999 by Catherine Faber<br/>
and the 1999 arrangement by Arlene “Callie” Hills<br/>
Original:  youtube.com/watch?v=aXxTB30lfv0<br/>
No Quarter – Alternate Lyrics flying the White Flag with Green Pine Tree…</p>
<p>America’s lost its champions; to God she has returned,<br/>
To stand before the Tester, in the state her rank has earned.<br/>
Our Lady needs an honor guard, an escort, and a crew,<br/>
And if you’re the best available, I guess you’ll have to do.<br/>
No Quarter, NO QUARTER! You damn well earned your fate.<br/>
Give Arlington our compliments; we’re sorry you are late.<br/>
Ancient legends say the rank a fallen warrior held<br/>
Depended on an Honor Guard of foes that one had felled.<br/>
And so in tardy tribute to the one we couldn’t save,<br/>
We’ll lay your fiery deaths like crimson flowers on her grave.<br/>
We know what Honor’s ending was, by all the tapes we viewed.<br/>
And now we reach the battle; we are in no gentle mood.<br/>
Hear that thunder rolling till it seems to split the sky?<br/>
That’s every ship in John Paul’s Navy taking up the cry–<br/>
The steadholder’s recruiting, so pray don’t surrender, sir.<br/>
Lady Liberty surrendered—once (9-11-2011) –and look what that got her!<br/>
We owe a debt of honor we have finally come to pay<br/>
And as we look you in the eye, we find one thing to say–<br/>
Put your arms in order, shine your boots and get them laced<br/>
You just might make the muster, but you don’t have time to waste,<br/>
For if you pass inspection and she deems you fit to serve,<br/>
You might yet meet an honor that you bastards don’t deserve. </p>
<p>It seems to be a law of nature, inflexible and inexorable, that those who will not risk cannot win. – John Paul Jones.</p>
<p>For the history of the Tree see:</p>
<p>Quote – In New Hampshire enforcement led to the Pine Tree Riot in 1772, where a statute had been in effect since 1722 protecting 12 inch diameter trees. After being fined and refusing to pay for possessing trees marked with the broad arrow, a New Hampshire mill owner leading other mill owners and townsmen assaulted the Sheriff and his Deputy sent to arrest him by giving him one lash with a tree switch for every tree which the mill owners were fined, cutting the ears, manes, and tails off their horses, and forced them out of town through a jeering crowd. This was one of the first acts of forceful protest against British policies. It occurred almost two years prior to the more well-known Boston Tea Party protest and three years before open hostilities began at the Battles of Lexington and Concord.[4]  — Wikipedia</p>
<p>For the history of the phrase:  Appeal to Heaven,</p>
<p>…the phrase connotes after a long continuance of unjust abuses of power by a government have been patiently suffered and all means of redress by earthly authority are ineffectual and exhausted, a People are left no alternative than to appeal to a morally just Supreme Judge for final adjudication and hopeful vindication of their cause through forcible resistance to achieve redress either through the acquiescence, alteration, or abolishment of the offending government. The People’s appeal is based upon the rectitude of their intentions (approving consciences), moral character capable of self-government, and justness of cause. – Wikipedia, also:  John Locke in Second Treatise on Civil Government, Thomas Jefferson in Declaration of Independence, John Milton’s The Tenure of Kings and Magistrates (1649) and Algernon Sidney’s Discourses Concerning Government (1698) as well as legally treated by British jurist Sir William Blackstone in Commentaries on the Laws of England (1765), Locke’s “An Appeal To Heaven” phrase succinctly connotes that it is Heaven who a People appeal to when forcible resistance is resorted to.</p>
<p>A spade is a spade…but today that’s not politically correct to say.  Either the public servants do their job or they’re fired.  As for the muzzie terrorists, if they go to do the two-step…NO QUARTER!</p>

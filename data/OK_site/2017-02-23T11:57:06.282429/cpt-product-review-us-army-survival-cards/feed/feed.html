<content:encoded>Would be interested in an OathKeepers product as well.  Maybe poison centers would be a valuable / viable source of info for plants and snakes?  
<p>Could create a revenue stream for OK.  </p>
<p>Appreciate what you are doing.</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>

<content:encoded>Katrina proved, “No one will help you.”<br/>
You must help yourself. Help your neighbors and community.<br/>
Any officials that show up will likely harm you. Not help.
<p>A friend of mine in New Orleans said Black Water contractors attempted to disarm him during Katrina FUBAR fiasco.<br/>
He claimed he said, “I don’t think so.”  Turned his back to them. Went inside his house and locked his door.<br/>
He said they yelled out to him to come out.  He ignored them. Went for more magazines. Not  “Sports Illustrated.”<br/>
The didn’t come up on porch.  They left.  </p>
<p>Good choice on their part.<br/>
He is lean Marine and mean.<br/>
He would not have gone peacefully.<br/>
A good role model.</p>

<content:encoded>Sounds like a plan. I hope someone at Oath Keepers is monitoring this so they can get ‘er done. I would certainly be interested and think it is an awesome idea.<br/>
Training videos on how to setup/organize a CPT.

<content:encoded>“Maybe this is an item that Oathkeepers.org could have OK version manufactured…”
<p>I think that sounds like a good way to get OK’s name out there on a very useful QUALITY product.</p>

<content:encoded>All well and good except for the OK Perception. Went 39 yrs without a Traffic Stop, until I placed an OK sticker on my SUV. Took it off as trouble was begging with it on, and NO I did not try to RTI the stopping officers…<br/>
Bought the Pin (very nice and yes worth the cost), but don’t wear it in the wrong places or all (heat) descends upon you. Yes in areas we may be liked and believed in, but fear those places where it is not the case, media has done its job, radicals are OK members no mater how you dress or present yourself.

<content:encoded>Congrats to you Stewart and to all OathKeepers for standing the test of time…
<p>Very well said by Stewart; all so wonderfully true.  The history of this nation is rich with the deepest meaning to the character of mankind.  So much has gone into its creation and continuation.  It’s history is firmly intertwined with the identity of humankind.  What each of you need to know is that was done just as deliberately as the opposition seeks to un-weave it.  There is a hidden history surrounding that intertwining to more firmly establish that identity, and its tangible outcome a nation inhabited by the heirs of what the family of Mannanan Mac Lir began in Cashel centuries ago.  This nations people are comprised of the values espoused by the Liberty Kings of old.  What you need to know most is that a nation is comprised of its PEOPLE not of any governance construct.  Those who believe a governance construct is the head and heart of a nation are sorely mistaken.</p>
<p>I have a friend who asked me recently some very deep questions about our people and our character.  He said some decades ago, during his active career (he was and still is an oath keeper), he had an opportunity to speak with an elder who had been involved in the OSS.  The course of the conversation took them to a discussion about the people of America (the discussion took place in Europe).  The elder gentleman, schooling my friend in conversation about our people and about the fears of the elite families who instigated both the creation of the Nazis AND the former Soviet Union experimenting with governance types, he asked my friend what he knew about the American people and why those particular elites feared them so.  My friend knowing when his listening is being tested, replied he didn’t know what the gentleman was asking.  The elderly former officer then pointed out that to him that there was a “bloodstock” powerful in nature residing throughout America.  He described a broad swath of the many places in the nation where it was highly concentrated.  I won’t go into the places my friend described to me as part of his asking me about what this gentleman was describing, because there is far more than genetics involved here.  What was being referred to was CULTURE, not genetics, but the fallibility of language meant using terminology that could at first glance cause one to make such an assumption.  The CULTURE being referred to was the CELTIC root stock of America.  Stewart ever so briefly touched on it mentioning the Irish song.  This root stock was neck deep from the first colony at Laconia to the American Revolution and the opening of the private libraries with painstakingly preserved documents, journals, and other books involving ideas that we now hold in our nations founding documents.  It even resides in a white flag with a green pine tree which was given as an initial flag for the ships of our first navy.</p>
<p>The elder gentleman told my friend that there had been two instances beyond the American Revolution that this ‘bloodstock’ had gathered in force to ‘save the world’.  Those instances were WWI and WWII.  My friend asked me about this gathering.  I said my grandmother had said something odd to me long ago when I was very young and I had just shrugged it off at the time thinking it was just another quaint story amid the many that exists in the Old Irish repertoire.  She said, “that in a time of dire need, you have the heritage and the ability to ‘call the Clanns'”  What she meant by this is metaphorical.  My grandmother had lived through both WWI and WWII.  She meant that what was done in those times, when the world truly needed the ancient heroes of old, they were ‘called’ and they rose to the occasion.  She meant that this could still be done.  You see she had been involved in the fight against the NWO of her day and she knew what we would face in OUR time.</p>
<p>So my friends and fellow OathKeepers, after long perusal of our paradigm, I echo her words and the words of that elder gentleman in Europe, and answer the deep questions of my friend who inquired about this very thing from me seeking the ancestral knowledge…</p>
<p>Yes that CULTURE still exists.  It exists in each and every one of you.  And we will see the day when the liberty leaders will stand and “Call the Clanns” once more to defend a world against tyranny.  And in this the Sleepers, the “Oldest of the Old’ will make the final step awakening from their slumber and the stories of the ancient liberty kings will be reborn in the modern sovereigns of America…</p>
<p>When that day comes, you all must remember who you are…sons and daughters of the ancient Sidhe who thousands of years ago fought against the ancestors of Illumined families in a global war against tyranny.</p>
<p>History repeats itself.  When the “Clanns” are called will you remember?  Will you rise?  </p>
<p>That is the question my friend asked me.  I told him you already had begun the process…the answer is YES.</p>
<p>Cyrellys ni Geibhendach do Dubhagain a child of the scribes of Feara Maighe who’s people immigrated to America in the Laconia Colony and after the American Revolution moved to the Pacific Northwest, then watched an ancient prophecy unfold.  It was a promise made thousands of years ago, carefully remembered and acted upon that helped a people choose an identity and build a nation…and now the heirs must for the sake of a world remember who they are and continue the story.</p>

<content:encoded>“…all that really matters is that we leave our children and grand-children free. Nothing else matters.”
<p>Thank you Stewart for bringing it home to the crux of it all.  May God Bless you and your family.</p>

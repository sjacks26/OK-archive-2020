<p><em>This article was written by Dr. Paul Craig Roberts and originally published at <a href="http://www.paulcraigroberts.org/" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.paulcraigroberts.org/', 'PaulCraigRoberts.org');">PaulCraigRoberts.org</a></em></p>
<p>Have you seen the economic recovery? I haven’t either. But it is  bound  to be around here somewhere, because the National Bureau of  Economic  Research spotted it in June 2009, four and one-half years ago.</p>
<p>It is a shy and reclusive recovery, like the “New Economy” and all  those  promised new economy jobs. I haven’t seen them either, but we  know they  are here, somewhere, because the economists said so.</p>
<p>Congress must have seen all those jobs before they went home for   Christmas, because our representatives let extended unemployment   benefits expire for 1.3 million unemployed Americans, who have not yet   met up with those new economy jobs, or even with an old economy job for   that matter.</p>
<p>By letting extended unemployment benefits expire,  Congress figures that  they saved 1.3 million Americans from becoming  lifelong bums of the  nanny state and living off the public purse. After  all, who do those  unemployed Americans think they are? A bank too big  to fail? The  military-security complex? Israel?</p>
<p><a name="more"></a>What the unemployed need to do is to form a lobby organization and make campaign contributions.</p>
<p>Just as economists don’t recognize facts that are inconsistent with   corporate grants, career ambitions, and being on the speaking circuit,   our representatives don’t recognize facts inconsistent with campaign   contributions.</p>
<p>For example, our representative in the White  House tells us that  ObamaCare is a worthy program even though those who  are supposed to be  helped by it aren’t because of large deductibles,  copays, and Medicaid  estate recovery. The cost of this non-help is a  doubling of the policy  premiums on those insured Americans who did not  need ObamaCare and the  reclassification by employers of workers’ jobs  from full-time to  part-time in order to avoid medical insurance costs.  All it took was  campaign contributions from the insurance industry to  turn a policy that  hurts most and helps none into a worthy program.  Worthy, of course, for  the insurance companies.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that it is the people who could not afford medical   insurance who have to come up with their part of the premium or pay a   penalty. How do people who have no discretionary income come up with   what are to them large sums of money? Are they going to eat less, drive   less, dress less? If so, what happens to people employed in those   industries when demand falls? Apparently, this was too big a thought for   the White House occupant, his economists, and our representatives in   Congress.</p>
<p>According to <a href="http://www.ssa.gov/cgi-bin/netcomp.cgi?year=2012" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.ssa.gov/cgi-bin/netcomp.cgi?year=2012', 'the official wage statistics for 2012');" target="_blank">the official wage statistics for 2012</a>,   forty percent of the US work force earned less than $20,000,   fifty-three percent earned less than $30,000, and seventy-three percent   earned less than $50,000. The median wage or salary was $27,519. The   amounts are in current dollars and they are compensation amounts subject   to state and federal income taxes and to Social Security and Medicare   payroll taxes. In other words, the take home pay is less.</p>
<p>To put these incomes into some perspective, the poverty threshold for a family of four in 2013 was $23,550.</p>
<p>In recent years, the only incomes that have been growing in real terms   are those few at the top of the income distribution. Those at the top   have benefited from “performance bonuses,” often acquired by laying off   workers or by replacing US workers with cheaper foreign labor, and from   the rise in stock and bond prices caused by the Federal Reserve’s  policy  of quantitative easing. Everyone else has experienced a decline  in real  income and wealth.</p>
<p>As only slightly more than one  percent of Americans make more than  $200,000 annually and less than  four-tenths of one percent make  $1,000,000 or more annually, there are  not enough people with  discretionary income to drive the economy with  consumer spending. When  real median family income and real per capita  income ceased to grow and  began falling, Federal Reserve chairman Alan  Greenspan substituted a  credit expansion to take the place of the  missing growth in income.  However, as consumers became loaded with  debt, it was no longer possible  to expand consumer spending with credit  expansion.</p>
<p>World War II left the US economy the only undamaged  industrial and  manufacturing center. Prosperity ensued. But by the  1970s the Keynesian  demand management economic policy had produced  stagflation. Reagan’s  supply-side policy was able to give the US  economy another 20 years. But  the collapse of the Soviet Union brought  an era of jobs offshoring to  large Asian economies that formerly were  closed to Western capital. Once  corporate executives realized that they  could earn multi-million dollar  performance bonuses by moving US jobs  abroad and once they were  threatened by Wall Street and shareholder  advocates with takeovers if  they did not, American capitalism began  giving the US economy to other  countries, mainly located in Asia. As  high productivity manufacturing  and professional service jobs (such as  software engineering) moved  offshore, US incomes stagnated and fell.</p>
<p>As  real income growth stagnated, wives entered the work force to   compensate. Children were educated by refinancing the home mortgage and   using the equity in the family home or with student loans that they do   not earn enough to repay. Since the December 2007 downturn, Americans   have used up their coping mechanisms. Homes have been refinanced. IRAs   raided. Savings drawn down. Grown children, now adults, are back home   with parents. The falling labor force participation rate signals that   the economy can no longer provide jobs for the workforce. In such a   situation, economic recovery is impossible.</p>
<p>What the Treasury  and Federal Reserve have done, with the complicity of  the White House,  Congress, economists, and the media, is to focus on  rescuing a half  dozen banks “too big to fail.” The consequence of  focusing economic  policy on saving the banks is rigged financial markets  and massive  stock and bond market bubbles. To protect the dollar’s  exchange value  from quantitative easing, the price of gold has been  forced down in the  paper futures market, with the consequence that  physical gold is  shipped to Asia where it is unavailable as a refuge for  Americans faced  with currency depreciation.</p>
<p>At a time when most Americans are  running out of coping mechanisms, the  US faces a possible financial  collapse and a high rate of inflation from  dollar depreciation as the  Fed pours out newly created money in an  effort to support the rigged  financial markets.</p>
<p>It remains to be seen whether the chickens can be kept from coming home to roost for another year.</p>

<content:encoded>Merry Christmas, Cal;<br/>
and thank you for all the great comments you’ve posted here at Oath Keepers.<br/>
Yes, it’s encouraging to see a judge do the right thing. What would be even better, in my opinion, would be a resolve in the hearts of every American to look within themselves for the ultimate sense of what is “right” or “wrong”, and stop relying on government offices (and officials) to declare what is right or wrong.<br/>
Example: As it goes with the First Amendment, so too it goes with the Second Amendment, which clearly outlaws all “gun control laws”, and so it is with many other facets of today’s societal norms — I was much older in life before I finally figured out that there is no lawful basis for requiring any law-abiding American citizen to buy a danged “permit” (such as “CCW”) to carry one’s armaments in any way one wishes. We The People are Constitutionally required to be the final arbiter on what the Second Amendment says and means — not some danged court or panel of judges. “Shall Not Be Infringed” means just that, and I, for one, am willing to stand on that as my “permit”. The judge in the above article is to be commended, for sure, but We The People should not depend on any judge to interpret the Constitution.
<p>Salute!<br/>

<content:encoded>Sorry Elias for taking so long to comment here.  It seems we rush to bad news, yet hold good news to our chest when not only we, but others need to see that light.
<p>Judge Kenneth Plotz deserves kudos for his constitutional action!  We should research other cases and see if this is a judge we want to replace those Domestic Enemies and Traitors currently serving within the Superior Courts, or elsewhere..</p>
<p>This was/is important, but to me, the courts do not lawfully decide what information people may hand out.  It is our natural right to inform others. But for many, it will mean the difference in their own actions so it is a VERY important decision by a judge that seems to know and back the US Constitution, and do his duty as assigned.  If so, then this is a great man when doing so surrounded by so much corruption.  If so, this judge’s name should become a household word that shows others that not all are corrupt.</p>

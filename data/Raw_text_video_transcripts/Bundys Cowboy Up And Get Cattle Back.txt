## First few seconds just talk about getting cows back

SR: (0:00:46.2) Are they gonna stop the rest of the roundup too?

MB: They’re done. The demands were demobilize and get out of here.

SR: And they said they would do that?

MB: (0:00:56.0) Well they did it. They’re out of here. They wanted to go. Those guys were scared shitless.

SR: No doubt. We’re worried that they’ll come back after everyone leaves.

MB: We’ll have a press conference later. We have to get all this figured out.

SR: Hey Sheriff Mack, here’s one of the sons right here. 

## RM & MB shake hands at 0:01:25.4

RM: Which one are you, Dave? Ammon?

MB: Mel. I’m one of the ones that didn’t get thrown down or tazed.

RM: Your dad and I have known each other a long time.

MB: Everyone said I’d be the first one. I’ve calmed down a lot, and they’re a lot dumber than I am. They deserved it.

RM: I just asked your mom and dad if we’re going to church tomorrow. I’ll be there with you guys. (0:01:53.8)

SR: What’s the current situation?

MB: The county’s now in control.

SR: The sheriff stepped up.

MB: We got rid of the BLM, sent them home with their tail between their legs.

RM: Your sure they’re gone?

MB: Yeah, they’re leaving (0:02:14.0), we’re getting our cows back.

UM1: For now, how long are they gone?

MB: They’re gone, okay? We’ve got the county on our back.

RM: So these are county vehicles out here?

MB: Yeah.

RM: Is Gillespie still here or is he gone?

MB: I’m sure he’s with my dad. 

SR: No he’s not, we were just there.

MB: His men are the authority here, representing the people of our county. They’re the good guys, I want everyone to shake their hand.

RM: See this organization? CSPOA. OK and I have been saying this is exactly what every sheriff in the country should be doing. I got really pissed off at him for not stepping up. (0:02:57.7)

MB: You know what, the people convinced him to stand up.

RM: We made it happen, yeah. 

MB: As far as them coming back, I aint scared of the boogeyman. If they do, we’ll do it again.

RM: We’ll be back, we got your back.

MB: Then we’re gonna go to Arizona and do it, to Utah and do it.

RM: Arizona legislators are coming up here to make sure they know that they won’t take them there (0:03:21.1).

MB: We got our cows back.

UM2: How about the 300 they took last week?

MB: There’s been a lot of rumors, but the BLM – they might have fudged the numbers – they had 277. I know they were gathering some more on the south end of the ranch.

RM: They haven’t taken them off the property?

MB: We don’t know that, I can’t say. There are cattle here, they might have shipped some.

RM: That’s what was reported.

MB: If they have, (0:03:51.1) my dad will demand that they return them today. Or whatever state or county they’re in, those county officers go arrest em all and seize those cattle and transport them back.

## [Someone off camera asks MB a question, I can’t hear it]

MB: They were gonna railroad all the way throw.

UM3: Need to charge those guys (0:04:16.0) that sicced the dog and tazed Ammon. They have to charge those guys.

MB: They will.

## MB rides away. Rhodes follows him with the camera, then pans to RM’s back, talking to a few others

UM4: I’m sure I’m gonna get audited by the IRS. They caught me on film right up by the gate saying “let em go!” (0:04:32.5)

UM4: It got really heated. (0:04:50.8) It got to the point that I called my wife. Someone had an AR-15 pointed at me, I had my hands out.

SR: Tell us what happened

UM4: We protested the sheriff’s department yesterday (0:05:10.9), demanding that he do what he was sworn to do, which is defend We the People, defend these ranchers. He came out today and said he was ordering BLM to vacate, to cease and desist. He did that in word only, there was no deed. He didn’t physically force them to leave, and they weren’t backing down. (0:05:35.6) One reporter came down by himself, they were fixing to take him into custody. We heard and ran from that median, slid down that hill, and charged this gate, demanding that they leave him alone and release those cows. They started to say they were gonna pepperball us, pointing pepperball guns at us. At that point, one of the Bundys made contact with a representative from the BLM and they reached a conclusion that we weren’t gonna back down. (0:06:11.3) Finally, the sheriff’s department physically got between us and the BLM and said this is not gonna end well, you need to back off, and finally they backed off. It wasn’t until the sheriff’s department stepped in, which is what the CSPOA is all about, we train our sheriffs that you’re the last line of defense between the citizens and tyrannical governments. (0:06:33.3) This has cost taxpayers thousands of dollars, this never had to get to this point. If he had upheld his oath, I’m telling everyone I talk to to start a recall petition for that sheriff. He’s not an oath keeper, (0:06:52.4) he’s not defending his oath.

SR: Well but he did finally stand up.

UM4: He finally, under pressure, came forth. Which was the right thing…

SR: However we gotta do it, to make them stand up in the end.

UM4: Sure (0:07:09.9)

SR: I talked to one of the sons, said they’re gonna release the cattle soon. DO you know how many head there are?

UM5: We don’t have an accurate count, we know they’ve been killing them and burying them out in the desert (0:07:29.2)

## Video pans around for a while. Shows a lot of folks standing around, a handful on horseback. A few have CSPOA shirts on.

## Video breaks at 0:08:29.1, cuts to applause. MB is on the phone, says something about “a lot of guns” (0:08:44.0). After a minute, video shows RM with a sidearm, talk about opening the gate. After another minute, a police vehicle drives up. An Unidentified Officer starts talking to the crowd via megaphone.

UO: I want everyone off the breaker and down along the banks. Stay wide, allow the cattle to come through. Go down there a ways, I don’t want the cows to be able to see you. (0:12:04.0)

## SR gives the camera to someone at 0:12:39.5. He walks back towards the fence with RM. Camera pans around a bit. Folks take the fence down to cheers around 0:13:23.6. SR helps. Woman holding the camera tells folks on horseback to be safe. Camera pans to a large group of individuals (men and women) on horseback. The police vehicle drives back a ways.

UM6: (0:16:46.5) Off in the distance you can see a line of BLM vehicles getting ready to leave. 

UM6: (0:19:00.1) This is called taking back what’s rightfully ours.

## SR takes camera back around (0:19:15.8)

SR: (0:19:23.0) Look at that, it’s awesome. That’s a posse.

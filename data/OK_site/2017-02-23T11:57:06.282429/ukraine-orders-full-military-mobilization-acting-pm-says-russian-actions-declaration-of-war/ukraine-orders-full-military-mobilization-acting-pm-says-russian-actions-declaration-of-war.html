<p><em>Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk said Sunday that his  country was “on the brink of disaster” and personally blamed Russian  President Vladimir Putin for bringing the two nations to the verge of  war. Speaking to reporters at the Ukrainian parliament, Mr. Yatsenyuk  called on the international community to rein in Mr. Putin and pressure  him to remove troops from the Crimean peninsula, where a majority of  residents are ethnic Russians but have Ukrainian passports.</em></p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p><em> “If President Putin wants to be the president who starts the war  between two friendly and neighboring countries, he has [almost] reached  this target,” Mr. Yatsenyuk said. “We are on the brink of disaster.  There was no reason for the Russian Federation to invade Ukraine.”</em></p>
<p><em>Western diplomats doubt that the Ukrainian armed forces would be able  to match up to the Russian forces already in control of the critical  infrastructure and border points in the Crimea.</em></p>
<p><em>Ukrainian leaders say that Russia has already sent an additional 6,000 troops to Crimea since tensions arose in the peninsula last week. The two countries have a military agreement that allows Moscow to base forces in the region, but Ukrainian officials accuse Moscow of violating that treaty by not informing Kiev of additional troops, and by moving forces without prior notice. Moscow says that it is in compliance of the accord.</em></p>
<p>Earlier Sunday, Ukraine’s interior minister said Russian officials had approached Ukrainian officers remaining in Crimea and offered them immediate Russian citizenship.</p>
<p><em>“Across the entire territory of Crimea, Russian emissaries and military officers have invited the remaining Ukrainian interior ministry troops to take Russian citizenship and immediately receive Russian passports,” Arsen Avakov wrote on his Facebook page. “This appeal has been aimed at upper and middle officer corps troops.”</em></p>
<p><em> Mr. Avakov denied that Ukrainian forces had threatened the Russian-speaking population on the largely pro-Russian peninsula, and blamed Russian forces for the sharp militarization of the region.</em></p>
<p>“In Crimea, there are no forces from the interior ministry or the regular army threatening citizens of the Russian Federation or the Russian-speaking population,” he said. “And also no self-defense units from Maidan have arrived from Kiev. All destabilization in the Crimea has come from and been masterminded in Russia.”</p>
<p>The BBC adds that it has seen what appear to be Russian troops digging  trenches on the Crimean border.  Furthermore, a standoff between  Ukrainian troops who have fortified a base in the crimean city of  Privolnoye, borth place of the late USSR president Mikhail Gorbachev,  and Russians who have surrounded them, may be the match that set it all  off. <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/world/2014/03/02/crimean-leader-claims-control-asks-russia-for-help-in-restoring-peace/" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.foxnews.com/world/2014/03/02/crimean-leader-claims-control-asks-russia-for-help-in-restoring-peace/', 'Fox reports ');" style="outline: 0px none; text-decoration: none;">Fox reports </a>that  hundreds of unidentified gunmen surrounded a Ukraine’s infantry base in  Privolnoye in its Crimea region Sunday. The convoy included at least 13  troop vehicles each containing 30 soldiers and four armored vehicles  with mounted machine guns. The vehicles — which have Russian license  plates — have surrounded the base and are blocking Ukrainian soldiers  from entering or leaving it.</p>

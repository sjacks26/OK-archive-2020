<p>by Jon Rappoport</p>
<p>In a minute, I’m going to print a stunning 1978 conversation between a US reporter and two members of the Trilateral Commission.</p>
<p>I discovered the conversation in the late 1980s, and ever since then,  I’ve been looking at it from various angles, finding new implications.   Here, I want to point out that the conversation was public knowledge at  the time.</p>
<p>Anyone who was anyone in Washington politics, in media, in think-tanks, had access to it.  Understood its meaning.</p>
<p>But no one shouted from the rooftops.  No one used the conversation to force a scandal.  No one protested loudly.</p>
<p>The conversation revealed that the entire basis of the Constitution  had been torpedoed, that the people who were running US national policy  were agents of an elite shadow group.  No question about it.</p>
<p>And yet: official silence.  Media silence.  The Dept. of Justice made  no moves, Congress undertook no serious inquiries, and the President,  Jimmy Carter, issued no statements.  Carter was himself a covert agent  in the White House, a willing pawn, and despite his proclaimed religious  values, was nothing more than a rank con artist, a hustler.</p>
<p>To boil down the 1978 conversation between the reporter and two Trilateral Commission members, and the follow-on response:</p>
<p>“The US has been taken over.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, so?”</p>
<p>By the way, the infamous Trilateral Commission still exists.</p>
<p>Many people think the TC, created in 1973 by David Rockefeller, is a relic of an older time.</p>
<p>Think again.</p>

Obama appointed <em>eleven</em> of them to posts in his administration.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p>* Tim Geithner, Treasury Secretary;<br/>
* James Jones, National Security Advisor;<br/>
* Paul Volker, Chairman, Economic Recovery Committee;<br/>
* Dennis Blair, Director of National Intelligence.</p>
<p>Several other noteworthy Trilateral members: George HW Bush; Bill Clinton; Dick Cheney; Al Gore.</p>
<p><strong>[Editor’s Note: It should be pointed out that Jimmy Carter was also a Trilateral Commission member.]</strong></p>
<p>Keep in mind that the original stated goal of the TC was to create “a new international economic order.”</p>
<p>In the run-up to his inauguration after the 2008 presidential  election, Obama was tutored by the co-founder of the Trilateral  Commission, Zbigniew Brzezinski.</p>
<p>Brzezinski wrote, four years before birthing the TC with his  godfather, David Rockefeller: “[The] nation state as a fundamental unit  of man’s organized life has ceased to be the principal creative force.  International banks and multinational corporations are acting and  planning in terms that are far in advance of the political concepts of  the nation state.”</p>
<p>Any doubt on the question of TC goals is answered by David Rockefeller himself, the founder of the TC, in his <span style="color:#000080;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Memoirs-David-Rockefeller/dp/0812969731" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.amazon.com/Memoirs-David-Rockefeller/dp/0812969731', 'Memoirs (2003)');" target="_blank"><em>Memoirs (2003)</em></a></span></span>:</p>
<p><em>“Some even believe we are part of a secret cabal working against  the best interests of the United States, characterizing my family and me  as ‘internationalists’ and of conspiring with others around the world  to build a more integrated global political and economic structure—one  world, if you will. If that is the charge, I stand guilty, and I am  proud of it.”</em></p>
<p>Okay.  Here is a close-up snap shot of a remarkable moment from out  of the past. It’s through-the-looking-glass—a conversation between  reporter, Jeremiah Novak, and two Trilateral Commission members, Karl  Kaiser and Richard Cooper. The interview took place in 1978. It  concerned the issue of who exactly, during President Carter’s  administration, was formulating US economic and political policy.</p>
<p>The careless and off-hand attitude of Trilateralists Kaiser and  Cooper is astonishing. It’s as if they’re saying, “What we’re revealing  is already out in the open, it’s too late to do anything about it, why  are you so worked up, we’ve already won…”</p>
<p>NOVAK (the reporter): Is it true that a private [Trilateral  committee] led by Henry Owen of the US and made up of [Trilateral]  representatives of the US, UK, West Germany, Japan, France and the EEC  is coordinating the economic and political policies of the Trilateral  countries [which would include the US]?</p>
<p>COOPER: Yes, they have met three times.</p>
<p>NOVAK: Yet, in your recent paper you state that this committee should  remain informal because to formalize ‘this function might well prove  offensive to some of the Trilateral and other countries which do not  take part.’ Who are you afraid of?</p>
<p>KAISER: Many countries in Europe would resent the dominant role that West Germany plays at these [Trilateral] meetings.</p>
<p>COOPER: Many people still live in a world of separate nations, and they would resent such coordination [of policy].</p>
<p>NOVAK: But this [Trilateral] committee is essential to your whole  policy. How can you keep it a secret or fail to try to get popular  support [for its decisions on how Trilateral member nations will conduct  their economic and political policies]?</p>
<p>COOPER: Well, I guess it’s the press’ job to publicize it.</p>
<p>NOVAK: Yes, but why doesn’t President Carter come out with it and  tell the American people that [US] economic and political power is being  coordinated by a [Trilateral] committee made up of Henry Owen and six  others? After all, if [US] policy is being made on a multinational  level, the people should know.</p>
<p>COOPER: President Carter and Secretary of State Vance have constantly alluded to this in their speeches.</p>
<p>KAISER: It just hasn’t become an issue.</p>

South End Press, Boston. Pages 192-3.</p>
<p>This interview slipped under the mainstream media radar, which is to say, it was ignored and buried.</p>
<p>US economic and political policy run by a committee of the Trilateral  Commission—the Commission had been been created in 1973 as an “informal  discussion group” by David Rockefeller and his sidekick, Zbigniew  Brzezinski.</p>
<p>When Carter won the presidential election, his aide, Hamilton Jordan,  said that if after the inauguration, Cy Vance and Brzezinski came on  board as secretary of state and national security adviser, “We’ve lost.  And I’ll quit.” Lost—because both men were powerful members of the  Trilateral Commission and their appointment to key positions would  signal a surrender of White House control to the Commission.</p>
<p>Vance and Brzezinski were appointed secretary of state and national  security adviser, as Jordan feared. But he didn’t quit. He became  Carter’s chief of staff.</p>
<p>Now consider the vast propaganda efforts of the past 40 years, on so  many levels, to install the idea that all nations and peoples of the  world are a single Collective.</p>
<p>From a very high level of political and economic power, this  propaganda op has had the objective of grooming the population for a  planet that is one coagulated mass, run and managed by one force. A  central engine of that force is the Trilateral Commission.</p>

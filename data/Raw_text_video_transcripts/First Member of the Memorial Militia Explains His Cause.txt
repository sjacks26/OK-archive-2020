## They’re at the WW2 memorial in DC. I think the context is the government shutdown where NPS shut down the monuments

CC: My name is Chris Cox, I’m the first member of the Memorial Militia. It’s day 16 of this militia incursion if you will. Our numbers have grown from 1, we have 717 members. Last weekend we had about 250-300 people to fortify this area as far as keeping it clean. We can’t hold our veterans in high esteem one minute and put that on hold the next. We’re out here to do the government’s job and to send a message to America that, don’t worry if they close these memorials. The citizens will step up and take care of them. We didn’t ask for the responsibility, but it falls on our shoulders as Americans (0:00:50.1). It’s getting back to the basics the way our fathers and our fathers’ fathers used to think about things. This is Robby Trup from northern VA.

CO: Robby, how did you find out about this?

RT: My mother is a good friend of his. My sister and her friend came last weekend to help. My mom offered to let me get out of school to come help him for the rest of the day. So I took that opportunity.

CO: What does it mean for you to be out here?

RT: I haven’t been doing a whole bunch of community work lately, I wanted to make it up.

CO: How old are you?

RT: 13, 8th grade.

CO: Do you feel it’s important for teenagers in America to get out and do community service?

RT: Yeah. If you look around during the government shutdown, there’s so much trash everywhere. We’re just trying to get that picked up.

CO: That’s honorable.

CC: Yeah it is. We want to encourage other Americans, you don’t have to go to a memorial or a park, just pitch in, do your part. Get back to the fundamentals of being an American (0:02:02.9). Make it happen.

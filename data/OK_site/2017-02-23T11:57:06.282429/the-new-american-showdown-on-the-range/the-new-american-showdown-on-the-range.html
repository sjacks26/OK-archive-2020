<p>–</p>
<p><strong>I attended a meeting</strong> in Virginia City, Montana, last night (May 22, 2014) to hear the President of the American Lands Council, Utah Representative Ken Ivory.</p>
<p>What I learned will take a little while to assimilate, but already I can say that the solution to any question relating to Cliven Bundy’s stand against the BLM in southern Nevada will be clarified nicely in coming times by information on the “<em>Federal vs States Lands Ownership</em>” which the American Lands Council shall be presenting in coming times.</p>
<p><strong>In the meantime I would like to introduce to our readers a really good catch-me-up article on the Bundy Ranch Front </strong>which is out in The New American Magazine.  We should really read this one at its home page, <a href="http://www.thenewamerican.com/usnews/item/18176-showdown-on-the-range" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.thenewamerican.com/usnews/item/18176-showdown-on-the-range', ' here');" target="_blank"> <em><strong>here</strong></em></a>,</p>

<p><strong>From that link a brief segment is offered below, to inspire readers to actually go and read this one. We think it’s important material for all Oath Keepers to know, because we’ll soon be uploading some gravity-laden material from the American Lands Council which will bring into play a new evaluation of the old conflict between Federal and State lands ownership and lands management. So do get your foundational intro first, now, with this article: (Quoting from The New American)<br/>
</strong></p>
<p><em>On April 15, Rep. Stockman [R, TX] sent a letter to President Barack Obama,  Department of the Interior Secretary Sally Jewell, and BLM Director Neil  Kornze, condemning the BLM “paramilitary raid.”</em></p>
<p><em>“Because of this standoff,” he wrote, “I have looked into BLM’s  authority to conduct such paramilitary raids against American citizens,  and it appears that BLM is acting in a lawless manner in Nevada….”</em></p>
<p><em>Stockman noted that in the matter of the Bundy conflict, “the  relevant local law enforcement officials appear to be the Sheriff of  Clark County, Nevada, Douglas C. Gillespie.”</em></p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p><em>“Indeed,” said Stockman, “the exact type of crisis that the federal  government has provoked at the Bundy ranch is the very type of incident  that Congress knew could be avoided by relying on local law enforcement  officials.”</em></p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p><em>“I call on the Administration to bring the BLM into compliance with  43 U.S.C. section 1733,” Stockman concluded. “Until this possible  violation of federal law can be more fully investigated, and the statute  requiring reliance on local law enforcement followed in both letter and  spirit, the federal government must not only stand down, but remove all  federal personnel from anywhere near the Bundy ranch.”</em></p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p><em>Washington State Representative Matt Shea, who was at the Bundy Ranch  during the tense standoff on April 12, told The New American he agrees  completely with Rep. Stockman. “A sniper rifle is not due process,” Rep.  Shea said, in a pithy comment that has been picked up and echoed by  many. Shea, who commanded infantry and cavalry units as a U.S. Army  officer during combat tours of Bosnia and Iraq, says the sight of  federal agents ready to shoot American citizens over “trespassing  cattle” and alleged back taxes was “absolutely appalling” to him. “That  is completely contrary to the way our legal system, our constitutional  system is supposed to operate, and seriously violates the oath taken by  each of us in uniform and public office,” the legislator/lawyer/military  veteran said.</em></p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p><em>Fox News’ senior judicial analyst Judge Andrew Napolitano explained,  in an interview with Dana Loesch of TheBlaze, that the federal  government had an alternative to “brute force” and the potential for  fatalities that come with it. He noted that Bundy has argued he wouldn’t  pay the federal grazing fee because the land on which he was grazing  his cattle belonged to the state, not the federal government.</em></p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p><em>“A federal court decided that it belonged to the federal government,  and that position was upheld on appeal,” Judge Napolitano said. “Now,  that is a decision that never should have been made by a  federal court, for two reasons. The federal government should never be  in a position in which it is deciding on the extent of its own power….  And secondly, when you have a dispute over real estate, there’s a  universal principle of law everywhere in the United States of America … that real estate disputes are resolved by state courts.”</em></p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p><em>Nevertheless, Napolitano noted, the federal government won and the  decision was upheld. “At that point the federal government could’ve  won,” Napolitano observed. “But instead of docketing the judgment,  instead of taking that piece of paper and filing it in the courthouse  and waiting for Mr. Bundy to pass the property on to someone else … it  decided to use brute force to enforce its judgment, and that’s when the  entire dynamic turned around.” The BLM, he said, which is “supposed to  be a bunch of bureaucrats” preserving land for the “future enjoyment of  all Americans” quickly became “a group of thugs dressed in military  uniform with loaded M16s pointed at a rancher and his family.”</em></p>

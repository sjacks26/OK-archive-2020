<p>by Charles Hugh Smith</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>One poorly understood source of collapse is the lack of pathways to contraction and a reduction of complexity/cost.</strong> The only pathway that is clearly marked is the one to expansion–of production, debt, credit, government, income, benefits, costs and complexity: more agencies, more regulations, more committees, more staff, more of everything.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The path to less complexity, less debt, less production and a contraction of the entire system doesn’t exist in most institutions.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Many dismiss any talk of collapse as mere fear-mongering.</strong> This is a legitimate issue to discuss, for if we focus exclusively on the lurid horrors of being killed by a shark in open water (for example) while ignoring the much higher risks of being killed by falling off a ladder at home, we have distorted the risks of accidental death and done a disservice to our understanding of various risks.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>But collapse is not an event, it is a process.</strong> As a result, systemic collapse doesn’t lend itself to statistical calculations of probability. Processes are driven by dynamics, not odds.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>So those dismissing any discussion of collapse <em>as mere fear-mongering</em> are doing a disservice to our understanding of processes–or lack thereof.</strong> One interesting feature of collapse is that it can result from either a choking over-abundance of complex, costly processes or a complete lack of <em>essential processes, conceptually and practically</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Which brings us to the process that is lacking virtually everywhere–the process of contraction:</strong> shrinking the system, income, headcount, complexity and being productive with less of everything.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>The corporate world offers many examples of what happens when the process of contraction and reducing complexity does not exist: companies buckle, fold and go bust.</strong> The world’s corporate darling Apple experienced this precise death-spiral in 1996-1997 before the company’s board brought Steve Jobs back as CEO. (So tentative was the board that Jobs was appointed “interim CEO.”)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Apple had only one path: expansion.</strong> More fiefdoms, more staff, more product lines, more models, more sales, more profits. The reversal from profits to losses marooned the company, for there was no institutional history of a vast reduction in products, fixed costs and organizational complexity.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Not only was there no institutional history of downsizing, there was no conceptual or practical pathway <em>from unprofitable bloat and institutional failure to a leaner, flatter more productive system</em>. Without an emergency infusion of cash from Microsoft and the appointment of a manager empowered to slash and burn fixed costs and re-set priorities and product lines, Apple would have collapsed.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>The same can be said of the European Union.</strong> The bylaws of the EU (as I understand them) define the pathway of <em>expanding the EU</em> but not the pathway of <em>forcibly shedding members</em>. Member nations may elect to leave the EU of their own volition, but there is no mechanism in place for the EU to eject member nations such as Greece.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>In other cases, systems are structured so any contraction leads to collapse.</strong> This is the nature of our debt/leverage-based financial system: any contraction in debt, credit or inflation will bring the system down because <em>the system is predicated on the permanent expansion of collateral to support more debt and the expansion of income to service debt.</em></p>

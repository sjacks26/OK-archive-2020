<content:encoded>Never underestimate the power of media to influence the masses. We, the People, must use our media access… primarily the Web for folks of our socioeconomic class… as effectively as possible.
<p>And adage that was more true when first created but still applies since established media owned and operated by corporations thus by an elite class are inherently more influential that the common folk’s voice upon the Web:</p>
<p>“Freedom of the press is a wonderful thing for those who can afford the presses”</p>
<p>Imagine the horrors confronting We, the People if we did not have the Web to present reality vice the lies and errors of omission that are a commonality of elite-owned media that is elite agenda driven.</p>

<content:encoded>The constitution says nothing about hiding our weapons as a condition for bearing them. That would be a lien on an inalienable right.

<content:encoded>Do any of you follow the blog of Adina Kutnicki?  In case you do not know, she is an old school intel analyst, an American who now lives in Israel.  Today she posted a piece concerning the media and how it has been brought under the control of our government and the globalist.  She specifically cites media coverage of Oath Keepers in Ferguson as a crystal clear example.  It is well worth your time to read her blog.

<content:encoded>Taking pics is their intimidation tactic.Every time I have been at a protest,the Muslims that show up to counter us,either take our pics,to intimidate,or hit our cameras.<br/>
And…this is not a “religious” rally,so why is “their religious protection” even an issue here?

<content:encoded>‘Left of Bang’; great book.  I believe I would be “cautiously ‘PC”‘ about interpreting a photo.  until I investigated, if possible.  In this case, you did and discovered that he was somewhat less than happy with the presence of Oath Keepers.  In a combat scenario, you wouldn’t shoot him but you surely wouldn’t turn your back on him either.  I don’t think that bandido776 was necessarily jumping to the conclusion that this was a bad guy.  I would also be cautious.  Why, because he was an obvious Muslim who approached the armed Oath Keepers in a tense environment that could turn violent at any moment.  If we should interpret something, take a look at the face of the tall Oath Keeper.  I think his face displays a little bit of what I’ve been talking about.  Based on my interpretation of the big guy’s face as he was looking directly at the Muslim man, I think that bandido776 was ‘right on’.  The picture, taken as a whole, may have led me also to post the word ‘WARNING’.  So the good doctor assessed the Muslim man not to be a threat in his first reply.  As it turned out, that assessment was incorrect and was referred to as a ‘clown’ by the good doctor.  That was not meant to be a condescending statement directed at you, Dr. Alford.  I hope that you don’t take it as such.  Reading the book is a good idea.  Making the right call in a potentially hostile environment is critical.  The Oath Keepers on the ground in Ferguson made the right call.  Outstanding!  That’s the view from my foxhole.

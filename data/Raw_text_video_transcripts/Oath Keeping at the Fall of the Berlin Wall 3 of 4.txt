GS: The next Monday was the anniversary of the republic, E Germany. 7th of November. That was a Monday. Everyone knew, we use this Monday. There will not be 75k, there will be much more. It was 150k. Out of population of 16m, and the city was just .5m. It was huge. During this week, on Tuesday, they brought paratroops. They realized that when they tried to use the army, it probably wouldn’t work. The officers at the HQ in the army were living in the city.
 SR: They were from there.

GS: From Leipzig. In our base, in and around Leipzig. It wasn’t professional soldiers. They had to serve in the army for 18 months. They were happy to leave. They would never do anything in the city. They knew the situation, because it had been going on for 10 months.
 SR: So they couldn’t rely on the troops from that area.

GS: Absolutely. 

SR: Who’d they bring in?

GS: Not the officers, and not the troops. So they brought it paratroops. We had 2 armies, one in the north and one in the south. The south was Leipzig. They brought young guys, 18-22, from the north. They trained in streetfighting.

SR: Urban warfare.

GS: The guys had no idea. They told them, these people will destroy our republic, they come from the west, all this stuff.

SR: They’re terrorists.

GS: Haha. Right-wing extremists. It’s the same. There was the question, will you descend to the street or not. They stayed in the base. Our army commander, the lt. general said I am in command here. You can go back or stay in the base. You can only leave the base to go back.

SR: That’s what he told them?

GS: That was before. The party was in charge of the army. Same as here, the commander-in-chief. On Monday, about 10am, the rally started at 9pm. The streets were, by 5pm full. At 10 in the morning, all officers in the army HQ had a meeting. About 1 block away was the HQ of the Russian army. (0:03:49.9) The martial was the commander for all the troops in Poland and the Czech. He was there. Normally he was never there. He spoke perfect German, he was at least 65. Actually a good guy. He was sitting there next to our general. The general said okay, we have the order to use everything we have to stop the rallies for ever.

SR: How many people were in the streets that day?

GS: Later, 150k. 1% of the whole population of E Germany.

SR: So the Russian commander said we must use everything to stop it.

GS: No, the party said that. The Russian commander didn’t say anything, just watched what was going on. He was like a grandfather. Our commander told us okay, we have the order. You took the oath of our constitution to defend our people. This is all we have to do and nothing else.

SR: That’s what he told the party?

GS: He told this to us. He said we will not obey this order. No soldier of our army will leave the base today. Not even the paratroopers from the other army.

SR: So they were told they were ordered to leave the base to stop the protest, but the commander of the base said no one will leave the base.

GS: No one will leave the base. (0:05:41.9) He said, this order, no one leave the base, will be obeyed. If someone thinks different, he can leave the army. He meant the officers. When I saw this, about 20% of the officers said this was the right decision, 20% would think he should follow the party, and the rest were quiet.

SR: Now the 20% that said they should follow the party, what did they do?

GS: Nothing. There was no way. The commander, the Lt. general said no one will leave the base.

SR: What did the enlisted men? Where were they? How did they break out?

GS: (0:06:39.3) It’s hard to say. There were 520 officers. I knew all of them in person. I was there a long time. 20% I’m pretty sure would never obey an order. The Lt. general knew this too. He also knew some guys were strong for the party, but will be quiet when they get an order. And the others would also do what he said. The only reason for this meeting was to make clear he would give this command and that everyone had to follow it. A funny thing, not funny it was good, after this it was clear we would obey this order of our commander, who said everyone stays in the base.

SR: He was saying, you stay in the base because to go out there and stop the protestors is unconstitutional.

GS: He said exactly that.

SR: They had given you a written constitution that sounded good. Now he said well okay, we’re going to obey the constitution. Is that how it happened?

GS: Exactly this. (0:08:06.8) He said clearly this order, we will not obey because it’s against the constitution, against our oath, against our people.

SR: What was the oath like in E Germany?

GS: The oath was just to the constitution, to defend the constitution and our people. Pretty short. The constitution was clear in this point. 

SR: Why did they have an oath like that? You would think that a totalitarian state would say oh you must obey us. But because they were trying to separate from the past of Nazi Germany, right?

GS: Probably I guess. The party was sure in the beginning. They can take any oath they want, we tell them what they have to do. It works in the beginning. They sent them to Czechoslovakia. In the beginning, when the army was created, the party was absolutely sure, because they selected the officers from the party, that the army would always follow our command.

SR: The party put the officers in place

GS: Yes

SR: They were the puppets of the party

GS: The party was absolutely sure they will always follow the party. In the beginning, they were right. Even in 68, just a few officers said no. The rest went.

SR: And the ones who said no were disappeared, no one saw them again.

GS: Yes.

SR: So for the world perception, they could say oh we are democratic. We have a constitution.

GS: Looks good.

SR: Looks good to the rest of the world, for propaganda. But they felt safe to do that because they had control

GS: Yes. But they lost control over the whole E Germany. All the people. People even went on the street. That could never happen before. It changed completely, not just in E Germany. In Russia, Poland.

SR: Romania too

GS: Yes. In Poland, it started in the mid-80s.

SR: Solidarity Movement, yeah

GS: They could do nothing in Poland. Poland was after the Czech. They could not expect the E German army to support them. The Russian army would be alone in Poland. Poland and Russia were never great friends, never in history. They could not try this. It was too late.

SR: They had already lost legitimacy. So the people stood up and the army stood down and refused to stop the people. What happened next?

GS: (0:10:55.2) The people on the street. The security, Stasi, there were there but far away and didn’t try anything.

SR: Why?

GS: It was not clear. No one expected the army to stand down. I didn’t know at the time, the Russian. When we finished our meeting, the marshall from the Russian army said this is your job. No soldier from my army will leave the base. Do it on your own.

SR: Really. Why do you think he did that?

GS: Probably an order, maybe from Gorbachev. They could never do anything without orders. In this category. Probably the Russians said don’t do anything in E Germany. Let them do what they want. We stay out of it.

SR: They were already weakened, also.

GS: Gorbachev said this to our party secretary, shortly before he said. What exactly. Who comes too late, he will be punished by the live. He means when you are not going the way we are going, your life will be punished. He said this in Russian. Most of the E German understood Russian.

SR: I’m not sure clear what you mean.

GS: He means when you not see the sign and go the right way

SR: The way things are going

GS: Then you will be punished by your life, your people, anyone. He told him you have to go this way. In E Germany the party would not go. Then the head of the rally, everyone knows it’s gone. No party security on the street, no army on the street. Nothing happened. It was huge. 150k out of 16m. It’s not easy.

SR: And each one in the street is only a small fraction of all the others who feel the same way.

GS: And it wasn’t organized. No one organized this. It started with 80-100 people. They left a church and went down the street. The rest came on their own. There was no organization like the Tea Party. It was not possible, they would have been arrested right away. Everyone was there by their own decision. You can imagine how many people were too far away to make it, or were there and stayed home thinking hopefully it works. Much much more.

SR: They felt the same way. The tip of the iceberg.

GS: It was actually over. But the wall was still there. Shortly after, they were considering in the party what they should do. There was no power anymore. A colonel from the other army said you have to build a group

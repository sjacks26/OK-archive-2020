## Alex Jones; Stewart Rhodes

Alex Jones: [00:00:00] You know I apologize to Stewart Rhodes but I bet he got a big response the last time he was on from Oath Keepers. They're having a big move to get even more people out to take the oath against firing on U.S. citizens, confiscating guns, doing things like that. But side issue Stewart. What do you think of them openly announcing they're terraforming the planet. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:00:23] I just came on. I just caught the tail end of your of your discussion about that. It's pretty amazing. So I'll have to defer until I listen to the rest of what you said. 

Alex Jones: [00:00:33] While we're going to come back to you and give me some time to talk and I want to be back up for a full hour in the near future. How did this happen. In a nutshell tell us about Oath Keepers. Very exciting. So the police or military uphold their oath. And don't go to war with the people. Which will also be very healthy for them. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:00:49] Absolutely. This is our mission is to talk to our time is to make sure that you know the men with the big guns are on our side. And the response has been amazing. Well I want listeners to know about us as we are rallying on the Lexington Green on April the 19th, which is the anniversary of the first shot in the American Revolution the shot heard round the world. And we're going to be there on the same exact spot that first took place. And we're going to read out our declaration of war orders we will not obey. Read them aloud and reaffirm our oath to defend the Constitution against all enemies foreign and domestic. And we're talking. We've got active duty military flying in from all over the country. Active duty police officer. 

Alex Jones: [00:01:32] What day is that. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:01:33] April 19th. 

Alex Jones: [00:01:36] 1770 1775. Baby that's where it all started. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:01:40] That's right April 19 1775 was when the martial law under General Gage sent out his regulars to go confiscate the cannon and the powder in Concord, and on the way into Lexington. Captain Parker and the Lexington, the Massachusetts militia mustered on the green in the face of the British. That's where the first shots fired in the American Revolution. That's where it all began. And so we're going to be standing there and that's what we're going have our first public meeting as Oath Keepers is going to be great there. 

Alex Jones: [00:02:08] I just had a vision I just had a vision. I've got to stop shooting by the end of April for my new Obama film. I'm going to send a camera crew and show this event at the end of the film about this being the solution. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:02:20] Absolutely. You need to be there Alex. You're going to regret not being there for nothing. 

Alex Jones: [00:02:25] No but I mean literally sir and enemy forces are killing me. I'm here in the command bash to say you're in the headquarters. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:02:32] OK well I will definitely do that. 

Alex Jones: [00:02:34] You know what I mean I'd love to fly up there it's just literally here's the issue I can do 20 radio interviews a day on people shows. I mean I'm reaching millions a day on my own shows. The problem is believe me I'd rather travel around and be part of this but I can't be in all places at one time. I'm going to go to sit here at Midas Tirith. Like we said last time and I'm looking off at the guy eye across the mountain range. 

Alex Jones: [00:02:58] This is very very historical going on there. So tell folks the date the time. I may come, I will at least dispatch Jason Bermas. It's his turn to be fired out as the InfoWar probe droid, I've been sending the whole crews out for shoots lately so I can stay here. Used to have to spread myself thin here. Tell us about the event tell us what's coming up tell us about your Again the 10 principals here on air with us, with the Oath Keepers. by the way did you get a big response last time you were on. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:03:27] Oh absolutely. You bet we did. Thank you very much. 

Alex Jones: [00:03:30] Did you hear From a lot more military and police? I know you've already heard from thousands. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:03:34] We've got a flood of active duty military men that are signing up and are coming to Lexington. We're getting new and you know we've got reams Marines of Camp Pendleton. We've got officers, oh six and above come in from the Navy and from from all the services. So it's been pretty amazing. So what we're going to do is April 19th on Lexington Green in Lexington, Massachusetts, right there where the first shots were fired in the American Revolution, on the anniversary. We're going to we're going to rally we're going to muster. It's an event put on by committees of safety which was founded by Walter Ready and Edwin Vieira. And Mr. Vieira is going to speak. Mr. Ready's going to speak about their mission, the committees of safety and they invited us. They were kind enough to invite me to speak but I decided to turn around around to invite all the Oath Keepers to come in and do a muster. And we're going to reaffirm our oaths right there on the green, we're gonna have active duty military and police and veterans. And for those folks who have never sworn an oath to defend the Constitution but want to do so they're welcome to join us on the on the green right there. What better place to do it. It's sacred ground. On the anniversary of the sacred day for Americans. what better place to throw down the gauntlet and let them, those powers that be, know that it's not going down the way they think it's going. 

Alex Jones: [00:04:52] Absolutely and again Edwin Vieira when we are a constitutional lawyer, constitutional scholar, routine guest here with us an amazing individual. the other gentlemen I'm aware of his work great work as well. And I know the listeners have been trying to you know really energize their committees of safety. that's what began as you know for listeners who may not, in the decade before 1775 and the Sons of Liberty, as and the tyranny got worse and worse they began to organize and petition and put out the information and say look you're committing crimes, you're abusing ,is you better stop. Better stop. Better stop. And the Crown said how dare you resist this. How dare you criticize this. You know how dare you call for resisting us. That's treason. Same stuff we're hearing now. And I want to call out. Dr. Edwin Vieira and others as just great founding Patriots. When Clinton was trying gun confiscations and announcing on MTV they were going to ban the guns and all of this, Edwin Vieira and others stood up and said we need to remember the militia. Every able bodied man, the second amendment is enshrined, that all men live in Switzerland and other countries are there to defend and it's our sacred right in our duty to own firearms. And they called forth the real citizens militia to defend against tyranny. 

Alex Jones: [00:06:03] That's why the feds then created the false militia, infiltrated it, when people said hey let's hide behind the shed, Let's dress in cammo, let's build pipe bombs. It was always federally led, creating a fake Viper militia out of a motorcycle team. They created the fake militia. So the media couldn't demonize it and attack it. The ADL, the Southern Poverty Law Center got caught running these groups, mainstream news has reported on that, Elohim City. So you know that's the groups we're talking. about the real militia versus the counterfeit militia. like we're the real patriot movement. and you've got Glenn Beck who's definitely an operative there, who tried to get your confidence and then stabs you in the back as we predicted. So so I just want to point out that this is people in the military and the police saying we'll just keep our oath. This is the key to not having a confrontation between the military and police and the people because if they're told to carry in an unconstitutional orders they won't and then that won't bring in the ensuing hysteria and warfare that the establishment wants. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:07:05] That's right. And and one thing I would also mention is that Sheriff Richard Mack is going to be there. I've invited him to come speak. And we've tried to a message to Jack McLamb but definitely Sheriff Mack is going to be there. He has a new book out on the power of the sheriff and responsibility of the sheriff to be a barrier between the federal government and the people. 

Alex Jones: [00:07:25] Bermas had him on Monday night. And certainly what the audience is aware of that book he's got out and that's certainly true. Kicking the feds out and getting local control again. How many people have contacted you over on the side. I know it's got a lot of traffic. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:07:40] Oh several hundred thousand hits and just floods and floods of e-mails, thousands of e-mails. And like I said we've we've got quite a response of people that are heading to Lexington and it's pretty short notice, we know, but it's pretty amazing how fast the response has been. And also I've been invited to speak at a Tea Party rally in Knoxville, Tennessee, on the 15th. I might fly out there and just kind of do it impromptu guest speech for them. And so what they want to do they want it they want. They want to make it so that every protest from now on has an oath ceremony, that that man who would have taken the oath in the past veterans or courts or military or law enforcement can step up and we affirm the oath and and those who never have taken an oath to defend the Constitution can do so. And that would be pretty amazing to have a thousand people standing there with her hands raised and vowing to defend the Constitution. I think it's a really great idea. 

Alex Jones: [00:08:32] Absolutely. this is completely beautiful what's happening instead of the ADL, the Southern Poverty Law Center saying Patriots and constitutionalists want to kill you. They're dangerous. The Founding Fathers are bad. We've got to confiscate the guns. We're saying, no stand with the people, the bill of rights, the Constitution. because if you let the bankers who are openly taking the country over use you against the people like the IMF and World Bank do in third world countries whose public plan this is going to get really nasty. We're trying to short circuit the corporate controlled system trying to cause riots. I'm sure you've noticed that they're all over the media trying to hide rioting and civil insurrection. So they can then blame it on us. This is essential to stop this clash from happening. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:09:17] That's right. Absolutely. If the military and the police realize their true duty to the people and their oath to the Constitution then it just can't happen. It's came game over, it's checkmate for them so they can't they cannot do it without the military and the police and that's our mission. 

Alex Jones: [00:09:34] That's right the globalists have to have enforcers, there's only a few thousand of them. And that's why they love the tragic murder of those three police officers by a white supremacist and it turns out the white supremacist was attacking me on Web sites. But the Southern Poverty Law Center didn't care. They went and found those comments and tried to claim you know tie it to the patriot movement, Ron Paul, myself and everybody else and now they've had to retract. But but again that shows they're scared of us that they're resorting to tactics like that because they don't want the police and military Joining us.

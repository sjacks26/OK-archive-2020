## 911 call about Jose being shot. Screen shows the front of a garage with an American flag and signs reading “Police Abuse Victim,” “Jose Manuel Guerena 11-23-84 5-5-11,” “War Hero.” Pans to pics of him in uniform, with his unit and alone. “Simple Man” is playing in the background.

RT: (0:01:05.7) Let’s start in Arizona, where a SWAT raid went wrong and left a 2 tour former Marine dead. SWAT teams had targeted a series of houses in an ongoing drug investigation. When they got to the house of Jose Guerena, he had already been alerted by his wife that someone was outside. He grabbed his rifle. Before he could remove the safety, he was greeted by more than 60 bullets from law enforcement. Turns out that as the wife was trying to help her dying husband, the SWAT team refused to let anyone attend to Guerena, leaving no hope for him to survive. After requests from the local press, the wife’s 911 call was released to the public.

RT: After the raid and after shooting Guerena 60 times, the cops didn’t find any evidence of drugs.

## Editorial: why does that matter? Would it have been okay to shoot him if they had found evidence of drugs? LEOs are supposed to use force to protect their lives and the lives of others, not to kill people who have committed crimes. Their use of force should have been based on an evaluation of the situation and the threat posed by the individual they faced, not the likelihood or reasonableness of an assumption that a crime was committed. This is not to say that the use of force was appropriate, just that whether Guerena was a criminal shouldn’t have any bearing on whether it was appropriate. If he drew a weapon in a way that was deemed threatening by the responding officers, then the only room for complaint (it seems to me) is that the responding officers interpreted the level of threat incorrectly. Rhodes’s complaint is much more reasonable than the implicit one by RT.

SR: (0:03:32.8) What happened to this young Marine shouldn’t happen to any American. Armed or not, no American, no free person should ever have to worry about agents of the state kicking in their door, dynamic entry, for a mere search warrant on a person with no criminal history of violent crime. The problem with this situation, why we’re going to Tucson, Arizona, is to point out that this is a particularly tragic and egregious example of what’s wrong with using SWAT in this way. That’s the problem, that’s why this policy needs to be changed. That’s why we’re going there, to highlight the problem with this policy. Search warrant should not be a death warrant. A policy of sending SWAT in to do search warrants like this will lead to more deaths. This Memorial Day, we’re going to rally in Tucson, we’re going to march to the home, (0:04:30.9) we’re going to hold a ceremony. The purpose of being there is to honor all of our war dead by defending the Constitution that they swore an oath to defend, that they gave their life to defend. There’s no better way to honor them than to defend it now. We’ve got to make sure this policy stops across the country. We need to put political pressure, legal pressure on your sheriff and state legislature, make sure there are safeguards and ways of limiting this practice, so more Americans aren’t killed.

RM: (0:05:08.0) We need to show support to this family. I think we need to honor him as a Marine, that he risked his life for our country, regardless of our opinion of these wars. Law enforcement has to be noble and honest enough to look at itself and admit openly, we’ve been part of the problem just like the judiciary and the legislative branches. The corruption going on in our country and the destruction of America and our Constitution, we in law enforcement own part of that and we’ve got to clean our own house. That’s why I’m ready to go down to Tucson, I feel very dedicated to this. We need to show these people, this family, that there are cops who believe this was wrong. That’s what I want to do. Not in two years, not in two months, not in two weeks. Standing with this family is right. Our speeches have to be tactful and to the point, but also very patriotic, and memorialize this man who was killed and support this family. I know Sheriff Clarence Dupnick, and I know he’s wrong, and he’s been wrong about a lot of things. When cops are wrong, I’ll say so. When they’re right, I’ll say that too. This was wrong.

<content:encoded>The photo of the two officers pointing weapons at the cat, was I am sure in fun.  If you look at the vehicles in the back ground, they are parked most likely at a training site.  As a retired detective I can tell you that humor is a necessary stress reliever.  As a cop for 30 years, I can tell you that most line level officers are very mindful of and dedicated to the constitution.  Administrators on the other hand are beholden to local politicians.  Dislike, distrust and ridicule of law enforcement generally comes from law breakers, not honest citizens.  Who do think is going come when you call 911 in an emergency?

<content:encoded>Thank you for posting. Here is the link to the article at Truthout:
<p><a href="http://www.truth-out.org/news/item/34367-exclusive-navy-uses-us-citizens-as-pawns-in-domestic-war-games" rel="nofollow">http://www.truth-out.org/news/item/34367-exclusive-navy-uses-us-citizens-as-pawns-in-domestic-war-games</a></p>
<p>Regarding the fact that Truthout is a “Left Gate Keeper” or sorts, or is seen to be by some readers, I have seen other good articles there in past years. Oath Keepers is neither “Left” nor “Right”. The truth does out, and no one has a monopoly on truth. </p>
<p>Salute!<br/>

<content:encoded>Later this year SEALs will be conducting “realistic military training” in or near urban areas in western Washington. This was revealed via leaked Navy documents provided to Truthout as detailed in “EXCLUSIVE: Navy Uses US Citizens as Pawns in Domestic War Games” by Dahr Jamail. You don’t have to like or agree with the politics of the folks at Truthout to be concerned with such exercises.

<content:encoded>Well, I would say that much of that military hardware and equipment will be taken with the honorable ones that come over to the side of liberty just like much of the equipment and munitions that the military has will be changing hands with the Oath Keeping military that fall in on the side of liberty.  The rest of the ammunition, weapons and equipment will be kept safe and sound for later drawing as the need and opportunity arises.  Then again most of the bullies and scoundrels that will stay with the usurpers will provide much of their kits and weapons when they either drop it to run or it is found on their stinking caucuses. These enemies within are sorely underestimating their oppositions will, training, experience and determination, don’t you think.

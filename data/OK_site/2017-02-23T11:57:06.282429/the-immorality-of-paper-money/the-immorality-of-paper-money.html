<p>The rise of the Stock Market in recent years has nothing to do with economic health. It is reminiscent of the Dutch Tulip mania, that depended on the continued belief that the price of tulip bulbs would continue to rise, though the value of the actual bulbs had long since been eclipsed. It is similar to a Ponzi scheme. – Shorty Dawkins</p>

<p>by Bob Livingston</p>
<p>One of today’s most common economic fallacies is that the soaring  stock market is evidence of economic recovery. Nothing could be further  from the truth.</p>
<p>Stocks have almost tripled since the 2008 collapse, but that stock  growth stems from Federal Reserve money printing (inflation) and near  zero interest rates. The Fed’s balance sheet has grown more than  fourfold since 2008 — to $4.3 trillion — and was used to prop up the  “too big to fails.” That money had to go somewhere.</p>
<p>It has found its way into the stock market because U.S. Treasuries  are paying less than the rate of inflation; and corporate bonds,  certificates of deposit and other fixed-income products pay even less.  This and price inflation (currency devaluation) is fueling the rise, not  positive economic growth or common sense.</p>
<p>Stocks are being bought by the banksters and large corporations. Average people aren’t buying them. A <a href="http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2013/05/31/stocks-and-the-recovery-majority-of-americans-not-invested-in-the-market/" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2013/05/31/stocks-and-the-recovery-majority-of-americans-not-invested-in-the-market/', 'study by the Pew Research Center');" target="_blank">study by the Pew Research Center</a> found fewer than half of all Americans (45 percent) own stocks. The  number is down from 65 percent in 2002. Individual investors are cashing  in their retirement funds just to survive.</p>
<p>Government printing press money distorts economic reality, dilutes  morality and is the true source of “income inequality.” Financial  speculation rises with the increase in paper money and the general work  ethic deteriorates. The something-for-nothing mentality pervades  society.</p>
<p>Paper money promotes the “quick buck” syndrome like narcotics  peddling and hookers on the streets. Hookers, incidentally, were  widespread in the Weimar Republic in Germany in 1923 because the women  had to sell their bodies for food for themselves and their families.</p>
<p>In a paper money society, the social order visibly deteriorates. The  morality of the stable gold standard gradually changes to the amorality  of fiat. Few people see the cause and effect, and the politicians try to  legislate human behavior. They always fail, as the system is overrun  with jails and prisons.</p>
<p>Fiat promotes an illusory reality where non-substance like financial  speculation and gambling replaces the substance of industrial production  and long-term value. When consumption surpasses income, as the  government and the politicians promote, distorted human emotions replace  stable behavior. Social breakdown increases, and real values are  forgotten.</p>
<p>Prices of labor and craftsmen escalate beyond all reason when there  is never enough money. Service repairmen charge fees like medical  doctors.</p>
<p>When labor and supplies are valued in fiat, everything becomes  distorted. In the final stages of hyperinflation, there is no anchor to  sanity and common sense.</p>
<p>Paper money expands consumption way beyond income. This eventually  guarantees debt collapse and social breakdown. The foundation of the  household collapses and the middle class is destroyed. Paper money is an  illusion because it is non-substance and can be created by the  government to infinity. When the people accept numbers on green strips  of paper or computer symbols for money, they accept illusion for  reality. They accept non-substance for substance. Real money (gold and  silver) comes from the earth and human production. It is no illusion.</p>

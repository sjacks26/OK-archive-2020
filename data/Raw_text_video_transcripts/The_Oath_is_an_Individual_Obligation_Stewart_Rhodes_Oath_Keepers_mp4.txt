Stewart Rhodes: [00:00:04] It's been a long standing legal obligation to disobey unlawful orders. Not just an option, a duty. you can be in the hot seat certainly can. Michael New is in the hot seat. He was in the hot seat refusing to serve under U.N. command and wear a UN beret. because not because he is some kind of right wing extremist but because he looked at the Constitution and said hey who the heck are those officers. They're not commissioned by Congress. They haven't gone through the process. Appointed by the president commissioned by Congress. They're not, I'm not lawfully bound to, In fact I'm bound to disobey and not surrender their command. They are not my lawful commanders. That's when he stood on. And did he win his case? No he didn't. Does that mean he was wrong. He had to make a decision. That's the whole point. On the spot. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:00:59] The men in Vietnam who were there at the My Lai massacre had an individual responsibility to make a decision about whether or not to apply those orders. After it was over, Lieutenant Calley defended himself by saying I was just following the orders of my superior officer. Was that a valid defense? It was not. He was convicted of war crimes. The warrant in officer - sadly I forget his name if you know it tell me - the warrant officer who stepped in and stopped the My Lai massacre. He was in charge of the blue two choppers came in basically threatened to turn his M-60s on the guys if they didn't stop it. They were killing little little kids. No one you could even by any stretch of imagination construe as an enemy combatant. They were shooting them. He threatened to machine gun them. He stopped it. So there you have it. Oath breaker Lieutenant Calley who abdicated his own responsibility to to to fulfill his oath make his own decisions, just followed orders, and you had an Oath Keeper someone who stopped it. Good example. As the Nazis learned at Nuremberg just following orders is no defense. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:02:15] And you don't get it. You don't have a hotline to the Supreme Court or this or this or the military court of appeals. U.S. Army Courts of Appeals, or any of those courts of appeals. You don't have a hotline for them to stand in and rice paddy are out in the deserts of Iraq or in downtown middle America in Mayberry. You got to make a decision. All you military are here all you that are out there. you have an individual obligation to make a decision on the spot. It might not be fun. It might not be sunshine flowers and fluffy clouds for you. It could be really bad. if you are found to have disobeyed a lawful order in wartime you can be put to death. Let's not sugarcoat it. But I'll tell you what if you are found to have obeyed an unlawful order. You're also you're also in the sling aren't you. You can be charged tried convicted and also put to death. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:03:08] So what's that mean. Recall I said a little while ago. We're all going to die. You do what you swore to. Do you obey the law. You support and defend the Constitution. You do so. You've refuse to obey unlawful orders. Now in Germany the oath was to the fuhrer, Was to a man. If you've seen the movie Valkerie, if you haven't see that movie I recommended it. The reason why these the plotters against the plotters against Hitler who saw them was destroying Germany he was wrecking Germany and then additionally he's doing the rest of Europe but he was destroying their own country that they saw themselves as the defender of Germany defenders of Germany. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:03:51] But they had sworn an oath to Hitler to obey him unconditionally and to die for him. And so in order to save their country they had to violate their oath. They put in a horrible position of violating an oath they swore to God. That's right the Nazi oath included the word to God. They bastardized that too. They swore the oath to Hitler, a sacred oath to support, in order to obey Hitler and so to to save their country that did violate their own oath. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:04:23] Thankfully we are in a better position. the founders with their wisdom understood the problem, the unworthiness, the illegitimacy of swearing an oath to a person. That's why our oath is to the Constitution. in this country we save our country by keeping our oath. In fact it's the only way we will save this country from following the footsteps of all the other countries that have gone down a long sad slide into despotism, Into tyranny. We save it by keeping our oath. if all we do, like Chauncey's said in one interview on Lexington Green. If all we can do is keep our oaths we can take care of everything right there. We can restore the full protections of the Bill of Rights. We can restore the rule of law. We can restore peace, tranquility, and the blessings of liberty if all we do is keep our oaths. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:05:24] And that's our message it's all we talk about is very simple. Please just keep your oath. I like that one reporter yesterday I was like well what are these 10 orders you won't obey. This is another oath and they keep you know keep hammering on that. It's not. The only oath. How dare how. How would I ever dare to to encourage anyone to take any other oath to anything other than to the Constitution. What would I be if I were to do that. I'd be an oath breaker too. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:05:51] No, the oath to the Constitution, that's all we ever talk about. The whole point of the ten orders is simply to say look these are the examples of what we believe in our with goodwill and in our best discernment are examples of violations of your oath that are most dangerous to this republic. These are the things that if you do would be most likely to lead to either despotism or to a desperate revolution or even a civil war. Something we never want to see again. 

Chauncey: [00:06:24] If we all do nothing more than fulfill our oath then we can turn things around. Just on that alone

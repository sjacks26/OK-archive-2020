## Jason Van Tatenhove; Jordan Page

JVT: JVT with OK here with Jordan Page. We’re at the Page household having our family Thanksgiving. We’re extending our wishes to you and your family on the holiday. Jordan, you have a new song coming out.

JP: Today! It’s the worldwide release of Arm Yourselves, Act III. It’s a powerful 2A anthem, that OK, an organization I’m very involved with and so is Jason. It’s a song that speaks to the mission of OK and the mission of the song is to educate the public what’s really going on in the country and in the world. And it’s time that we arm ourselves spiritually and with force of arms, as well as with the truth. With those 3 things, we will be successful (0:00:58.5) in fighting the enemies that we face. It drops today, anywhere that you download music, you can get it. 

JVT: This song is incredible. I’ve been talking to Jordan through the whole production process. It’s really coming together. It’s going to be an anthem for us in the Liberty Movement. It’s $.99, it goes to support JP and his family, just the cause of liberty. It’s going to support OK too. It’s $2 for both songs. That’s nothing. Take the time, you’re sitting there with your families, you’ve just eaten all that turkey, you got some downtime during the holidays, take the time to play it for your family.

JP: Shoutout to sponsors that contributed to the campaign. First, OK and OK membership. Come and Take It Armor. Tactical Supply out of Yakima, Washington. High end rifle company and Roberts & Roberts precious metals brokerage in Pensacola, FL. They’ve come aboard as financial sponsors to help produce the music video, in participation with OK and starring some members of OK. It’s going to be a hard hitting (0:02:30.8) short film with both songs put together. Big thanks to my buddy Stewart Rhodes for helping me. I think it’s time to sing.

JVT: We’re gonna have our family come down.

JP: We’ve got the Von Pages here. Everybody sing.

## 7 kids singing with JP.

JP: Arms yourselves for the hammer’s crashing down. Arm yourselves all ye citizens. Arm yourselves with the ghost of a risen son. And lay your armor on. There’s no time left, the day has come.

JP: Happy Thanksgiving from all of us here in the Great American Redoubt.

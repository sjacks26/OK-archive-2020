<p><strong>Steven Cornelius:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Testimonial: I entered the Army in 1974 and swore to defend my country from all enemies, foreign and domestic. I take that order seriously to this day. My pledge did not end when my enlistment ended! I come from a long line of Patriots that started with the Revolutionary War, Indian Wars, Civil War, WWI, WWII, Korean War, 1st Gulf War with my sister, a nurse and coming soon to a town near you, WWIII if our President is not careful..</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If there be war, let it be in my time, so that my Grandchildren do not have to fight in it! Let it be quick and let it not be too painful to my Republic.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Gary Krause:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Testimonial: My grandfathers served, my father served, his brothers served, my brother served, I served 1970 – 1976. My mothers grand-parents were murdered by Hitler henchmen in a German concentration camp, the same regime that disarmed it’s citizens. Our United States of America constitution is our signature document to stand against such tyranny. My oath to support and defend that Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same; that I take this obligation freely, without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion; and that I will well and faithfully discharge the duties of the office on which I enter is born in my blood. So help me God. The God of our fathers fathers!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“The strongest reason for the people to retain the right to keep and bear arms is, as a last resort, to protect themselves against tyranny in government.” Thomas Jefferson.  Just ask the 130,000,000 murdered in the 20th century who gave up such a right in a disguise of absolute dominion. Need I name our modern perpetrators?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We the people are under attack, we the people have been declared the enemy on numerous levels of patriotism. I join Oath Keepers as a testament that I stand by my oath that our forefathers fought, bled, and died to protect freedom, liberty and justice for all.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="../wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Sons-of-Liberty-2-e1424637561760.jpeg"><img alt="Sons of Liberty 2" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5274" height="150" src="../wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Sons-of-Liberty-2-e1424637561760.jpeg" width="225"/></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Jim:</strong></p>
<p>Testimonial: Greetings my brothers and sisters…</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Just recently joined Oath Keepers even though I have known about the organization for a while. I am a military retiree who served this great nation faithfully and honorably for over 22 years.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I did 4 years in the Marine Corps and attained the rank of Sergeant. After a seven year break in service, I joined the Navy as a Hospital Corpsman. I did 18+ years in the Navy and retired as a Chief Independent Duty Hospital Corpsman.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Unfortunately, growing up I had little interest in politics and didn’t really follow the agendas of the parties or those in office. It has only been less than 10 years since my awakening to the harsh realities and wrong doings of our government.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It is quite clear, at least in my eyes, that the current administration does not have the interest of the people who put them in office in mind. The Constitution has been shoved aside and abandoned as those in office try to force their own agendas without abiding by the Law of the Land. This my friends is Tyranny.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">From my very first day in the military, as all of you know, I took an oath. The key phrase of that oath says that I will “protect and serve the Constitution of the United States of America against all enemies, foreign and domestic”. ALL enemies…foreign and DOMESTIC! And I don’t know about all of you, but my Oath of Enlistment did not come with an expiration date.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Until now I have only defended our rights by writing our elected officials. I have written everyone from my local Congressman, to my State Senators, clear up to the President of the United States (and I use this title loosely) himself. I’ve found that as an individual, words whether voiced or written, seem to fall on deaf ears.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Now as a member of Oath Keepers, I hope to have more influence trying to enlighten fellow Americans who still follow as mindless rodents being lured by the “Pied Piper” to their proverbial deaths. And maybe…we can show those we have put in office that it is the voice of the people they should be following and not their own agendas. There is strength in numbers!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Thank you for listening to my rant, and thank you for having me as a member…</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">—————————————————————————-</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Ice Pick:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Testimonial: *************The US Constitution shall prevail!**************</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I shall not rest-easy until the Rule of Law is re-established and secured in this country. The use of government as a Means to establish and enforce the moral code is destroying this country and that is unacceptable; I believe the roles of all levels of government should only be employed as an End.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Nothing has ever led me to believe that I should somehow be spared the sublime duty of defending the Judeo-Christian values upon which this country was formed; I shall fulfill my duty to the utmost of my ability until my death, just as so many Americans and their families have done before me.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I honor, respect, and hold dear the constitutional rights of every US Citizen (especially the unborn!), regardless of their constrained or unconstrained visions for America, or which side of the peaceful-political ideology they find themselves on. I will readily defend the basic human rights; life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Expecting a number of very-tough years ahead of us, I’ll do my best to uphold the Ranger Creed and adhere to Robert Roger’s standing Ranger’s orders.</p>
<p>So Help Me God</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Andrew DaSilva:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Testimonial: I chose to become a member of this organization for many reasons. Knowing that your part of something that’s bigger than you are, and that you’re surrounded by like minded individuals that are willing to fight for this country and what’s right, but more so for what the belive in. What is it that we all belive in you might ask? We belive in this country and what our forefathers put in motion to ensure that this country is in fact the land of the free and the home of the brave. What we all believe in is The Unites States of America!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">—————————————————————————-</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Peter:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Testimonial: Who said “the history of warfare can be summed up in two words, “too late”? Too late in recognizing the deadly intentions of an enemy, too late in uniting with ones friends, “too late”.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">General Douglas MacArthur</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Looks like history is always doomed to repeat itself. I hope I spelled his name right.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">———————————————————————————-</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Ricky Cromer Sr:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Testimonial: The oath I took was to defend the constitution against all enemies foreign or domestic, and to defend this great nation against tyranny whether it be outside our borders or inside our borders. I promised to defend my family so they will have to fight no more. This was once a great nation that has fallen to the government and foreigners. I served during the gulf war and during peace time in the guards and in Europe. We need to take our country back from the foreign opposition and make it a great nation once again. Fight on brothers, and give us our freedom back, as it once was. I support everything you do.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Brother in Arms SPECIALIST RICKY CROMER SR.</p>

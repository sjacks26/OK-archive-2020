<p><a href="http://www.sott.net/article/228453-DMSO-The-Real-Miracle-Solution" rel="nofollow">http://www.sott.net/article/228453-DMSO-The-Real-Miracle-Solution</a></p>
<p>VOf all the areas in which dimethyl sulfoxide might be used, the public seems to be most interested in applying it for various forms of arthritis, however, informed health professional know that the solvent has a vast array of other applications. In fact, in the medical and pharmaceutical literature this product is declared to have the widest range and greatest number of therapeutic chemical uses.</p>
<p>Since there are several hundred therapeutic uses of DMSO, the following is merely a partial listing of its myriad applications for the consumer’s medical armamentarium:</p>
<p>Brain and spinal cord damage<br/>
In the same way that DMSO reserves the effects of embolic or hemorrhagic stroke, it is superior to any other treatment for high velocity missile (gunshot) wounds to the brain. It’s necessary to employ DMSO by mouth and intravenously as soon as possible after the head wound occurs. The healing qualities of DMSO also work quickly to bring injured spinal cord tissues back to normal.</p>
<p>Down’s syndrome<br/>
DMSO administered as a 50 percent diluted drink given in the equivalent of one half of a gram per Kg. to affected children brought them back to normal. It is utilized orally throughout Argentina and Chile for the treatment of Down’s syndrome and mental retardation.</p>
<p>Sciatica and lumbar disc problems<br/>
When 20 to 50 cc of 20 percent DMSO combined with the local anesthetic Xylocaine are injected for three to five consecutive days intramuscularly into a painful back area, the pain disappears and remains gone for longer intervals between series of injections. A 20 percent strength of pharmaceutical grade DMSO injected into diseased spinal discs rids the patient of nerve pain from the damaged discs.</p>
<p>Keloids, scars, acne, and burns<br/>
Applied topically and repeatedly, DMSO flattens the raised, nodular, lobulated liner mass of scar tissue in keloids and acne. It takes away much of their discoloration too. And for eliminating the pain of burns of all types, nothing is better.</p>
<p>musculoskeltal and sports injuries<br/>
Full -strength DMSO painted on sprained anklets, pulled muscle, dislocated joints and even at the site of simple fractures takes away their pain like magic. It’s main healing tool for trainers and coaches of professional athletes. Surprisingly, when applied topically, DMSO is better tolerated in higher concentrations below the waist rather than above the waist. Yet it is more effective above the waist, having the quickest response for problems involving the face, neck, shoulders, upper limbs and upper back and trunk. It should be used with a concern for side effects such as the sensation of burning. The solution’s concentration should be lowered if any discomfort occurs.</p>
<p>Foot – disorders<br/>
Among greatest patient successes was the application of topical DMSO for the pain relief of corns, calluses, bunions, hammertoes, ingrown toenails, planter warts, and fissures between the toes.</p>
<p>There are hundreds of patients with various ailments who have been successfully treated with Intravenous as well as topical applications of DMSO both in India and abroad. In addition, the DMSO-hematoxylon formulation, along with certain herbs, has been successfully used in treating cancer patients.</p>
<p>Cancer<br/>
As an excellent adjunct in metabolic cancer therapy, DMSO potentates chemotherapy. DMSO and hamatoxylon administered intravenously as a combination have excellent tumor shrinking qualities. The mixture is especially corrective for adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, prostate cancer, breast cancer, lymphoma and some other solid tumors.</p>
<p>Diabetes<br/>
DMSO taken by mouth lessens the need for insulin in one out of four persons with juvenile diabetes. Also, DMSO given IV improves the peripheral vascular blood supply of diabetics by dilating smaller vessels of the lower limbs</p>
<p>Nasal sinusistis, tic douboureaus, and headache<br/>
Placed directly into the nostrils, DMSO opens blocked sinuses in a few minutes. It does this by crossing all membranes of the body without destroying tissue integrity.</p>
<p>For tic douloureaus, topically applied DMSO brings relief within four days, but it is faster and more lasting when injected directly into the spasmotic muscle’s trigger points.</p>
<p>Employed topically to the forehead and back of the neck, DMSO should take away headaches within thirty minutes.</p>
<p>Skin diseases, ulcerations, and external herpes<br/>
Such skin difficulties as pityriasis rosa, tinea versicolor and eczematoid determatitis clears up by the topical applications of DMSO. Additionally, there will be rapid healing of chronic varicose ulcers, diabetic ulcers and ulcerations related to mycotic infections.</p>
<p>DMSO painted onto the painful lesions connected with herpes zoster (shingles) will remove their neurological symptoms at once. It works well when put on the cold sores of herpes simplex as well.</p>
<p>Cataracts and other eye problems<br/>
An ophthalmologist has developed a formula for dissolving cataracts without surgery. Combining DMSO with super oxide dismutase (SOD), this eye doctor’s formulation works against glaucoma too.</p>
<p>There are hundreds of patients with various ailments who have been successfully treated with intravenous as well as topical applications of DMSO both in India and abroad. In addition, the DMSO-hematoxylon formulation, along with certain herbs, has been successfully used in treating cancer patients.</p>
<p>Life is short, take advantage of real benefits in science outside the medical tyranny of FDA, insurance and big pharma.</p>
<p>ΜΟΛΩΝ ΛΑΒΕ<br/>
It is our determination to not strike the first blow, but also to not stand mute and allow our loved ones, and all that we believe in and stand for, to be trampled by men who would deprive us of our God-given – or natural, if you will – rights to suit their own ends.</p>

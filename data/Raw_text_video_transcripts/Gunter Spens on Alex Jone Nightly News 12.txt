## Alex Jones; Guenter Spens

AJ: Welcome back to the second half of Nightly News. Guenter Spens is our guest. He lives in Dallas, has been in the US for 13 years. Came as a software engineer for oil companies. He was a lieutenant colonel during the military stand down in East Germany, which has been vaunted for its surveillance police state. The US has surpassed East Germany in many respects. He’s here to break down his experiences there and parallels that he sees in the West, torture, secret arrest, drones.

## GS is wearing an OK shirt

AJ: You were making a lot of great points over coffee and water that you didn’t make on the radio yesterday. We started bad in East Germany with no rights, then developed some and stood down. The US is going the opposite direction, starting with all these great rights, the people are the power. In your own words, break down where we left off on the radio with the parallels here in the West.

GS: (0:01:37.5) I was born in 1952. In the beginning of East Germany – GDR – the party was in total power. The law was in place, the constitution was in place, but the party ignored everything. So when you criticized the party or the government, which was the same, you disappeared. No rights at all. Later, you had more and more rights. On the side of the border was West Germany. East Germany was not accepted from the beginning as a country. They had to have good documents and look nice (0:02:23.0).

AJ: So for public relations. Kind of like the UN claims all these rights but takes them away in Article 30.

GS: The party had to change gradually, the people got more rights. The Stasi, the secret service, was still in power, but it had to, like following the rules and the law.

AJ: Pay lip service.

GS: Yes. When they arrest you, they had to find a reason, which was easy (0:02:51.2). In the beginning, they did not even have to have or show you a reason or tell you one. Here, the US started with a constitution, the best ever written in history. When you see what’s going on, Patriot Act, you lose more and more rights. Many laws are against the Constitution. The Patriot Act is absolutely against the Constitution. The Patriot Act is the same we had when the party was in absolute power (0:03:22.5), because they just lock you up if they want. They don’t tell you a reason.

AJ: So you’re saying our Patriot Act is how East Germany started, when it was even more draconian. People over time demanded more liberties, it was that 40 year process until it fell. I’ve studied history, I didn’t live in East Germany but I’ve looked at other nations. Only North Korea on the books has stuff on the books like what we have on the books. Hitler, Stalin, Mao and others wouldn’t put the things we put on the books. Our government puts things like the NDAA, where they say citizens can disappear, never be seen again, military can be used against you. They went to the Senators who authorized it and said does it really say this and they all said yes it does (0:04:03.4). Even the media couldn’t believe it, then it passed 93-7 in the Senate. It turned out Obama had demanded it be in there. Just to recap what you said on the radio, the US on paper has less rights and freedoms now, is going in the opposite direction of how we started, is actually starting to dwarf East Germany.

GS: Yes, that’s exactly what I see here. (0:04:32.5) I watch politics, I have to watch it, I’ve been here 13 years, it was completely new for me. I read the Constitution. When you see the Patriot Act and the Constitution, no. They cannot lock you away. You have the right for trial, to see evidence against you. This is no more necessary.

AJ: You teach constitution classes now.

GS: Yes

AJ: That’s awesome. Continuing the parallels, from what East Germany was like and what you see happening here. 

GS: E Germany, was completely power of the party, but it changed over time. The Constitution from E Germany was actually a good written document, clear. But all constitutions are, even in E Germany, was designed or written to tell the government and define how the government can rule the people. The Constitution of the United States is completely different. The Constitution starts with We the People. It is written for the people and regulates the right of the government. (0:05:34.9) The government has not much right. The states have a lot of rights. Bill of Rights. Government not. But the government gets all the rights, even from the states and the people.

AJ: What you’re saying is key here. I’ll show people a drawing of this. In a draconian system, the constitution can say whatever it wants, but the government has all the rights at the top, and it’s all about the government’s power over the population, down here. Instead, in our Republic, it’s all about the people at the top and the government and the system is under them. The Constitution bounds down the government, not the other way around. 

GS: The government has to serve the people, by our Constitution. In E Germany, it was a different way. 

AJ: Exactly. You can have all the great things you say, but if the government is still in control, it can do whatever it wants, it can violate it.

GS: They tell you what you have to do exactly. No way around. There was a time in E Germany when you would move from one city to another, you would need authorization and permission to do so. No more at the end, at the beginning, total control. It changed piece by piece. At the end, people were able to go into the street and have a rally against the party, against the government (0:07:13.8).

AJ: We’re gonna talk about the fall of the communist system in E Germany. I want to get into the parallels first. Again, continuing the drawing here, here is authoritarianism, on this side. Then you’ve got on this side the Constitution, Bill of Rights, the flower, the renaissance, the awakening, all the liberties. What homeland security is pushing is diametrically opposed to what the republic was set up on. You’ve got tyranny here and the republic here, two completely separate things. This states Declaration of Independence. It’s not just a right, it’s a duty to overthrow this [tyranny] (0:07:58.8). Governments are constituted amongst men, and that it comes from the people. This [tyranny] is saying the state can do whatever it wants. It’s really simple when you actually look at it.

GS: Yes, and it happens on a daily basis.

AJ: I could ask a lot of questions here, but I want you to get into other parallels, points, warnings. You’re here speaking out because you want to warn Americans, because you’ve experienced authoritarianism.

GS: (0:08:28.7) For example, America, land of the free. Sounds good. But when the police see me with this shirt, this actually means I’m an Oath Keeper, and OK means you took an oath to defend the Constitution of the American people. When you stand to this, you’re afraid. One police officer told me, I asked him if there was a problem with it. He came back and said I don’t want to become a target. He’s afraid to become a target when he speaks out for the Constitution. (0:08:58.9) Friends of mine say, oh you’re an OK, you should step back, you will lose all your freedom. There’s no freedom to lose if this is the case, it’s already lost.

AJ: Exactly. You don’t get your freedom by groveling to tyrants. You only have freedom by demanding it. 

GS: When you see Patriot Act. I guess Thomas Jefferson said, when you exchange security for liberty, you will have none of them.

AJ: History shows that. (0:09:29.7) What got you politically aware and concerned to start speaking out?

GS: When you say let’s save the Constitution, you become a terrorist. When you are a soldier and come back, a returning veteran, DHS said they are potential terrorists. This cannot be.

AJ: They are guilty until proven innocent.

GS: No question. You lose all your rights. You can be arrested for any reason. You may be on lists. It can be used against you later. Why? (0:10:13.1) As long as you are not convicted for a crime, there is no reason. 

AJ: You’re an OK because you moved here as a software engineer. You like Dallas, Texas, America. You’ve already been an OK. You were there as a lieutenant colonel, in the main city where the stand down began, where the Berlin Wall fell.

GS: (0:10:41.1) It started in Leipzig. I knew about it, I was still in the Army. I was there on Monday, watching. Later, I joined them, not in uniform of course. Many of our officers joined them on the streets. In regulations in the Army, you did not have to obey any order against the Constitution, against our people, or against common international law. It was pretty clear. 

AJ: You were telling me when it began, they did whatever they wanted. Slowly, people demanded more rights, until they created a constitution but still tried to ignore it. You guys said no, we’re not supposed to fire on our own citizens for no reason. (0:11:36.5) Previously, it’s famous, they would machine gun people trying to get out of E Germany.

GS: Absolutely. The border was closed since 1961, August 13. At the beginning, a lot of people who tried to leave were killed at the border. Later, no one tried anymore, they found different ways. Embassy and other countries. This became a big problem for E Germany. [hard to understand the next sentence] The party has not the power to go against it. You put the paramilitary out with AK47s without ammunition, just to make a statement. Later they tried to use the army. Finally, in November 1989, there was 150k people on the street, peaceful.

AJ: Here are some pictures of the wall. Does that bring back memories? (0:13:11.4)

GS: Yes, I’ve seen it. I’ve been at the wall.

AJ: Before we get to more parallels, we didn’t flesh out. I read about the Stasi scattering like roaches after the wall fell. The authoritarians, the control freaks. But you said they already started disappearing before.

GS: Yes. It was a problem I had later. I left the army in July, but had to stay until the end of November, it’s like the fiscal year. I had my documents, but not out yet. Stasi were gone in the spring and moved their people from the Stasi to the army. They moved out into key positions in the economy. The idea was we’re still there in power, even after the regime changed.

AJ: (0:14:26.2) It’s like a sleeper network.

GS: Yes.

AJ: A stay-behind network.

GS: They called them officers in special service. This was the same time I got my documents. I left the army, normally I could not leave the army, I had to stay 25 years.

AJ: Just to be clear, were the Stasi all routed out? I know a lot of them came over here and run Homeland Security, that’s not a joke folks.

GS: Yes, in completely different directions. Some in the army, some in other places. But the Stasi existed until the end, officially. Just they moved a lot of people out, put them in other positions for later.

AJ: (0:15:14.9) We showed a picture of a man machine gunned trying to get over the wall, not into another country but into his own country. That’d be like putting a wall up the Mississippi, blocking the East from the West. This is not like people trying to come in from Canada or Mexico. Expanding on that, I know they killed and tortured a lot of people. I want to get your view on the film, The Lives of Others. Having control over what kinds of films can be made, demanding favors. The type that worked for the system, that enjoyed that corrupt power. The Mafia never did too well in Texas, if you tried to shake somebody down here, they’d just kill you. My question, what about Stasi being hunted down by people they hurt? In any system, if somebody did something to your wife or children, you’re going to kill them, even if you don’t have a gun. I’m gonna beat their brains out. What happened in the oppression there, did people ever fight back?

GS: This never happened (0:16:19.6). No one in E Germany had guns, no firearms in the whole country. Not even Army officers had a gun at home. I was the exception, it depended on your service. There was no power for the people to use. It changed piece by piece as you got more rights. You had to provide some evidence.

AJ: So even though people were disarmed, they put pressure on the government to provide more liberty. 

GS: It would have been different if W Germany didn’t exist. Families were separated by the border. They had contact. You could see TV from W Germany. 

AJ: You were telling me that was illegal.

GS: (0:17:26.7) Yes, it was illegal for officers, police, army, and teachers.

AJ: Didn’t that make people want to then?

GS: Of course.

AJ: You probably misunderstood what I said, I talk fast, language barrier. I’m saying gun or not, you did something to my family, I can kill people with my bare hands, with a hammer, a knife. Did people ever strike back?

GS: Never (0:17:55.0). It started with total power. If you tried to strike back, you’d be gone.

AJ: That’s right. Germany had been completely bombed, Stalinist Russia had taken over. What was the real control of Russia over E Germany? How did that work through the Stasi and the government?

GS: It changed over time. The Stasi and government worked together. The Stasi and other services, like the KGB, worked together. When I moved for vacation, I had to apply and tell them when I would go and what checkpoint I would use. Because they checked my documents. Our government knew exactly where I crossed the border, where I am. Total control. 

AJ: So the Soviet GRU and KGB just all came together.

GS: Worked very well together (0:19:05.6). At the end, the Stasi moved most of their documents, including about me, to Romania, just to keep it away.

AJ: We didn’t talk about that. Your revolution was peaceful. The military stood down and said no. It wasn’t an attempted coup like the Weimar and the military against Hitler. What about Romania, that was where the military stood down and they killed Ceaușescu.

GS: Yes, that was completely different. Ceaușescu tried to use the army. His Stasi was on his side, but the army refused (0:19:53.0) and later went against his for the people. They supported the people.

AJ: He was terrible obviously, some would say worse than what was in E Germany. But that’s a lesson. That’s why the police and military are so important. They’re where the rubber meets the road. Tyranny will come to your door in a uniform. (0:20:16.2)

GS: The army should never go against their own people. When they say the army can be used to arrest some people, it’s not right. We have law enforcement for that, you don’t need the army in their own country to arrest their own people (0:20:39.0).

AJ: You mentioned people being secretly arrested and disappearing in the early years of E Germany. Now, America’s going in the direction of tyranny, E Germany was going in the direction of liberty. In our last minutes, I want you to have the floor, as a constitution teacher, as someone who loves liberty. From your experiences, you’re here to warn America about the parallels you see. You’re saying America has surpassed what you grew up in, what you were a colonel in. Tie it all together with the choice our military, police, and others have to make. (0:21:31.9)

GS: In E Germany, the army had clear orders not to go against our people. The party tried to use all their power, but we got more liberty and riots. When I look here, I watch politics closely. I read the Constitution, Declaration of Independence, Bill of Rights. I have a green card, I thought I would apply for citizenship. When the time came, I decided not to apply because of the Patriot Act. It’s similar to what I know from the beginning of E Germany. You can be locked up, they don’t give you a reason. This cannot be. It’s against the Constitution. (0:22:51.8) It’s the duty of every American to read and understand the Constitution. It’s violated almost every day. When it comes to the point that people are afraid to speak the truth, they don’t want to become a target or lose their liberty or rights or freedom, something is wrong. It’s getting worse and worse. I have seen this before (0:23:30.9). As time went by, we got more liberty, at the end the party was out of office in a peaceful way. Here it looks completely different. The army will be used against the people. You don’t know the Constitution, you don’t know your rights, the Bill of Rights, the rights of states. You don’t realize you are losing it until it’s too late. (0:24:02.6) You get arrested for no reason. The Constitution is clear, you have the right to a trial, they have to provide evidence, not just take someone and lock them up. This is going on here. We’re going in the wrong direction. People are afraid to speak out (0:24:35.9). The Constitution is why America is the greatest country in the world. Not by taking people’s rights away. It happens. It’s the duty of every American to read and understand the Constitution, it’s the law of the land.

AJ: To use another German parallel, look at Hitler. There was the Weimar Republic, modeled after the US, but Hitler got in through the system and dismantled it. It’s another example, you get rid of your constitution and bill of rights, binding down the government, and it’s over. You’re always going to have bad people who want to abuse things (0:25:31.9).

GS: The Constitution is there to keep the government on their level, keep them from grabbing all the power. Government is not there to control our lives. Every government in the world tries to gain rights and power. 

AJ: What did you think of the film, The Lives of Others?

GS: (0:26:07.3) Very interesting, it really happens. It goes back into time.

AJ: It’s based loosely on a true story, right?

GS: Yes, it’s a true story. They try to collect all information, every government does. The question is how to use it. You should try to use it. When the government collects all information, for what reason? To use it, if they need it. If they need to lock you up, they have something to use against you. (0:26:46.0) In E Germany, this was very organized. They had 80k, for 16 million people, working for the Stasi. Just like here, you have to report your neighbor if there is something suspicious, something against the government.

AJ: If something’s really bad, I know to report it. This idea of report everything, they’re trying to, the snitch culture in America is really bad. It’s this idea of report everything, but don’t report anything on the government. You criticize that, I have an article here about a sheriff who had a secret meeting with the citizens of the town about small government terrorists, and they tell them the Tea Party are terrorists. You’re not a terrorist for supporting what the Founders set up. Even if they were calling socialists, who I don’t agree with, terrorists, that’s wrong. Even if I disagree with someone’s politics, it’s their right. It’s always the socialist and the collectivist that try to restrict our speech.

GS: Exactly.

AJ: Why is that? You lived under it? (0:28:06.8)

GS: Just power. They want to grab as much power as they can, every government is. Not just here, but here it’s happening extremely. It should not happen here, because the Constitution avoids this.

AJ: America has been the enemy of the mega-elite of the banks. They’re taking the time to take us over, that’s why they want us to be dependent. How did E Germany keep you dependent?

GS: (0:28:35.2) A lot of ways. We depended on the government for retirement. When you try to go to another country for vacation, the government might not let you. If you’re an athlete and there was a competition in West Germany, you had to work with the Stasi or they wouldn’t let you go.

AJ: You’re treated like children.

GS: Yes

AJ: Walked around by the government minders. Which they’re doing under Homeland Security, groping us, training us. You said they took money out of your check but have a social security system. That’s communist. E Germany, the parallels with this ultimate evil we’re told, you go down the list it’s everything America does now. (0:29:25.7) Give me the doc cam again guys. Every line, progressive income tax, that’s in the Communist Manifesto. Social Security, government controls your pension, have that. Public school, have that. Giant federal power grab, have that. Government department of agriculture, have that. Rural affairs. Surveillance, cameras on street corners. Secret Police. International check points. Torture – nobody puts it on paper but America (0:30:00.1). You go right down the line. Big empire, invading all these countries. Control of education, exactly.

GS: Education was under the party in E Germany, same as here.

AJ: Obsessed with education, which really means brainwashing.

GS: You make them dependent when you have their retirement, they had a limit. A teacher is paid the same, but he got a special retirement deal if he taught until he retired, if he got fired he lost it. (0:30:56.0)

AJ: It’s stealing your money.

GS: They are dependent. When they would teach different things, against the party, they would be fired.

AJ: All that money had been stolen.

GS: It was different in the army. I had retirement, but I had to pay for it, it was not a gift. If you worked on computers, you had to be checked by the Stasi.

AJ: They announced this 8, 9 years ago on CSPAN. Now it’s started with the unions, who are communist – I’m not saying unions themselves are bad but they’re now globalist tools. In Homeland Security, you have to have a background check to work in the unions. In Homeland Security, to fly you have to pass a check. There’s no judge, jury, conviction, it’s a no-fly list. It’s all about being able to travel, to work, it’s all up to Homeland Security. Is Homeland Security the US Stasi? (0:32:11.0)

GS: It looks exactly like. If you see what Napolitano said, she said returning soldiers are potential terrorists. You can fight for the country, when you’re back you’re a terrorist.

AJ: I say she is a terrorist.

GS: She is one, yes. [Laughing] This cannot be. Everything that made America grow big and great now becomes. You may be a terrorist when you do this.

AJ: Being a real American, what made the country great is now the enemy.

GS: Yes

AJ: Because they’re a bunch of globalist, corporate-hired thugs that bring authoritarianism in. They’re the enemy. It’s so obvious. If Russians parachuted in and said George Washington was a pig, we’d say you’re the enemy. But because they speak like Americans. I actually have the manuals where they demonize the Founding Fathers. They’re obviously the enemy (0:33:15.4).

GS: Take the no-fly list. You can be on the no-fly list and have no idea until you try to fly.

AJ: No due process. Same thing of just disappearing.

GS: Exactly the same. You go to the airport, you cannot fly. For what? No one told me. When you criticize maybe the government, this is your right. When you do this, you are maybe on a list. Maybe you’re automatically on the no-fly list and don’t know it.

AJ: You hit the key here. We’re on the verge of tyranny. They’ve set up all these draconian things. They put torture, secret arrest out like it’s a good thing. They’re trying to sell it. They haven’t implemented it all yet. They’re just starting. We have to decry it. We have to say no right now, or my god it’s going to be a horrible road.

GS: (0:34:13.5) It cannot be that Congress passes laws against the Constitution. They should know, they took their oath of office to defend the Constitution. Everyone in the government did this. Many of them have no idea what’s in the Constitution. (0:34:30.1)

AJ: From your experience in E Europe, tyranny will fall. No matter how much high tech bull they have.

GS: Finally, yes. But the point is here, the start was pretty good, liberty, freedom, land of the free. Now it goes the other direction. I see no way back. The more you lose the Constitution, the harder it will be to get it back. When you lose it, it’s gone. Try to reduce the government, I don’t think so, the government, the Congress won’t vote for that. It has to be reduced by the people. By the power of the people. In Germany, it was changed by the people on the street (0:35:24.6).

AJ: This has been a conscious move by the social engineers. They know that as tyranny comes in, people are going to get mad. They put in a repressive system to get ready for that. It’s so cold-blooded, so calculating. To see the stuff we’re putting into law, even North Korea doesn’t put into law that they can secretly arrest people and kill you. Only our government does it and hides it in plain view. The bigger they are, the harder the fall. Or the better they are, when they turn evil, the worse it is.

GS: (0:35:52.3) It can happen here because no one realizes. It cannot be that a law against the Constitution passes Congress. No one recognizes it.

AJ: That’s my question. How can I have all these training manuals and videos where they sit there, FEMA, with a straight face and say freedom is bad, Founders are bad, Ron Paul is bad, returning veterans are the enemy – cause they know veterans might fight back against them. They know the military turned against Ceaușescu, against E Germany, tried to turn against Hitler. They know the Chinese military finally turned against Mao. That’s why they say the military’s the enemy.

GS: (0:36:36.7) There are 22 million veterans in the US. Most have guns and know how to use them. I guess they’re well organized. They’re afraid of veterans, therefore veterans are categorized as terrorists. When you’re a terrorist, they can lock you up or do anything.

AJ: And spy on you, anything else. Anything else you’d like to say?

GS: I repeat, it’s the duty of every American to read and understand the Constitution and what’s going on in the country. It cannot be the Patriot Act. They can use this against you, it’s why they have it.

AJ: You’ve lived it, you know it when you see it.

GS: Yes. You can see it clearly. I’ve been here 13 years, but this is still new for me. 

AJ: Have you seen the US change a lot in 13 years?  GS: Yes, a lot. Try to fly, compare with 13 years ago. Completely different, you could just go in.

AJ: You said on the radio, that you guys didn’t have checkpoints in E Germany except on the border. You said the E Germans never would have put up with being groped.

GS: No. (0:38:12.2)

AJ: It would have been a revolt. Americans put up with stuff E Germans wouldn’t have put up with. Who went through a war, the whole country being bombed, the Soviets taking over, reeducation, and you wouldn’t put up with it, but we do. But we’re free, so this must not be tyranny.

GS: This cannot be. There’s liberty and freedom. You cannot change liberty for freedom, you will have nothing.

AJ: They always say, we’re taking your rights to keep you safe.

GS: No. This cannot be. When they take rights away, to make you safe, something is wrong.

AJ: Like you said, the police officer who saw your shirt at the gun show. You finally said what’s the problem, he said I don’t want to be on a list. He wanted to say hi to you but he was scared. He knows he’s living in tyranny.

GS: He knows it. He’s afraid. (0:39:08.6) 

AJ: They have brainwashing sessions. I have videos, Road to Tyranny. They say George Washington, Thomas Jefferson is bad.

GS: I know this.

AJ: Even I couldn’t believe it. Then I got the manuals. Imagine with a straight face, George Washington is evil, Thomas Jefferson is evil, people that want freedom are bad. I got new documents this week, people who think the government is becoming illegitimate, they are terrorists. It’s like, that’s the enemy. When someone says freedom is bad, that’s the bad guy.

GS: Yes. This should be. But everyone is afraid to say the truth.

AJ: So we gotta have courage.

GS: Yes

AJ: Guenter Spens, thank you so much. How can people get in touch with you?

GS: Via OK.

<p>There are very few legitimate cultural divisions in the world. Most of them are arbitrarily created, not only by political and financial elites, but also by the useful idiots and mindless acolytes infesting the sullied halls of academia.</p>
<p>It is perhaps no mistake that cultural Marxists in the form of “social justice warriors”, PC busybodies and feminists tend to create artificial divisions between people and “classes” while attacking and homogenizing very real and natural divisions between individuals based on biological reality and inherent genetic and psychological ability. This is what cultural Marxists do: divide and conquer or homogenize and conquer, whatever the situation happens to call for.</p>
<p>They do this most commonly by designated arbitrary “victim status” to various classes, thus dividing them from each other based on how “oppressed” they supposedly are.  The less statistically prominent a particular group is (less represented in a job field, media, education, population, etc.) in any western society based on their color, ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender, etc., generally the more victim group status is afforded to them by social justice gatekeepers.  Whites and males (straight males) are of course far at the bottom of their list of people who have reason to complain and we are repeatedly targeted by SJW organizations and web mobs as purveyors of some absurd theory called “the patriarchy”.</p>
<p>Although cultural marxism does indeed target every individual and harm every individual in the long run, my list of personal solutions outlined in this article will be directed in large part at the categories of people most attacked by the social justice cult today.</p>
<p>I do not write often about PC cultism and social justice because the movement is only a symptom of a greater problem, namely the problem of collectivism. The only true and concrete social (group) division is the division between collectivists and individualists: between those who believe the individual should be subservient to the group mind and those who believe the group is meaningless without the individual mind.</p>
<p>I have already spoken on the root dangers and logical inconsistencies of the social justice cult in articles such as <a href="http://www.alt-market.com/articles/2001-the-twisted-motives-behind-political-correctness" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.alt-market.com/articles/2001-the-twisted-motives-behind-political-correctness', '‘The Twisted Motives Behind Political Correctness’');">‘The Twisted Motives Behind Political Correctness’</a> and <a href="http://www.alt-market.com/articles/2642-the-future-costs-of-politically-correct-cultism" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.alt-market.com/articles/2642-the-future-costs-of-politically-correct-cultism', '‘The Future Costs Of Politically Correct Cultism.’');">‘The Future Costs Of Politically Correct Cultism.’</a></p>
<p>There are many intelligent commentators on the Web who have consistently demolished the PC mob with reason and logic, and I leave that battle to them. In this article I would like to continue my examination but with the goal of presenting some real and tangible solutions. And like most solutions to most problems, it is the individual who is required to draw the line in the sand and change the way he approaches the realm of cultural Marxism. It is not up to groups, organizations or governments.</p>
<p>First, let’s be clear, cultural Marxism has already done most of the damage it can possibly do to our way of life. And by damage, I mean the end of long-standing foundational pillars of society that provide stability and prosperity, including traditional marriage (not government-licensed marriage), family, gender “roles,” etc. (which cultural Marxists openly boast about tearing down).</p>
<p>In Western nations <a href="http://www.bcmj.org/articles/silent-epidemic-male-suicide" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.bcmj.org/articles/silent-epidemic-male-suicide', 'male suicide rates');" target="_blank">male suicide rates</a> are way up. Women’s proclaimed levels of happiness and contentment are <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-1189894/Women-happy-years-ago-.html" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-1189894/Women-happy-years-ago-.html', 'way down');" target="_blank">way down</a>, despite the fact that they have had wage equality for decades (yes, the wage gap is a perpetually pontificated Lochness monster-sized myth that was debunked years ago by economists like Thomas Sowell), despite the fact that they have surpassed men in educational participation and despite the fact that they have total control over family planning.</p>

<p>Marriage rates are at historic lows since the 1970s and the rise of social justice activism. Of course, the argument is often presented that economic decline has more to do with this than cultural Marxism. However, setting aside the rising tide of men who fear being bled dry through divorce settlements based on double standards, the West’s economic decline (and thus marriage decline) can be correlated to the increase in overt debt spending. And debt spending is driven <a href="http://alt-market.com/articles/2539-one-last-look-at-the-real-economy-before-it-implodes-part-3" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://alt-market.com/articles/2539-one-last-look-at-the-real-economy-before-it-implodes-part-3', 'directly by socialist legislation');">directly by socialist legislation</a>, entitlement programs and social welfare addiction, more so even than it can be correlated to military spending.</p>
<p>Therefore, cultural Marxism and its vicious attempts to forcefully “harmonize” wealth through taxation and welfare have indeed caused the very <a href="http://personalliberty.com/magic-establishment-economics/" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://personalliberty.com/magic-establishment-economics/', 'economic conditions');" rel="”nofollow”" target="_blank">economic conditions</a> by which marriage is made untenable and families are made unstable.</p>
<p>While women become more and more unhappy, men and masculinity are essentially demonized by cultural Marxists (mainly feminists) as “toxic.” This propaganda campaign has been so successful that men in many first world nations are beginning to pursue, for all intents and purposes, an <a href="http://www.breitbart.com/london/2014/12/04/the-sexodus-part-1-the-men-giving-up-on-women-and-checking-out-of-society/" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.breitbart.com/london/2014/12/04/the-sexodus-part-1-the-men-giving-up-on-women-and-checking-out-of-society/', 'asexual lifestyle');" target="_blank">asexual lifestyle</a> safer from collectivist intrusions and judgments.</p>
<p>As if the psychological browbeating were not enough, the <a href="http://www.naturalnews.com/047600_xenoestrogens_feminization_endocrine_disruptors.html" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.naturalnews.com/047600_xenoestrogens_feminization_endocrine_disruptors.html', 'chemistry');" target="_blank">chemistry</a> of the male body is also being warped by estrogen-imitating chemicals present in industrial products, plastics and soy-based foods. A decline in normal levels of male <a href="https://www.endocrine.org/news-room/press-release-archives/2006/testosterone_lvls_in_men_decline" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'https://www.endocrine.org/news-room/press-release-archives/2006/testosterone_lvls_in_men_decline', 'testosterone');" target="_blank">testosterone</a> and an ever increasing hormonal feminization of younger generations of men and boys is becoming prevalent.</p>
<p>Indirect chemical influences aren’t the only threat. Direct drugging of boys (with far greater frequency than girls) with <a href="http://www.esquire.com/news-politics/a32858/drugging-of-the-american-boy-0414/" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.esquire.com/news-politics/a32858/drugging-of-the-american-boy-0414/', 'psychotropics');" target="_blank">psychotropics</a> in order to subdue their natural tendencies towards physicality and frenetic activity is epidemic in public schools, all with the goal of making boys behave more like girls.</p>
<p>Finally, the erasure of free speech and thought is always the holy grail of cultural Marxists; but this is not always done through government power — at least not right away. Social justice cultists rely more on collective pressure and public shaming tactics to engineer an environment in which people feel compelled to self-censor rather than deal with the hailstorm of witch hunters and wagging fingers.</p>
<p>Cultural Marxists do use government force to police what they consider thought crimes, but usually in an incremental manner. One day, it’s the use of government to demand associations, as with a Christian-owned cake business being forced to work for another party that feels entitled to a gay wedding cake. Another day, it might be a public school being forced to allow boys dressed as girls in the girls’ bathroom or locker room. Another day, it might be the implementation of lowered standards and quotas to force businesses to hire people with victim-group status, even if they are unqualified for the job.</p>
<p>All of these actions impede upon the individual freedoms and privacy rights of others, all under the guise of “equality.” And because cultural Marxists need to constantly observe ever greater modes of oppression and inequality in order to justify their existence, the impositions on individual liberty will never end. Today, people may argue that such violations are “minor” and not to be concerned over. It is happening to strangers or distant neighbors, not to them; so why should they care? Liberty movement champions know full well why this thinking is idiotic; the trampling of one person’s individual liberties is the trampling of ALL people’s individual liberties. Totalitarianism is a virus that feeds on one person to the next until everyone is on the menu.</p>
<p>It is not enough anymore to simply continue pointing out the insanity of political correctness; we must also take useful steps toward reversing the destruction already wrought.</p>
<p>And so, here are my solutions, which must be enacted by individuals in their daily lives regardless of the potential backlash. Do you have leftist leaning friends or family members? It doesn’t matter. Are you employed in a workplace crawling with social justice ideologues? Stop seeing them as part of the equation because they do not matter. Worried about losing a relationship if you make a stand? Say good riddance. This is what must be done by free thinkers if they are to counter and reverse the collectivist nightmare of cultural Marxism.</p>
<p><strong>Feel no shame:</strong> Social justice relies on shaming tactics, usually by slandering an opponent with a label that does not really apply to him, in order to control his arguments and behavior. If you don’t care about being called a bigot, a racist, a sexist, a misogynist, a homophobe, etc., then there is not really much that they can do to you.</p>
<p><strong>Do not self-censor:</strong> This does not mean you should go out of your way to be antagonistic or act like an ass, but the thought police have power only if you give power to them. Say what you want to say when you want to say it, and do it with a smile. Let the PC police froth and scream until they have an aneurism. Cultural Marxists are generally weaklings. They avoid physical confrontation like they avoid logic, so why fear them?</p>
<p><strong>Realize there is no such thing as white privilege or male privilege:</strong> In reality, there is only institutionalized “privilege” for victim-status groups. There is no privilege for whites, males, white males or straight white males. When confronted with such claims, demand to see proof of such privilege. Invariably, you will get a long list of first world problems and complaints backed by nothing but easily debunked talking points and misrepresented statistics. People should not feel guilty for being born the way they are, and this includes us “white male devils.”</p>
<p><strong>Demand facts to back claims:</strong> Cultural Marxists tend to argue on the basis of opinion rather than fact. Present facts to counter their claims, and demand facts and evidence in return. Opinions are irrelevant if the person is not willing to present supporting facts when asked.</p>
<p><strong>Do not play the game of “unconscious bias”:</strong> If social justice cultists can’t counter your position with facts or logic, they will invariably turn to the old standby that you are limited in your insight because you have not lived in the shoes of a – (insert victim group here).  I agree.  In fact, I would point out that this reality of limited perception also applies to THEM as well.  They have not lived in my shoes, therefore they are in no position to claim I enjoy “privilege” while they do not.  This is why facts and evidence are so important, and why anecdotal evidence and personal feelings are irrelevant where cultural Marxism is concerned.</p>
<p><strong>Let cultural Marxists know their fears and feelings do not matter: </strong>No one is entitled to have their feelings addressed by others. And, a person’s fears are ultimately unimportant. Whether the issue is the nonexistent “rape culture” or the contempt cultural Marxists feel over private gun ownership, their irrational fears are not our concern. Why should any individual relinquish his liberties in the name of placating frightened nobodies?</p>
<p><strong>Demand that society respect your inherent individual rights:</strong> Collectivism’s ultimate propaganda message is that there is no such thing as inherent rights or liberties and that all rights are arbitrary and subject to the whims of the group or the state. This is false. <a href="http://www.alt-market.com/articles/1437-are-individuals-the-property-of-the-collective" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.alt-market.com/articles/1437-are-individuals-the-property-of-the-collective', 'I have written extensively');">I have written extensively</a> in the past on inherent rights, inborn psychological contents and natural law, referencing diverse luminaries, scientists and thinkers, including Thomas Aquinas, Carl Gustave Jung, Steven Pinker, etc., and I welcome readers to study my many articles on individualism.  Freedom is an inborn conception with universally understood aspects. Period. No group or collective is more important than individual liberty. No artificial society has preeminence over the individuals within that society. As long as a person is not directly impeding the life, liberty, prosperity and privacy of another person, he should be left alone.</p>
<p><strong>Maintain your rights; they do not hurt other people:</strong> PC cultists will invariably argue that every person, whether he knows it or not, is indirectly harming others with his attitude, his beliefs, his refusal to associate, even his very breathing.  “We live in a society”, they say, “and everything we do affects everyone else…”.  Don’t take such accusations seriously; these people do not understand how freedom works.</p>
<p>Say, for instance, hypothetically, that I refuse to bake a gay wedding cake for a couple and I am accused of violating their rights in the name of preserving my own. I would immediately point out that no one is entitled to a gay wedding cake, baked by me or anyone else and I have every right to choose my associations based on whatever criteria I see fit. Now, a corrupt government entity may claim I do not have that right. But the fact is I do, and no one — not even government — can force me to bake a cake if I don’t want to. Also, I would point out that the gay couple in question has every right in a free society to bake their OWN damn cake or open their own cake shop to compete with mine. This is how freedom works. It is not based on collective entitlement; it is based on personal responsibility.</p>
<p><strong>Refuse to deny the scientific fact of biological gender:</strong> Gender is first and foremost a genetic imperative. Society does not determine gender roles; nature does. A man who chops up his body and takes hormone pills to look like a woman is not and will never be a woman. A woman who tapes down her breasts and gets a short haircut will never be a man. There is no such thing as “transgendered” people. No amount of social justice or wishful thinking will ever allow them to reverse their genetic proclivities. Their psychological and sexual leanings do not change their inborn biological reality.</p>
<p>By extension, we should refuse to play along with this nonsense. I will never refer to a man in a wig and dress as a “woman.” I will never refer to a woman with identity issues as “transgendered.” They are what nature made them, and we should not police our pronouns just to falsely reassure them that they can deny nature.</p>
<p><strong>Deny the illusion of Utopian equality: </strong> There is no such thing as pure equality.  Society is not a homogeneous entity, it is an abstraction built around a group of unique individuals.  Individuals can be naturally gifted, or naturally challenged.  But there will always be some people who are more apt towards success than others.</p>
<p>I have no problem whatsoever with the idea of equality of opportunity, which is exactly what we have in this country (except in the world of elitist finance which is purely driven by nepotism).  I do have a problem with the lie of universal equality through engineered means.</p>
<p>Standards of success should not be lowered in order to accommodate the least skilled people to facilitate artificial parity.  For example, I constantly hear the argument that more people with victim group status should be given greater representation in positions of influence and regard within our culture, from science and engineering, to media, to business CEO’s, to politics, etc.  The key word here is “given”, rather than “earned”.  There is nothing wrong with one group of people excelling in a field more than another group, and there is nothing wrong with inequality when it comes to individual achievement.  We must begin refusing to reward people for mediocrity and punishing success simply because the winners are not part of a designated victim group.</p>
<p><strong>If you are a man, embrace your role: </strong>I am a man and cannot claim to know what specific solutions women should take to counter cultural Marxism. I would love to read an article written on the subject by a woman in the Liberty Movement.  I will say that men in particular have a considerable task ahead in terms of their personal endeavors if they hope to repair the destruction of social justice.</p>
<p>For thousands of years, men have been the primary industrial force behind human progress. Today, they are relegated to cubicles and customer service, to video games and Web fantasies, to drug addictions and a lack of responsibility. If we have any chance of undoing the damage of cultural Marxism, modern men must take on their original roles as producers, inventors, entrepreneurs, protectors, builders and warriors once again. They should do this for their own benefit, and not for the validation of others.</p>
<p>You don’t have to prove to anyone you do “manly things”, just go out and do them. Most importantly, become dangerous. Men are meant to be dangerous beings. That does not mean we are meant to be indiscriminately violent (just as women aren’t meant to be indiscriminately violent), but we are supposed to be threatening to those who would threaten us. Modern society has NOT removed the need for masculinity and I believe people will begin realizing this the more our culture sinks into economic despair. Train in martial arts, learn tactical firearms handling, go hunting and don’t take lip from people. In my opinion, every man should know how to kill things, even if he never plans on using those abilities.</p>
<p><strong>Home-school your children:</strong> It’s simple, if you don’t want your kids propagandized, if you truly want them to be free from collectivist conditioning, then you will make the sacrifice and extract them from public schooling. With the introduction of Common Core into U.S. schools in particular, there is no other recourse but home schooling to prevent the brainwashing of cultural Marxism. If you do not do this, you are relying on the hope that your children will escape with their critical thinking abilities intact. Some do, and some don’t. Others turn into mindless social justice zombies. You can give them an advantage by removing them from a poisonous environment, and that is what matters.</p>
<p>The insane lie that cultural Marxists seem to have conned themselves and others into believing is that their “activism” is somehow anti-establishment. In fact, social justice is constantly coddled and supported by the establishment. From politicians to judges to media pundits to the blogosphere, the overwhelming majority of people in positions of traditional power (even in supposedly conservative circles) have been more than happy to become the enforcers of the social justice warrior agenda, an agenda representing a minuscule portion of the public. There is no establishment for the PC army to fight; the establishment bias works vastly more in favor of their ideology than any other. Cultural Marxists ARE the establishment.</p>

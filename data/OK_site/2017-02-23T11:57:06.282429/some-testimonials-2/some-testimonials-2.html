<p><strong>Wooly:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Testimonial: I joined Oath Keepers because of what this Organization stands for. I spent 3 years in Germany during the Cold War and did have an opportunity go on 3 border deployments. I have seen what extremes a government would go through to suppress its people from Freedom. I’m seeing our freedoms and Constitution, as defined, eroded.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I just want that opportunity to keep those freedoms.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>SBR Dirk:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Testimonial: As an Oath Keeper, I pledge to protect this country and its Constitution as our Forefathers fought so hard to provide us. Its not necessarily a will or eagerness to fight, but given the provocation I am more than ready. America will not be a tyrannical power under my watch. If three percent could do it back in the 1700’s then three percent can do it again if need be. I will not sit back only to watch my rights, as an American, be purposefully eroded out from under me. The time has come for the people to take a stand!</p>
<p>Sincerely, a fellow 3 Percenter,<br/>
SBR Dirk</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>David R. McConnaughey:</strong></p>
<p>Testimonial:  Declaration of Orders I Will NOT Obey</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Recognizing that we each swore an oath to support and defend the Constitution against all enemies, foreign and domestic, and affirming that we are guardians of the Republic, of the principles in our Declaration of Independence, and of the rights of our people, we affirm and declare the following:</p>
<p>1. I will NOT obey any order to disarm the American people.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The attempt to disarm the people on April 19, 1775 was the spark of open conflict in the American Revolution. That vile attempt was an act of war, and the American people fought back in justified, righteous self-defense of their natural rights. Any such order today would also be an act of war against the American people, and thus an act of treason. I will not make war on our own people, and we will not commit treason by obeying any such treasonous order.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Nor will I assist, or support any such attempt to disarm the people by other<br/>
government entities, either state or federal.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In addition, I affirm that the purpose of the Second Amendment is to preserve the military power of the people so that they will, in the last resort, have effective final recourse to arms and to the God of Hosts in the face of tyranny.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">2. I will NOT obey any order to conduct warrantless searches of the American people, their homes, vehicles, papers, or effects — such as warrantless house-to house searches for weapons or persons.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">3. I will NOT obey any order to detain American citizens as “unlawful enemy combatants” or to subject them to trial by military tribunal.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The international laws of war do not trump our Bill of Rights. I reject as illegitimate any such claimed power, as did the Supreme Court in Ex Parte Milligan (1865). Any attempt to apply the laws of war to American civilians, under any pretext, such as against domestic “militia” groups the government brands “domestic terrorists,” is an act of war and an act of treason.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">4. I will NOT obey orders to impose martial law or a “state of emergency” on a<br/>
state, or to enter with force into a state, without the express consent and invitation of that state’s legislature and governor.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The imposition of martial law by the national government over a state and its people, treating them as an occupied enemy nation, is an act of war. Such an attempted suspension of the Constitution and Bill of Rights voids the compact with the states and with the people.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">5. I will NOT obey orders to invade and subjugate any state that asserts its sovereignty and declares the national government to be in violation of the compact by which that state entered the Union.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Chief among those principles is that ours is a dual sovereignty system, with the people of each state retaining all powers not granted to the national government they created, and thus the people of each state reserved to themselves the right to judge when the national government they created has voided the compact between the states by asserting powers never granted.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Upon the declaration by a state that such a breach has occurred, I will not obey orders to force that state to submit to the national government.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">6. I will NOT obey any order to blockade American cities, thus turning them into giant concentration camps.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Such tactics were repeated by the Nazis in the Warsaw Ghetto, and by the Imperial Japanese in Nanking, turning entire cities into death camps. Any such order to disarm and confine the people of an American city will be an act of war and thus an act of treason.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">7. I will NOT obey any order to force American citizens into any form of detention camps under any pretext.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Such a vile order to forcibly intern Americans without charges or trial would be an act of war against the American people, and thus an act of treason, regardless of the pretext used. I will not commit treason, nor will I facilitate or support it.”NOT on Our Watch!”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">8. I will NOT obey orders to assist or support the use of any foreign troops on U.S. soil against the American people to “keep the peace” or to “maintain control” during any emergency, or under any other pretext. We will consider such use of foreign troops against our people to be an invasion and an act of war.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Accordingly, as the militia of the several states are the only military force contemplated by the Constitution, in Article I, Section 8, for domestic keeping of the peace, and as the use of even our own standing army for such purposes is without such constitutional support, the use of foreign troops and mercenaries against the people is wildly unconstitutional, egregious, and an act of war.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I will oppose such troops as enemies of the people and we will treat all who request, invite, and aid those foreign troops as the traitors they are.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">9. We will NOT obey any orders to confiscate the property of the American people, including food and other essential supplies, under any emergency pretext whatsoever.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Accordingly, I will not obey or facilitate orders to confiscate food and other essential supplies from the people, and we will consider all those who issue or carry out such orders to be the enemies of the people.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">10. I will NOT obey any orders which infringe on the right of the people to free speech, to peaceably assemble, and to petition their government for a redress of grievances.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Rick Norris:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Testimonial: My family first came to this country in 1810, and has been involved in every one of its wars since 1812. So, it came natural to me to raise my right hand and follow suit in 1971 as I joined the Army when a lot of men were avoiding doing so.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To me, my oath means keeping the responsibility of the gift of citizenship that I was so blessed to be born with. As a born-again Christian, it is unbreakable because it is sworn before almighty God. And as such, it cannot and does not have an expiration date.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Paul Palmatier:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Testimonial: My Oath was in August of 1973. I was 20 years old and signed up for the 4th Infantry Division. The Viet Nam war was still going on and I had my ideas of what made this country great. People stepping up and being a part of something they believe in. I ended up teaching convoy control and defense at Fort Carson, Colorado. Later became an MP with the 4th MP Company.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">From 1980 to 1984 I was at the VA Medical Center in Albany NY. Worked in the VA Police Force there. Figured out that Law Enforcement was not for me and went with Transportation again.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I will defend my Country against its Government if need be.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>SGT Jacob Ratliff:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Testimonial: I am a Purple Heart recipient, Army veteran of both Iraq and Afghanistan. I took ‘THE OATH’ after my birthday (Sept. 11th). At the time, it had not yet revealed itself to me as one of the most important things that I would ever do. After a few deployments to both war zones as a 60 gunner, I began to realize what that oath really means…Here it is in MY heart…For the ones that can’t stand anymore, STAND UP! For the ones that can’t yet stand, STAND UP! For the ones that stood side by side and no longer stand, STAND UP!! For the ones that need a swift kick…STAND UP!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I have watched the defenders of this country stand up and give everything against the evils of the world. It is time for those same great men to stand once again, against the evils festering in our own nation! My heart is bleeding and crying out for YOU to stand with me and yell to the heavens that we will not let them tear down the foundation of our beloved country! We WILL STAND UP and defend her with the same passion and wrath that has made us who we are! We have been willing to give our last breath in another man’s country…now, we have to use those breathes that God has graced us with since then to hold on to what so many have died for…HERE! I am forever in service to our Holy Father who has given me the skills and courage to honor my oath…and I WILL honor it with my life and if need be my death. In uniform or out of it, I will do everything in my power to uphold my oath to the CONSTITUTION, not the administration. Remember that our human tragedy has been for good men to stand by and do nothing in the face of evil.<br/>
GOD BLESS AMERICA!<br/>

## Alex Jones; Rob Dew; Aaron Dykes

AJ: I want to go to Rob Dew and Aaron Dykes, who we sent up to Massachusetts. They were in Lexington, where 234 years ago, in 1775, the Revolutionary War started when the Red Coats came to confiscate the guns. The media will tell you the Red Coats didn’t exist, it wasn’t about guns, it didn’t happen. It was actually a big university professor who said it wasn’t about gun confiscation and that the colonies were anti-gun. We exposed him, he got, he lost his tenure. We’re entering a new world now where there’s no EU but there is an EU. There’s no Lexington and Concord but there is. Where Obama’s cutting the budget by half when he spent more than all presidents before him combined. We’re entering a new vortex of disinfo. But you guys were there, I want to commend you for going. You said it was a great event. Tell folks about the Oath Keepers and the Committees of Safety, on the anniversary, on the Green, having all these police and military swear an oath to protect and defend the Constitution and not follow the New World Order.

RD: (0:01:13.3) It was an amazing event. Thanks to the Oath Keepers and the Committees of Safety for making us feel welcome, giving us their time, we got a lot of good interviews, before during and after the event. We watched the reenactment that morning, we took some cameras out there. It was all about guns. They said put down your weapons and walk away and the guy jumps out of the crowd and says you’re not getting my gun. That’s what it was about. They wanted their guns. They stood up. Watching that battle, the guys were really into it.
 AJ: For those that don’t know, recap the basics and give us a report.

RD: OK is an organization that got together with Committees of Safety for this event. They wanted to bring people who had already taken the oath to reaffirm the oath. They’re not looking for oath takers, they’re looking for oath keepers. Stewart Rhodes and Walter Reddy had a great cast of guys. It was a 3 hour event. A guy read Edwin Vieira’s speech about what took place that day. They had a naval officers, army, special forces guys, all get up and talk about what it meant for them to take the oath. Then SR and the retired policeman got up and read the 10 orders they will not obey.

AD: Dave Freeman

AJ: Was Sheriff Mack there?

RD: He was. He had a good speech. He stopped in the middle, he said I want everybody to get together because everybody was spread out. He said we need to see the numbers. One thing that was interesting, there was not one mainstream media person present, but a lot of citizen media.

AJ: Oh, they’re scared to death of police and military saying they’ll uphold the Bill of Rights and Constitution, their oath. Because according to federal report, that’s all terrorism. Owning guns, buying ammo, being a veteran, you’re the number one threat. They keep telling you it’s about al-Qaeda, it’s really all designed for you. People that won’t let foreign banks conquer us, we’ve been conquered, through fraud. They need our acquiescence to their fraud to continue it and expand it.

RD: (0:03:31.9) I don’t even know if you heard about this. The day before yesterday they found an ex-Marine, he was trying to bring a gun and some ammo and a grenade fuse onto a plane. He actually got on the plane and they checked him in Boston, they checked his bags again and found all this stuff. Interesting that it didn’t get caught through the scanner. They stopped AD coming back and wanted to search his bags because of his al-Qaeda like camera, right?

AD: Yeah. That would be right. It’s always a camera. What are you filming for? People who can’t even speak English anymore.

AJ: They asked you at the airport?

AD: Yeah.

AJ: Why you film? [terrible stereotype of Asian accent] No, that’s what it’s come to. I one time saw a WW2 vet, probably dead now, it was 5-6 years ago, in San Francisco. He’s getting on a place to go to Hawaii to the WW2 memorial, he’d been in the battle. He literally, they had the security wearing bright blue commando outfits and these black berets. He had an oxygen bottle, they were jabbing him going [more Asian noises]. That’s who they’re going to use. I’ve got the FEMA drill with foreign troops coming up. National level exercise 2009. I guess that’s the new patriotism. You had foreigners like [weird noises]

AD: (0:04:52.3) Alex, they pulled me over for a camera and the woman next to me was being extra searched for a knitting kit. A crocheting kit.

AJ: It’s about training us, we’re the enemy. It’s the good law abiding slaves must be taught. They’re importing people from third world police states who are used to this and who enjoy bossing the American people around.

AJ: (0:05:15.6) Okay guys, you had a lot of fun. Clear COINTEL Pro was there, I don’t want to get into that too much though. Just classic behavior by these people. Finish up the report about evil Americans saying they’ll follow the Bill of Rights, Constitution.

AD: There were about 350 people. There.

RD: I think it may have been as many as 500.

AJ: The main Paul Revere event had about 5k.

RD: The main event the next morning, yeah. And they did put a little speech in there about 9/11, before how we were attacked on that day.

AD: That was the last time we had a call to action, attack on our country.

AJ: That’s why we’ve set up a police state for all you patriots here today. It’s all for you. But turn in your guns or al-Qaeda will get you. I’m fighting al-Qaeda. al-Qaeda is a white guy or black guy owning a firearm. Go ahead.

RD: OK had a great ceremony. Capt. Larry Bailey, who’s an ex-Navy Seal, he administered the oath. I actually took the oath with a lot of other people who were non-military. They were allowing them, too. It was pretty serious, pretty solemn. A lot of good speeches. I’m there, Alex, I’m in.

AJ: You’re with al-Qaeda now. 

RD: OK wanted to give you a shirt, they sent one for you here. Here you go. 

AJ: You said a lot of supporters of the show. There was a rumor I was going to be there.

AD: Not only did they ask and demand that Alex Jones show up, they started rumors that AJ was here, I saw him over there. Really? Is he coming? No folks, he’s not coming. He sends his support, he has to do the show.

RD: We also had a great interview with the guy who wrote the 29 Palms survey.

AJ: Well done.

RD: Here’s an autographed copy for you.

AJ: Excellent. That’s the Marine, he knew they were doing these questionnaires, so he thought he would do one and make it public. That was how he got it out. This is all for the new Obama film. I want to make an announcement about the new Obama film right now. I could release it July 4 and make it still good and powerful. But I want to do other interviews. I was going to make it probably not as powerful as Obama Deception, but just all the latest info. I thought no, let me make it more powerful. So it’s going to come out September 1. It will be done by the end of July. We’re shifting into a chemtrail film we’re making after that. We’ve gotta race, it’s only a month and a half more, we’ve got more time for a few more interviews. Anything else that happened while you were there? 

AD: (0:08:01.9) It really is refreshing to see active duty military, police standing up for the Constitution.

AJ: Number one threat in here.

AD: No I will not confiscate guns. No I will not conduct illegal searches under the 4th Amendment.

RD: I will not put people in FEMA camps.

AD: Knowing this stuff is going on routinely.

AJ: But the camps are for our safety, Glenn Beck says.

RD: We also met the masked Marine, the young guy who is still a Marine. He took the oath, he’s going to be a liaison.

AJ: Did you say the masked?

RD: The masked Marine. He did a few YouTube videos. His guys, they basically study the Constitution, all his Marine buddies. 

AJ: The al-Qaeda-tution. No really, they’ve built this grid for fighting al-Qaeda, now they’re going by the way the whole thing is for you the American people. You are al-Qaeda.

RD: Right. These guys know that. They know they’re going to be targeted. So they uphold themselves with a lot of dignity and respect.

AJ: Good. They have pledged their lives, their treasure, their sacred honor, their blood, on the tree of liberty. And we will be victorious.

RD: We were on that field where the blood was spilled.

AJ: Come back, I want to hear about that. Look at you, a little gleam in your eyes. You are fulfilling your destiny. We’ll be right back.

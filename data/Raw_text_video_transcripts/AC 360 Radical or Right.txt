## It’s a clip from AC 360 on the anniversary of OKC bombing. Interviews with Katherine Bleich, Stewart Rhodes
## Correspondent is Drew Griffin. John Avlon comes in at 6 minutes

AC: Commemoration comes at a time when Americans are angry at the fed government. Pro-2A demonstrations in Washington today. While it’s okay for Americans to be upset with government, some fringe groups have become alarming to Washington. Are they a real threat?

## Clip from DG

DG: 9/11, government conspiracy?

Katherine Bleich [no idea how to spell name]: I don’t know, but everyone should question it.

DG: Obama, born in US?

KB: I don’t know, but everyone should question it.

##KB interviewed in Brave New Books. KB described as leader of Liberty Restoration Project

DG: Are you anti-govt?

KB: No. I’m anti-coercion and anti-force. Gov’t should be consensual.

DG voiceover: KB thinks we’re unfairly taxed, being spied upon, controlled by govt that looks like “other governments.” KB is not a militant, not violent. She’s a Tea Partier, a patriot, sees nothing wrong with “gun-toting militias” (0:02:25.9)

KB: It makes me feel safer. Who is violent right now? Is it people “advocating individual gun ownership” or the government? (0:02:40.1) It’s our government.

DG voiceover: SR anxious, too. Started OK, 8000 strong now. Their mission is controversial, many say a recipe for anarchy. SR believes it’s necessary.

SR: They don’t get sufficient training on Bill of Rights: 2A, search warrants, citizen detention.

DG voiceover: Bob Schulz, upstate NY. Been preaching anti-govt rhetoric for 30 years. Gotten in trouble trying to convince people they don’t need to pay taxes. New movement is “liberating return to freedom” rather than a threat.

BS: Thrilling to see so many people talking about the Constitution.

DG voiceover: All three share views that are not mainstream. But Bleich says conspiracy theories aren’t so wacky if you research them.

DG: Is govt preparing FEMA camps.

KB: Yes. HR645.

DG: To intern US citizens?

KB: I don’t know. I hope not. (0:04:07.2)

DG voiceover: Theory that government preparing political internment camps growing in popularity, because of documentary Camp FEMA. HR 645 is stalled, called for 6 FEMA camps to be prepared to hold large groups of Americans.

SR: Is it possible? Sure. We interned Japanese Americans in WW2.

DG voiceover: What concerns them all is political left that labels them extremists, potential terrorists, even racists. Willing media goes along with those labels. Also the SPLC, which the patriot groups say unfairly links them to racists. SPLC says tea parties cannot be considered extremist groups but contain radical ideas, conspiracy theories, and racism.

KB: Not true.

DG voiceover: KB says real danger is current political climate, polarizing all Americans. Politics as usual, dividing us all.

KB: (0:05:46.4) We’re all concerned about this country. We need to start working together, stop labeling and dividing.

AC: John Avlon from Daily Beast joins. How were the groups rallying today in VA and DC different from Tea Party groups?

JA: These are 2A activists, rather than tax activists. Both come from same broad anxiety. Demonstration on national park land today by 2A was only possible because of a bill signed by Obama. “Phantom menace” leading people to believe the worst about the government, “being fed a steady diet of fear and hate in politics, and it has a trickle-down effect, as we saw 15 years ago” (0:07:07.7).

AC: Some see protests on April 19, anniversary of OKC bombing, as offensive. Was this tied to OKC bombing? There are other events on this day.

JA: No. April 19 has “talismanic importance,” even before OKC bombing. (0:07:31.8) 235 anniversary of Lexington and Concord. History, though: Waco, inspiration of OKC, and a long series of events. Larger themes of resistance and vulnerability. We have an obligation to learn from history. The last time we saw a massive increase in militia movement, “it did not end well” (0:08:03.3).

AC: They say it’s because it’s Patriot’s Day.

JA: That’s right. They wrap themselves up in the flag, as true defenders of the American revolution. Problem that it asserts that other people are lesser patriots. Return of paranoid style in American politics only divides us, pumping up hate and fear, conspiracy entrepreneurs trying to make money off these people (0:08:49.6).

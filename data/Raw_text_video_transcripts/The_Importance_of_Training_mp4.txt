Jason Van Tatenhove: [00:00:12] OK folks we are here with Todd in the the northern Idaho training facility here we just got done doing an incredible course with John Moseby. Todd, can you tell us a little bit about what you have going on here in northern Idaho and the types of training you're doing here. 

Todd: [00:00:29] Well what we what we do is we just host trainers from all over the west primarily but some of them are from the Midwest and East. They'll come all the way out here and give us advanced training over and above what we can attain here in the area. and the local community benefits from it because us a small group we have 15 guys here right now. Can then take that back into their local communities and share it with their churches and they can share it with actually police departments. they don't know a lot of the stuff that we do. I have a lot of friends that are a lot of officers and when I discuss some of the training that we undertake, they look at me like I have three heads. So then all of a sudden they're out there on the square range with us, out here in the mountains doing some long range training, or fighting gear pistol in a real world scenario instead of just shooting at a target down at the range. We actually have simguns or plastic guns and somebody's attacking. You've got to get to it, fight to it and actually win the fight before you can get your gun and that's just one of the examples. 

Jason Van Tatenhove: [00:02:02] Now do you think having people that are active law enforcement helps to change some of the perception we're having in the the Liberty or what would be called the militia community. 

Todd: [00:02:15] It does. Absolutely. It's a case by case basis. Some of my friends here they're really really interested in it and would like to actively participate in this. Other friends who are LEOs. They are a little bit put off by it, that We're getting advanced training from Special Forces guys, intelligence officers, random random trainers. But for the most part in our local area here, two local sheriffs in these counties they're completely fine with it. They actually find a comforting to know that they have citizens and former military that they can call in case there was ever something they were unable to deal with. 

Jason Van Tatenhove: [00:03:26] Sure they become a force multiplier you know that that sheriff's posse you know be able to really help out the community there. Tell us about some of the classes you've had here. 

Todd: [00:03:36] Just last year and a half, we have had a patrolling class which was four days, with John. which was absolutely amazing. Learning how to move through areas, hostile areas. 

Jason Van Tatenhove: [00:03:58] John Moseby of mountain gorilla. 

Todd: [00:04:00] Correct. OK. After that we had him come back for a pistol combatives, once again hand to hand Fighting to your handgun. You carry a concealed weapon. It's a lot more than just pull your gun out and shooting somebody. It's what if he's tackled you before you got the gun. now you've got the gun but you can't get to it. You end up on your back. Where is the placement of your gun are you carrying appendix car-, a hip holster, carrying appendix, on your back Really you can get to go It's stuck on your on your back. But if you're on your back get to it here by kicking him off and engaging. Then we brought in Sam Culper to do. 

Jason Van Tatenhove: [00:04:53] Sam Culper of forward observer. 

Todd: [00:04:54] Forward Observer correct. And we did a intelligence gathering class for the community intelligence preparation. Of the battle space or community. You mean that was absolutely amazing. And that was just all classroom study was just Such an eye opener. Doing threat analysis of your uh even of your area of operation or the local area where you lived and plan on bugging out. who are Your neighbors, who's the community. What's your sheriff's attitude toward you. A whole bunch of great information from the class. And right now currently we're finishing up another Patrolling class but it's. Usually a different area. So we're ultimately going with this is. If you take like Sam Culper's class. You gather the information on the say if you live in Seattle, well you find out that's going to be on the matter of something really, a tsunami happen, earthquake happen So. Then you. Figure out that you're gonna need to go somewhere else. So at that point the training that we're having here. 

Jason Van Tatenhove: [00:06:30] Keep flashing the logo. I will zoom out of it. 

Todd: [00:06:34] So the training that we're having up here with we're culminating towards Doing a threat analysis, figuring out that you're going to have to leave. At that point. You have to get into vehicles with your friends or family in a convoy and move out of the area. So. We're going to be getting more vehicle patrolling classes tells you how to react to contact. In a hostile environment if you're in a soft skin vehicle. And. At that point. At that point. You would then move to an area, get to your location, before you would ever go to your bug-out location let's just say, your secure facility. You would then get out Half a mile away, patrol up to your b- to your location. You need to know how to run in vehicles in a hostile environment. You're not going to just drive up to your house because somebody else could already have it and that you patrol up to it. If somebody else has inhabited it, you're going to need to get them out of there. So how do you do that. If they become entrenched in your location. What you learn CQB training. So you now the ability. 

Jason Van Tatenhove: [00:08:00] CQB for those who may not know what that is. 

Todd: [00:08:02] Close Quarter Battle. So you'll move through the house and get rid of those Interlopers shall we say. So what we're doing is putting it all together. So. 

Jason Van Tatenhove: [00:08:13] These classes are cumulative you know. 

Todd: [00:08:14] They are cumulative they are they, one is the one builds upon the other. So. For us it would be you know if one of our neighbors got in trouble, in a Katrina type situation. we would then mobilize our forces do it quick. What we've learned here is How to Put actions on an objective. So we would do a quick warning order an op order to figure out what we're doing and have a plan. We come off the mountain. In vehicles. So there where This class gives you the ability to. Ascertain what you're getting yourself into. And how to handle it when you get on the objective. 

Jason Van Tatenhove: [00:09:01] Now this class being the. Advanced. 

Todd: [00:09:06] Advanced patrolling but it's the planning stage of a patrol. You wouldn't just walk out of here and start patrolling without letting out, finding out where you're going, how you're going to get to get there, what you're going to do when you get there. Doing it and then getting back here. So it's a it's a planning phase so that your loved ones you would know What you're doing, where you're doing, doing it. And when you're going to be back. So you put together the plan, then we would move out in vehicles. that's where a vehicle patrolling task comes in, how to react to contact with your vehicles. Then we would go down to our neighbor in distress. And. Get communications with them. We practice a lot of communications. Set up a mile or a half mile out. patrol into his facility. If there's bad guys on the location, We then come in with CQB and we take care of that. And then we patrol out and then get our vehicles and come home. These are all skills that You cannot just find on YouTube or blogs. You have to pay somebody who has done this. I mean currently there There's gentlemen available, John Moseby being one of them, that's willing teach you how to move through hostile areas. In a Katrina type situation or say a Ferguson type situation, You got caught in your or Rodney King riots situation. Reginald Denny should have done things different obviously because His fate there that day was not not the best, not the most beneficial. 

Jason Van Tatenhove: [00:11:00] So tell us about what classes you have coming up. How can people get more information. And does someone have to be you know all trained out to do this, do you have to be all geared out to do this. 

Todd: [00:11:11] Absolutely not. Well we'll add some more information on our contact information and at the end of the video. But what we recommend for people and this applies to probably most Families or guys with guns. We all have a lot of guns. But we have very very little training and I was definitely guilty of this a few years ago. And I would say why don't have $500 for a four day course. Well I've come to the conclusion that, sell one of my guns, Take a five day, four or five day course. It's way better to have the skills Than it is to have the hardware. It's better to have the software Than it is to have the hardware. There's guns everywhere. But there isn't Special Operations Forces guys come to your location to train you. And once you have that, The skills the software, it can't be taken from you. Guns are, They're tangible items, they can be stolen. They break down. But the skills you learn with them do not. Be. The culmination of the training that we've been going through is finalized, I would be able to walk Or drive anywhere without a gun. And if I got to my friend's house and they had them, I have the skills now to train up all of my friends. If I had no training and I showed up at my friend's house with a lot of guns. Now all of us have a lot of guns. We really don't know how to deploy them. And really protect your family, In a earthquake, tsunami, economic disaster. So. This training is much more important than going to buy the newest Greatest trinket, glock, Whatever. Training is much more important. In Comparison, anybody, a 10 year old can have friends go buy a car but they don't know how to drive it. So. They need to learn how to drive it. You could teach a 10 year old to drive a car. And teach Anybody in your family. we've had 16 year old kids in our classes. 18 year old kids, women. And when they are done with Three or four or five day class. They're absolutely shocked 

Jason Van Tatenhove: [00:13:59] And age ranges just too I mean just this class alone we had a very dynamic age range all the way up. We have different physical fitness levels. I mean there are guys that may have some some medical issues but yet they're out here doing it you know they're getting those skills so you don't have to think that you've got to be this Rambo type guy to be out here doing this this is anyone this is you know. 

Todd: [00:14:19] John he is an incredible teacher in that he can Evaluate who's on location for the training. It's not he's not drill sergeant he's not, You know, making you run five miles with a rucksack on. You can if you want to test your skills. But. Yeah we have we've had kids 16 years old all the way and here we had a 58 year old in the Class. And he just absolutely loving it. 

Jason Van Tatenhove: [00:14:51] Now you got all kinds of different people too. You've got a pharmacist here we've got a you know former law enforcement you've got me, an alternative journalist. you just got on this whole group of people that is a very dynamic range. 

Todd: [00:15:03] We've got preachers Here. 

Jason Van Tatenhove: [00:15:04] Yeah We have a preacher. 

Todd: [00:15:06] We've had a lot of preachers. And once again come out and get the training and then take it back to your family, to your friends, to your congregation, to your local law enforcement officers who are really when you talk to them about this stuff. They they give you the thousand yard stare, they really don't understand what you're saying. And a case in point is a friend of mine is on a SWAT team. I said if you were ever to go into breach a door if you were to receive fire from across the street neighbor What would your reaction be like. He looked at me like. We would be in trouble. We would have no response to that because we don't train in how to break contact In a gunfight. We only trained in one specific area and it's CQB. How to knock doors and go clear houses. So he was really interested in learning more about this. 

Jason Van Tatenhove: [00:16:06] Awesome. Sounds like you've got an incredible program up here. We're going to definitely be coming back. You know and we'll figure out a way to let our viewers and listeners know you know what sort of classes you have going on and when and how they can get more information. So thanks for putting us on. I really had a great time and I appreciate what you doing. 

Todd: [00:16:23] It's a lot of fun. You know it's a lot of fun. Thank you

<content:encoded>I am well aware of why the feds did why they did, but I’m having a hard time justifying US BEING TO LEGALLY USE “TANNERITE” (or other explosive stuff) for ANY LEGAL PURPOSE.  The bottom line is that when you are mixing up Tannerite, you ARE MAKING A BOMB (very lethal one).  That’s legal but making a pipe-bomb filled with black powder or ‘nasty-chemicals’ is not okay?  Duhhh …what’s wrong with that analogy?

<content:encoded>Well said! And, there are a lot of other young people just like you. That and Donald Trump are what still gives me hope for the nation.

<content:encoded>Chris Campbell, the guy that was “converting dummy grenades into live grenades” done my back tattoo, and was a good friend, he was a hardcore patriot, and a US marine just trying to keep his oath

<content:encoded>I’m 19 years old and I can go ahead and set you straight real quick! I’m not a sheep, I couldn’t care less about trending things, Twitter or Facebook. I’m a pissed off American. I’m tired of people being labeled as a racist for standing up and saying that all lives matter and then they get bashed saying that they’re racist. I’m tired of all the political correctness going on. No politician has any backbone, no one wants to stand up for what’s right anymore. Some politicians do but they’re scare of being labeled a racist or something else. I’m tired of the crap going on in our country. I’m more than ready to defend our rights and fight back for our country from these loony leftists and race baiting scum.

<content:encoded>yes it is possible some of it is pure B.S. hell this day and age with the advent of technology, the ability to throw out conflicting information to hide the truth is now easier then ever, for all any of us know, this whole story could be a big B.S. Propaganda Psy-op against the American public, and if the FBI or CIA are in on it, the fabrication of court documents would be easy to convince the public it is real. 
<p>it is sad that we must question literally EVERYTHING that government is involved in due to the scope of intertwined involvement, from “authoritative legal documents” to pretty much anything else now. </p>
<p>after all propaganda worked WONDERS for Russia with T.V. and radio, and our own CIA took a look at the playbook and used it here in the homeland.</p>

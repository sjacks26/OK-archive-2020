<p style="text-align: justify;">This article poses some questions that every American should ask, and demand to be answered, concerning the Jade Helm 15 military exercise planned to run from July to Sept. in six States. What is the military up to? If this is training, what are they really training for? Nothing about Jade Helm 15, in my opinion, looks good.  –  Shorty Dawkins, Associate Editor</p>

<p>by Scott Creighton</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The other day I was <a href="https://willyloman.wordpress.com/2015/03/24/what-is-jade-helm-15-and-should-we-be-worried/" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'https://willyloman.wordpress.com/2015/03/24/what-is-jade-helm-15-and-should-we-be-worried/', 'wondering aloud');" target="_blank">wondering aloud</a> if we should be worried about the upcoming Jade Helm 15 Special Ops training operation scheduled to take place very soon in  California, Nevada, Arizona, New Mexico, Utah, Colorado and yes, glorious Texas.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I concluded that we should be worried because it seemed to me that the operation was going to be very different from regular training exercises in that it was going to be extremely covert with Special Ops guys infiltrating communities looking to them to rat out the undesirables and forming groups who could be trusted to help them round those people up and get rid of them.</p>
<p>You know, basically what Special Ops does in other countries routinely.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Well, today there is an article from the Houston Chronicle which gives ample support to some of my worst fears.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“Among the planned exercises, soldiers will try to operate undetected amongst civilian populations in some towns and cities where residents will be advised to report any suspicious activity they notice as a means of testing the military’s effectiveness, said county law enforcement officials who had been briefed by the Army.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“They’re going to set up cells of people and test how well they’re able to move around without getting too noticed in the community,” said Roy Boyd, chief deputy with the Victoria County Sheriff’s Office. “They’re testing their abilities to basically blend in with the local environment and not stand out and blow their cover.” <a href="http://www.chron.com/news/article/Covert-warfare-comming-to-Texas-6157685.php#photo-7713764" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.chron.com/news/article/Covert-warfare-comming-to-Texas-6157685.php#photo-7713764', 'Chron.com');" target="_blank">Chron.com</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Without exposing themselves as part of the drill, how are civilians supposed to know who or what to report as “suspicious”? Will they be reporting on Special Ops participants in the drill or other residents of the locations where the op is taking place?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And what will the Special Ops participants do with that information?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Here’s another question… those “cells of people” they talk about setting up – what are they? Are they cells of Special Ops participants trying to see if they are noticed or… are they groups of locals they set up like so many they have set up in the past in other countries and is the point to see if THOSE groups are going to be noticed traveling around doing whatever it is they get them to do?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Either way, this operation is deeply troubling because the whole point of it is too “operate undetected amongst civilian populations”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It’s one thing to have black helicopter gunships cruising at tree-top level overhead scaring the shit out of the local population. That’s pretty bad when they run drills that do that or practice imposing martial law on some unsuspecting community somewhere.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">But when the military (specifically a branch of it with a history of supporting terrorism, sabotage and subversion in the interests of protecting corporate profits overseas) announces it’s plan to INFILTRATE with SUBTERFUGE a number of U.S. states and then operate cells in secret looking to identify and subdue troublemakers, you have to worry about that and wonder if it is even legal.</p>

<content:encoded>I am glad this article is posted. I’ve spent over 40 years trying to educate idiots on the ills of big pharma, the insurance fraud and those doctors who willing participate in creating patients rather than healing patients. There is great gains in some fields of medicine, however this article points out the ills of big pharma greed. They have without any sense of conscience destroyed the life of millions who faithfully listened to the quacks that bought into the fraud…or should I say were bought to push the fraud.

<content:encoded>James you have GOTTA edit down your text!!!!!!  You repeat yourself way too often.  Please work on it then resubmit, it’ll be worth it.  BTW, I’ve long ago noticed a pattern of folks being put on what I call (from personal experience) Zombie-Juice drugs then going off the cold turkey and then going violent, even long-term (e.g. Ted Kaczynski).

<content:encoded>@flinter-“It will be a sad day when they realize too late that they were warned about what is happening to them. not sure if I will laugh or cry…Time will tell.”
<p>You should start laughing as of now for laughter makes for a healthy body and a joyous soul <img alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" src="https://www.oathkeepers.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;"/> Let those that are blinded by arrogance, malice and plain stupidity do the crying.</p>

<content:encoded>I tell the idiots at work about this stuff all the time. They get all quiet like little brats who just got bagged with their hand in the cookie jar. Then they look at me like I have two heads and go back to talking about far more important subjects such as the latest smart phone or the deflategate scandal with that dumbass jock strap Tom Brady.<br/>
It will be a sad day when they realize too late that they were warned about what is happening to them. not sure if I will laugh or cry…Time will tell.

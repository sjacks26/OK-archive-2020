<p>This restaurant has certainly put their employees and patrons at risk. Gee, do you think the criminals can’t read? Or don’t notice the signs telling them they have a free pass to rob unarmed businesses and folks? No clue. – Shorty Dawkins, Associate Editor</p>

<p>Even while Michael Bloomberg’s anti-gun groups celebrate their “victory” in getting Chipotle to ban guns from their stores, a story out of Durham, NC reminds us why these so called “gun free zones” are actually doing more harm than good.</p>
<p>At 9pm on Sunday night the “The Pit Authentic Barbecue” in Durham was robbed at gunpoint when 3 masked men entered the restaurant through the back door.</p>
<p>From <a href="http://abc11.com/news/durham-police-investigate-armed-robbery-at-restaurant/66643/" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://abc11.com/news/durham-police-investigate-armed-robbery-at-restaurant/66643/', 'abc11.com');" target="_blank">abc11.com</a>,</p>
<p>DURHAM, N.C. (WTVD) –Police are searching for three suspects involved in an armed robbery at Durham’s newly-opened barbecue restaurant, The Pit, at 321 W. Geer Street.</p>
<p>Authorities said just before 9 p.m. Sunday, three men wearing hoodies entered the restaurant through the back doors with pistols, and forced several staff members to lie on the floor.</p>
<p>The bandits assaulted two employees during the crime, but they were not seriously injured.</p>
<p>Thankfully, no one was seriously hurt or injured in this incident, but it’s no thanks to a sign on the window of the restaurant that clearly states <a href="http://www.ncgunblog.com/2014/05/19/guns-allowed-means-easy-targets/" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.ncgunblog.com/2014/05/19/guns-allowed-means-easy-targets/', 'no guns are allowed');" target="_blank">no guns are allowed</a>.</p>
<p><img alt="No Weapons" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-18794" height="241" src="https://oathkeepers.org/oath/wp-content/uploads/No-Weapons.jpg" title="No Weapons" width="400"/></p>
<p>The sign is not just a random one any anti-gunner can pick up at a rally.  This is a custom-made sign that someone spent some time and effort on, thinking it was going to make the restaurant a safer place for everyone.</p>
<p>The sign even points out that “no concealed firearms” are permissible on the property, so even gun owners who have been trained and licensed to carry handguns are not allowed to protect themselves in this establishment.</p>
<p><a href="http://youtu.be/sVBb4AnY5yA" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://youtu.be/sVBb4AnY5yA', 'httpv://youtu.be/sVBb4AnY5yA');">httpv://youtu.be/sVBb4AnY5yA</a></p>
<p>This should be a clear reminder that criminals don’t obey gun laws and they don’t obey signs on windows that say that can’t bring their guns inside.  These signs only stop law abiding citizens from being able to protect themselves and make the establishment a bigger target for crooks.  After all, why pick a target where people can shoot back at you?</p>
<p>Ironically, the owner’s original “The Pit Authentic Barbecue” in Raleigh was the same restaurant that hosted part of  Gabby Gifford’s anti-gun tour last year.</p>
<p>Look to see this story ignored by every anti-gun group on earth as it does not fit their narrative that “no gun” signs make everyone safer.</p>
<p>The war on the 2nd amendment is about more than just your guns. See how the coming crisis will result in more liberties being stripped away and learn what you can do to prepare.</p>

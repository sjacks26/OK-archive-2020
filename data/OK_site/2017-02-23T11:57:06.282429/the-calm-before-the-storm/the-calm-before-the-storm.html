<p>By Michael Snyder</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Have you noticed that things have gotten eerily quiet in the month of October?  After the chaos of late August and early September, many had anticipated that we would be dealing with a full-blown financial collapse by now, but instead we have entered a period of “dead calm” in which things have become exceedingly quiet in almost every way that you can possibly imagine.  Other “watchmen” that I highly respect have made the exact same observation.  Even though the economic numbers are screaming <a href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/global-trade-is-collapsing-as-the-worldwide-economic-recession-deepens" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/global-trade-is-collapsing-as-the-worldwide-economic-recession-deepens', 'that we have entered a global recession');" target="_blank"><span style="color: #0000ff;">that we have entered a global recession</span></a>, they aren’t really make any headline news.  A whole host of major financial institutions around the planet <a href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/20-reasons-why-all-the-people-that-quit-prepping-after-september-are-dead-wrong" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/20-reasons-why-all-the-people-that-quit-prepping-after-september-are-dead-wrong', 'are currently in danger of collapsing');" target="_blank"><span style="color: #0000ff;">are currently in danger of collapsing</span></a> and creating the next “Lehman Brothers moment”, but none of them has imploded just yet.  And of course Barack Obama seems bound and determined<a href="http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/is-barack-obama-actually-trying-to-start-world-war-iii" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/is-barack-obama-actually-trying-to-start-world-war-iii', ' to start World War III');" target="_blank"><span style="color: #0000ff;"> to start World War III</span></a>.  On Monday, it was announced that he is sending a guided missile destroyer into Chinese waters <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2015/10/26/navy-china-south-china-sea/74652962/" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2015/10/26/navy-china-south-china-sea/74652962/', 'in the South China Sea');" target="_blank"><span style="color: #0000ff;">in the South China Sea</span></a>.  The Chinese have already stated that they might just start shooting if this happens, but Barack Obama doesn’t seem to care.  But until the shooting actually begins, that is not likely to upset the current tranquility that we are enjoying either.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To me, what we are experiencing at the moment would best be described as “the calm before the storm”.  If you are not familiar with this concept, this is how it is defined by <a href="http://science.howstuffworks.com/nature/climate-weather/storms/calm-before-storm.htm" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://science.howstuffworks.com/nature/climate-weather/storms/calm-before-storm.htm', 'How Stuff Works');" target="_blank"><span style="color: #0000ff;">How Stuff Works</span></a>…</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Have you ever spent an afternoon in the backyard, maybe grilling or enjoying a game of croquet, when suddenly you notice that everything goes quiet? The air seems still and calm — even the birds stop singing and quickly return to their nests.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After a few minutes, you feel a change in the air, and suddenly a line of clouds ominously appears on the horizon — clouds with a look that tells you they aren’t fooling around. You quickly dash in the house and narrowly miss the first fat raindrops that fall right before the downpour. At this moment, you might stop and ask yourself, “Why was it so calm and peaceful right before the storm hit?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Like so many others, I believe that a great storm is coming, and yet right at this moment things seem so peaceful.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Unfortunately, this period of peace and quiet is not going to last for long, and most Americans know deep down that something is seriously wrong with our nation.  In fact, <a href="http://www.wnd.com/2015/10/nearly-everyone-agrees-u-s-going-in-wrong-direction/" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.wnd.com/2015/10/nearly-everyone-agrees-u-s-going-in-wrong-direction/', 'a new WND/Clout pol');" target="_blank"><span style="color: #0000ff;">a new WND/Clout pol</span></a>l has found that 85.3 percent of all likely voters in the United States believe that our country is going in the wrong direction…</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The poll found 92.6 percent of those who identified themselves as conservative believe the nation is on the wrong track. Among those who call themselves liberal, 90.9 percent said it is going the wrong direction.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When asked what they think of the American economy after seven years of Obama’s leadership and economic policies, nearly 80 percent described it as “very fragile” or “somewhat fragile.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Self-identified Democrats, Republicans, liberals and conservatives were in general agreement, with about 75 percent to 80 percent describing the economy as “somewhat fragile” or “very fragile.”</p>

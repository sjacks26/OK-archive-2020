<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><strong>By Brandon Smith, Associate Editor</strong></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">The Oath Keepers CPT (Community Preparedness Teams)  program is the BEST existing solution offered to the Liberty Movement today in the wake of numerous national and international crises.  I have not yet seen a single other program or effort that comes close in value to the general American public.  It combines all of the necessary knowledge, skills, and organization required for a community of people, no matter where they happen to live, to be able to survive and thrive a large scale disaster scenario, and to provide the ability to rebuild and help others once the smoke has cleared.</p>
<p>It should be obvious to most people by now, especially Constitutional activists, that America is already in the path of a great landslide of economic, social, and political instability.  This landslide cannot be stopped.  It cannot be turned back.  There are no silver bullet solutions, and there never will be.  Given this fact, we can continue to plead in futility for the corrupt establishment to police itself, curl up in a ball and be buried by the chaos, or, we can rise above it through dedicated preparation and organization.</p>
<p>The goal of CPT is to make every neighborhood, county, and state in the country as independent, secure, and self sufficient as possible, erasing the fear of the common citizen, which ultimately thwarts the rise of tyranny within our society.  A people without fear cannot be ruled.</p>
<p>CPT is not an exclusive club where high-speed-low-drag spec ops ninjas secretly train while keeping others outside the circle.  The training is intended for everyone, because the purpose is to make as many Americans competent in self reliance as possible.  We believe that ALL knowledge, including survival and tactical knowledge, should be made available to EVERY PERSON that wants it.  Period.  For only when each man and woman is prepared for any contingency will our culture change for the better.</p>
<p>My personal participation in the CPT program has been an excellent experience so far, and I feel that I should share some of that experience with others to perhaps help them in their own work building and organizing within their own part of the country.  This will be the first of many “journals” on the progress of the Eureka, MT CPT group.  I encourage others in CPT groups across the nation to submit their own CPT journals as well, with privacy concerns of individual members kept in mind.</p>
<p><strong>October 8<sup>th</sup>, 2014</strong></p>
<p>Eureka has spent the better part of the last few months diligently training in self defense scenarios.  Winter weather makes such training more difficult (though we will have cold weather training as well), so other preparedness classes have taken a back seat to tactical awareness during the summer and early fall.  The average Liberty Movement activist often trains in firearms mastery, but rarely trains within groups, which is a whole other ball game entirely.  Very careful instruction was given to new members for weeks before live fire practice was initiated.  Live fire events were tightly controlled by range instructors for safety purposes.  Members advanced very quickly, and gun handling improved vastly from their first shot, to their last shot.</p>
<p>Our members are all across the age spectrum, but we try to give each of them as much training as possible regardless of physical limitations.  It is important that every person know self defense techniques even if the chances are low that they will have to use them.</p>
<p>As training progresses, it becomes clear to most members what they are capable of and not capable of.  Because of the unfortunate culture of “keyboard warriors” in the movement today, active supervised training is the only way to truly know who is squared away and who is not.  It is not for trainers to decide for them; each individual knows after a time what their limits are.  Knowing what we cannot do, is just as important as knowing what we can do, and will surely save lives in the future.</p>
<p>As the cold weather months approach, the team will be shifting into other areas of preparedness and response.  We recently had a short lecture by our medically trained members on the rising Ebola scare which was enlightening, to say the least, and clarified for us even more the desperate need for expanded CPT teams in the U.S. as the failure of government to address the danger becomes more prominent.</p>
<p>Another member of the group also recently purchased a home freeze drying machine, which they have offered to lend to other members to put together a cost effective food storage supply.  The ability to freeze dry food, especially meats and proteins, is incredibly valuable.  Storage life of these packaged foods is seven years or more!</p>
<p>The group also took a break from highly focused training to enjoy themselves a little with an after-class party.  Liberty Movement singer/songwriter Jordan Page paid us a visit and played an excellent music set on his guitar.</p>
<p>Soon I will be starting an indoor class on hand to hand self defense, and a local combat medic will be giving an in depth course on combat medicine techniques.  Members will begin separating into their chosen fields of expertise in the near term, and reporting back with their own classes and presentations.</p>
<p>The group meets once a week, which is working out very well so far.  If people can’t dedicate at least one day a week for training, then they probably aren’t serious enough about preparedness.  Though, I expect this hunting season may lure away some of our members for one or two classes.  At least hunting is, in itself, a form of training.</p>
<p>The most important realization any survivalist can make is the realization that no single person can do everything on his own.  Without the mutual aid of others, most of them will not last very long during a crisis.  Oath Keepers CPT fills this massive gap in the current survival ideology.  The lone wolf mentality is utterly flawed, and makes the overall movement weak.  Our greatest accomplishment through CPT, I hope, will be the debunking of the lone wolf myth, resulting finally in active organization of Americans into effective voluntary preparedness groups able to teach others and replicate this vital knowledge forever.</p>
<p>This is Brandon Smith, Oath Keepers Associate Editor and member of the Eureka CPT, signing out.</p>

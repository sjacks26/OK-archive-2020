MPAO: Would we take away people’s guns? Frankly, I don’t see that happening.

NOPD: No one will be able to be armed. We’re gonna take all weapons.

MPAO: Marines obey orders. When we’re ordered to carry out a mission, we carry out that mission.

Caption: And if that order is an “unlawful order?” (0:03:05.1)

MPAO: Marines have the right to refuse an unlawful order. So if a Marine is given an order that he knows violates the law, the Marine has the right not to obey that order.

SR: Every service member has an obligation, not just that they can refuse an illegal or unlawful order. They have an obligation to, they have to. So they have to make a decision for themselves where that line is.

Caption: 1. We will NOT obey orders to disarm the American people. (0:03:45.9) 2. We will NOT obey orders to conduct warrantless searches of the American people. 3. We will NOT obey orders to detain American citizens as “unlawful enemy combatants.” 4. We will NOT obey orders to impose martial law or a “state of emergency” on any state. (0:04:21.9) 5. We will NOT obey orders to invade or subjugate any state that asserts its sovereignty. 6. We will NOT obey orders to blockade American cities, thus turning them into giant concentration camps.

Giraldo Rivera: There is no earthly answer that anyone can understand why these people after 6 days are still in this filthy, miserable convention center. Why are they still here? There’s the freeway here. I would have, I still would let them walk out of here, away from the filth and devastation and dead bodies.

Shepard Smith: They won’t let them walk out of there because I’m standing right above that convention center (0:05:18.9). They’ve locked them in there. The government said you go here, you’ll get help. Or you go in that Superdome and you’ll get help, and they didn’t get help. They got locked in there and they watched people being killed around them. And they watched people starving and elderly people not getting medicine. And now they know it’s happening, because we’ve been telling them repeatedly, over and over, every day. You know what they’re doing now? And I’m not blaming anyone, I’m telling you what’s happening. They have set up a checkpoint at the bottom of this bridge. This is the bridge that takes you from New Orleans over into Gretna. From Orleans Parish into Jefferson Parish. It’s the only way out, it’s the connection to the rest of the world. And they’ve set up a checkpoint, and anyone who walks up out of that city now is turned around. You are not allowed to go to Gretna, Louisiana from New Orleans, Louisiana. Over there, there’s hope, there’s electricity, food and water. But you cannot go from there to there. The government will not allow you to do it. (0:06:17.4)

GR: I don’t know man, let them walk out of here. Let them walk the hell out of here. Let them get on the interstate and walk out. (0:06:29.9)

Aaron Broussard, president of Jefferson Parish: We had Walmart deliver three trucks of water. FEMA turned them back. They said we didn’t need them. This was a week ago. We had a thousand gallons of diesel fuel on a Coast Guard vessel docked in my parish. The Coast Guard said come get the fuel right away. When we got there with our trucks, they got the word, FEMA says don’t give you the fuel. Yesterday, FEMA came and cut all of our emergency communication lines, without notice. Our sheriff went back and connected them, he posted armed guards on our line and said no one is getting near these lines. (0:07:07.0)

## Picture has the caption “House to House,” shows a man in a booney hat banging on a door. Then a man in army green, camo, and a bullet proof vest enters a door. Fox News video of a woman in her kitchen, with a pistol in her hand, grabbed around the cylinder rather than with the butt in her hand with her finger on the trigger. A police officer takes her to the ground on camera. News chyron says “New Orleans Resident Patricia Konie.” Video shows her being led out by both arms.

SR: That’s why we issue our declaration of 10 orders we will not obey. Those are designed to get troops thinking ahead of time about what they want to plan in advance. That’s what we’re hearing feedback from people, National Guard units, that in Katrina, that’s what happened. The police and military there, the National Guardsmen were caught off guard and really hadn’t thought about it in advance.

Unidentified uniformed man: Walking up and down these streets, you don’t (0:07:36.0) want to think about what you have to do, if somebody pops around the corner.

Person off camera: Would you shoot an American?

UUM: Yeah.

SR: We’re hearing it won’t be the same next time. More people will say no, I’m not going to do that.

Caption: 7. We will Not obey any order to force American citizens into any form of detention camps (0:07:57.0). 8. We will NOT obey orders to assist or support the use of any foreign troops on U.S. soil. 9. We will NOT obey any orders to confiscate the property of the American people, including food and other essential supplies.

Caption: 10. We will NOT obey any orders which infringe on the rights of the people… to free speech, to peaceably assemble, and to petition their government for a redress of grievances. 

Caption: (0:08:47.3) And for the support of this Declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of Divine Providence, we mutually affirm our oath and pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes, and our sacred Honor. Oath Keepers

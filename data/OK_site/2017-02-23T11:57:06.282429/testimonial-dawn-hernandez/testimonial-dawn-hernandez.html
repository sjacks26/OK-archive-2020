<p>Testimonial:  Hello from a new, and proud, member of Oath Keepers! I took my first oath as a child, actually, from learning my family’s proud history of military service and service to community. Mine was predominantly a Naval family; however, back then, women were not allowed on ships and mostly served as nurses, clerks and sometimes, mechanics. Having grown up on a farm and been taught by an Arkansas mountain man, I learned animal husbandry, gardening, fishing, hunting and tracking from the time I could walk. I learned to ride at the age of 4 and went on to have a passion for horses that abides to this day.</p>
<p>I took my first official oath in May of 1976 when I joined the United States Army as a member of the Women’s Army Corp. It was soon after that we were phased out of the Corp and became just plain soldiers. I did my boot at Ft. Jackson, SC and also my primary MOS, 36K or Field Communications. My secondary MOS was 75C or Personnel Management, which I learned at Ft. Ben Harrison, IN. After separating active duty, I went on to a couple of enlistments in the Reserves.</p>
<p>During the reserve years, I worked in private security, with specialized training in industrial security and corporate espionage. I then switched specialties to educational/campus security and terrorism. I just retired a year ago due to health reasons.</p>
<p>I guess what I would say to the younger folks wanting to contribute, would be: Millions have given, and millions have given all. You young people will be our boots on the ground; us old fogies can teach. I have a wealth of knowledge that I do not want to die with me; I will gladly give it to you.</p>
<p>The country that I am passing to my two boys (both also veterans) is not the same country that I grew up in. We are no longer led by wise learned men, but by slick used car salesmen (no offense to the car salesmen out there!) Our Congress and Senate do not seem to have the cojones to lead us away from the cliff’s edge. They no longer listen to the people. The government no longer exists to serve the people; the people exist to serve them–that is the attitude that is killing this country. We have to remind them. YOU have to remind them!</p>
<p>I apologize for being long-winded, but this is a subject that I am very passionate about. I won’t be around much longer so it’s a moot point for me. However, I want YOU to inherit the country you were meant to have! Thank you for giving me the chance to wax philosophical.</p>

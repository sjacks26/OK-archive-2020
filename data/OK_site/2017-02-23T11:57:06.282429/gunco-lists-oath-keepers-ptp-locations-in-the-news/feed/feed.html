<content:encoded>Sometimes seems hard to tell the difference between the ‚Äúbad guy‚Äù and our government.  Most of our ‚Äúleaders‚Äù shouldn‚Äôt be allowed to play with matches.  Sorry to say.

<content:encoded>I am torn between being out in the open or being covert. Being out in the open is in a big way putting a target on your back. Not so much by terrorist but by locale law enforcement and our government. My biggest fear is what our government will do and not the foolish terrorist.

<content:encoded>Kniferights.org may have further information. I teach combative hand,knife and stick skills, and anything can be used a weapon but in a clinch, knowledge is power, so find a place to learn combative skills, guns are a must, but unarmed what you know can save you.<br/>
Keep a blade handy and your powder dry.

<content:encoded>‚Äì as an Oathkeeper,  [ unfortunately, and due to poor logistics -and not enough OK‚Äôs for the very broad area,..]   I have been working,  ( quite ‚Äòincognito‚Äô, with CC‚Ä¶)  in conjunction with NYR  [New York Revolution]  in their efforts of similar defense watch in south central NYS‚Ä¶.  Specifically, in Oneonta, and Vestal (near Binghamton) keeping an eye on the recruit centers at both places 55 miles apart‚Ä¶ Today however I decided to wear my black / yellow OK shirt ( under a ‚Äòdressy shirt with collar )  just to ‚Äòadvertise‚Äô just a bit ‚Ä¶. üòâ
<p>                My experiences have paralleled others   ‚Äì except my interactions have been ‚Ä¶100% positive! </p>
<p>And I have had conversations with many, both military AND citizen alike.  Many citizens have provided goodies, water,  even the offer of air conditioning inside their store,,,  it‚Äôs been gratifying.  One lady last week showed up one morning with $50 worth of a ‚Äòlarge‚Äô cooler‚Ä¶packed full of berries, candy, fruit, and many assorted bottles of something cold to drink, and said ‚ÄúThis is for you guys, I‚Äôm so proud of you..‚Äù  She must have read about the ‚Äòcitizens‚Äô operation from the local paper the day before -complete with photos‚Ä¶ </p>
<p>Today another gal walked up out of the blue, and handed me a 2 quart bottle of cold water and expressed the same sympathies‚Ä¶ Upon closing a bit early tonight, at 5:30,  an Army Officer went looking for me (I had gone next door to the burger place, on a 2 min. nature call‚Ä¶)   And when I came out he said :  ‚Äù Oh, there you are‚Ä¶ we‚Äôre done for today, and when I didn‚Äôt see you by the door, I went looking for you because I didn‚Äôt want you sitting outside for another 2 hours( in the heat)  ‚Ä¶with us already gone‚Ä¶‚Äù  I was struck by his kindness, and then he added ‚Äúwe appreciate you guys‚Äù   -which of course made my day.  I replied, ‚Äòwe appreciate you guys too, and that‚Äôs why we‚Äôre here‚Äô‚Ä¶ It was a very good conversation‚Ä¶ He left for home with a handful of OK business cards to ‚Äúgive to the boys‚Äù    -as I put it‚Ä¶</p>
<p>yes, I would say‚Ä¶  It was a very good conversation.</p>
<p>Stewart‚Äôs observation of   ‚Äù we are making long overdue connections in our local community that will pay important dividends as we work hard to get our communities better prepared for whatever is to come. ‚Äù </p>
<p>-is SPOT ON.     ~ I fully agree ~</p>
<p>Problematic however in these parts is manpower;  I learned that NYR is ‚Äúpulling the plug‚Äù -as of today.<br/>
In fact the NYR guy who initiated the Vestal detail was -not there- when I arrived today @ 2:15‚Ä¶  not good‚Ä¶</p>
<p>So there is quite a disconnect in South Central NY.<br/>
HOWEVER, I plan on continuing, as much as one crusty ol‚Äô cur can‚Ä¶</p>
<p>Anyone reading this that wants to help on this important defensive -and- PR detail,<br/>
get in touch with me &amp; we can coordinate.   Please DO.    </p>
<p> [  either through leaving a msg. here, or contact Elias Alias to ask for my contact email  ]  </p>
<p>                      ~    GOD BLESS AMERICA   ~   GOD BLESS OUR TROOPS.   ~</p>

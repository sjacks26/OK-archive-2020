Why would you give such an establishment your business, especially when there are plenty of competitors who respect your rights?</p></div>
<p>“[A] soldier with the National Guard was told to leave his gun outside of the Nicholasville Waffle House or he wouldn’t be served,” <strong><a href="http://www.lex18.com/story/30134712/restaurant-refuses-service-to-soldier-for-carrying-firearm" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.lex18.com/story/30134712/restaurant-refuses-service-to-soldier-for-carrying-firearm', 'NBC’s Lex18.com affiliate reported');" target="_blank">NBC’s Lex18.com affiliate reported</a></strong>. Billy Welch opted instead to leave.</p>
<p>“For many years we have had a ‘No Firearms’ police [sic] in place in our restaurants,” the franchise  owner stated. “We continue to believe this is the best policy for the safety of our customers and associates.”</p>
<p>Why he believes that is left unsaid. It’s not like Waffle House hasn’t had direct experience with the protective crime-deterrent benefits of lawful carry, such as the time an armed robber threatening the lives of patrons and employees was <strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140701093310/http:/www.examiner.com/article/relatives-of-criminal-shot-trying-to-hold-up-waffle-house-demand-gun-control?" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20140701093310/http:/www.examiner.com/article/relatives-of-criminal-shot-trying-to-hold-up-waffle-house-demand-gun-control?', 'justifiably shot and killed by an armed customer');" target="_blank">justifiably shot and killed by an armed customer</a></strong>—prompting demands for making it harder for good people to carry from an indignant cousin of the deceased thug.</p>
<p>Waffle House is now reportedly justifying its actions <strong><a href="http://www.eater.com/2015/9/30/9423481/waffle-house-refused-serve-armed-soldier-owner-statement-guns" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.eater.com/2015/9/30/9423481/waffle-house-refused-serve-armed-soldier-owner-statement-guns', 'claiming');" target="_blank">claiming</a></strong> Welch had been involved in a fight at their restaurant a few weeks prior. Curiously, the Eater.com report says that statement has been taken down from the Lex18 site where it reportedly was originally posted. The bottom line is, it’s a diversion to mask discrimination against all gun owners.</p>
<p>“Waffle House does have a company-wide policy banning guns, law enforcement is excepted from the rule,” the report continues. “However, the chain’s corporate communications department told Eater yesterday that as a franchise-owned outlet, the location in question may enforce slightly different rules.”</p>
<p>In other words, police are the “Only Ones” trustworthy enough to bear arms at Waffle House.  Everyone recalls <strong><a href="http://www.thesmokinggun.com/documents/bizarre/dea-agent-foot-shoot-suit" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.thesmokinggun.com/documents/bizarre/dea-agent-foot-shoot-suit', 'how that term originated');" target="_blank">how that term originated</a></strong>, right? And Waffle House corporate weasels would evidently rather see you dead than armed.</p>
<p>My friends at The Firearms Coalition have devised <strong><a href="http://www.firearmscoalition.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=356&amp;Itemid=133" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.firearmscoalition.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=356&amp;Itemid=133', 'an educational card');" target="_blank">an educational card</a></strong> for businesses that post “No Guns” signs on their premises, and recommend handing them out to misguided proprietors. Similarly, groups like Ohioans for Concealed Carry have cards declaring “<strong><a href="http://secure.ohioccw.org/store/p/38-No-Guns-No-Money-Cards-25/pk.aspx" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://secure.ohioccw.org/store/p/38-No-Guns-No-Money-Cards-25/pk.aspx', 'No Guns = No Money');" target="_blank">No Guns = No Money</a></strong>,” and various groups have compiled lists of<strong> <a href="http://www.2acheck.com/the-boycott-list/" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.2acheck.com/the-boycott-list/', 'anti-gun businesses to avoid');" target="_blank">anti-gun businesses to avoid</a></strong>. There’s even <strong><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/posted!-carry-list-anti-gun/id530004581?mt=8" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/posted!-carry-list-anti-gun/id530004581?mt=8', 'an app for that');" target="_blank">an app for that</a></strong>.</p>
<p>Obviously, it would be difficult to know all the companies to refuse to patronize, although having a “No Guns” sign posted merits an immediate “No Business” response. Waffle House seems a pretty good candidate, as gun owners no doubt make up a significant percentage of its customer base. The profit margins at such places are hardly high enough to give such an advantage to their competitors on a sustained basis, so <a href="https://www.oathkeepers.org/who-speaks-for-oath-keepers/" target="_blank"><strong>speaking for myself</strong></a>, I’ll never set foot in one again until they change their policy, publicly apologize, and begin proactively supporting and promoting the right to keep and bear arms.</p>
<p>Waffle House would actually be a great candidate to single out and make an example of. If they dig their heels in and go belly-up, who cares? And if they end up doing the right thing, it will be an in-your-face victory that’ll cause a very public Demanding <a href="http://waronguns.blogspot.com/2014/02/milms.html" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://waronguns.blogspot.com/2014/02/milms.html', 'MILM');" target="_blank"><strong>MILM</strong></a> hysterical meltdown.</p>
<p>I also have one other card that you can feel free to hand to businesses, either as is or modified to your liking. It challenges the business owner to sign a contract accepting a legal duty to protect anyone it requires to disarm on their premises, a copy of which is included above in the graphic accompanying this column, and <strong><a href="https://www.scribd.com/doc/282774736/Mandated-Disarmament-Contract" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'https://www.scribd.com/doc/282774736/Mandated-Disarmament-Contract', 'downloadable for printing here');" target="_blank">downloadable for printing here</a></strong>.</p>
<p>I encourage you to use it, or one of the other cards, whenever you encounter a “No Guns” sign at a business you would otherwise be likely to patronize.  I know many would rather just avoid speaking out altogether, but unless you tell them why they won’t get your business, you can’t assume they’ll know, and it’s unlikely they’ll change. Figure for everyone who tells them, you probably represent a hundred who agree but just keep quiet.  And don’t forget you can also spread the message via the still underutilized <strong><a href="../oath-keepers-must-be-force-multipliers-to-ensure-truth-is-shared/index.html" target="_blank">force multiplier power of social media</a></strong>.</p>
<p>By the way, I already sent my card to Waffle House via their Facebook and Twitter pages last month, and of course they ignored it.  If more chose to join in, they would be more attentive proportional to the number of people following suit.</p>
<p>By virtue of the fact that you’re even on this website, you’ve aligned yourself with the ideological leadership in restoring the Constitution and promoting a Bill of Rights culture. I hope you’ll show that same leadership in letting anti-gun companies know they can take their stupid and evil policies and either get on the right side or go broke with them.</p>

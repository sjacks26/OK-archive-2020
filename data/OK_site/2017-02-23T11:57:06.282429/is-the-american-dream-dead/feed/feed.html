<content:encoded>Unfortunately my friends, my countrymen, my brothers…”it is finished”…. When only a fraction of the original populous even question, let alone remember, or care to remember; our sacrifices, what we were, what we stood for??? One world PC has dominated our lives/culture. It no longer matters that we were, only what we have become. The vast “majority” of young people I know say they are willing to give up their freedoms to be “protected”. They care more about their “likes”, than actual LIFE. If YOU truly want to make a change, a difference, You have to teach the young what we, yes WE, have taken from them. I will give anything for my young son to feel the pride, the willingness to sacrifice, the honor,  for a country that IS his. His dad’s. His papas. And so on….it begins at home my compatriots…

<content:encoded>Here’s my answer, NO….” We have not yet begun to fight”, “Give me liberty or give me death”. Do these statements mean nothing or did our founding fathers suffer and die in vain? <a href="http://mainerepublicemailalert.com/2016/02/10/update-from-judge-anna/" rel="nofollow">http://mainerepublicemailalert.com/2016/02/10/update-from-judge-anna/</a>

<content:encoded>There comes a point when there is nothing left to fight for. I’m 32 years old. I do not personally know anyone my age, or younger whom has what one would call prosperity. 
<p>People can not improve their homes without a building permit. People pay property tax, which is rent. We the people have free speech zones and gun free zones. We learn about the holocaust, but not about the Japanese bubonic plague fleas. We never hear about the 20 plus million Stalin killed. Schools don’t tell you about Belgium, Congo, and Leopold 2. We give away foreign aid, fight radical Muslims, and keep the roads paved on military bases in over a hundred countries. We never consider how we would feel if China built a military base in Ohio.</p>
<p>We laugh at Homer Simpson sleeping at his job at a nuclear power plant, but don’t get furious when journalists show sleeping or absent guards, and pay little attention to whistleblowers. Our government has no problem using tax payer money to sue Volkswagen though. We splice scorpion DNA into cabbage, and eat food that other countries won’t accept during a famine. We drink and shower with fluoridated water coming through pipes that cities don’t fix until they crumble. We export more jobs than we do goods. We’re in more binding alliances than we can manage. We must get our Gestapo papers, vaccines and retinal scan to travel abroad. We live in a country with privatized prisons, microwave crowd control, and spend a currency that is loaned to our government by a private bank, at interest.</p>
<p>So someone please tell me, is this George Orwell’s 1984, or is this Idiocracy? We buy fireworks from china, and flags made in Malaysia to celebrate our independence. Is there a line in the sand? Maybe, but its probably not going to be noticed when it gets crossed. Did you see that Bronco defense? We need taxpayer funded power outlets every 30 feet with glade plugins, because it all stinks. I’d like to believe that a movement could change things, but George Washington did too. Abraham Lincoln and JFK share something in common, but most people don’t know. </p>
<p>Anonymous hacking the 6 o’clock news would do more than 10,000 patriots blood flowing, and Eminem could write a song about Flint Michigan and cause terror in the hearts of those involved by saying names. That’s where we are. Will the real slim shady please stand up?</p>
<p>It is a shame that Lavoy Finicum died. It is a shame Ammon Bundy and many others are facing prison. It is a shame that were at this point. Sadly, restoring  liberty requires people knowing what it is, plus wanting it, and re-education of 100 plus million is the real battle.</p>

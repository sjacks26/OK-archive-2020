<content:encoded>Hello, retired military, i am seeking information on a possible member of the morristown nj oath keepers chapter. I play on line poker with an individual who has been sick and have not heard from hin in a few weeks. I have very little info on him I do know this, retired from att, after that opened on business, ex airforce, used mike as screen name and lived near morristown. He was also involved as a volunteer firefighter. If you have any information i would appreciate hearing from you. thank you, bill

<content:encoded>I totally agree with you. I joined oath keepers over 6 years ago hoping that I would meet up with like minded patriots who share the same views, I have yet to meet anyone from SJ who cares. It just seems like the closer we get to the NWO fulfillment the less likely we run into anybody who care.

<content:encoded>I joined the oath keepers 6 years ago because I believe in the same values and have the same passion that I thought the founder had. At first I was excited to be a part of something that I was lead to believe would be growing. There are a lot of us who see the direction this country has gone and sometimes it would be nice to meet up with the same like minded patriots that one could sit down and fellowship together.   But after after i joined the oath keepers I soon found out that that was not going to happen. I think it’s important to have that contact form time to time because one can not share his or hers true passion about what’s going wrong with this country through facebook that we all know is monitored.

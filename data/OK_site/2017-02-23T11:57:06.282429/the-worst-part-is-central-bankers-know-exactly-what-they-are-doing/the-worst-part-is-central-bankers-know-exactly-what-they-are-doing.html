<p>The best position for a tyrant or tyrants to be in, at least while consolidating power, is tyranny by proxy. That is to say, the most dangerous tyrants are those the people do not recognize: the tyrants who hide behind scarecrows and puppets and faceless organizations. The worst position for the common citizen to be in is a false sense of security and understanding, operating on the assumption that tyrants do not exist or that potential tyrants are really just greedy fools acting independently from one another.</p>
<p>Sadly, there are a great many people today who hold naïve notions that our sociopolitical dynamic is driven by random chaos, greed and fear. I’m sorry to say that this is simply not so, and anyone who believes such nonsense is doomed to be victimized by the tides of history over and over again.</p>
<p>There is nothing random or coincidental about our political systems or economic structures. There are no isolated tyrants and high-level criminals functioning solely on greed and ignorance. And while there is certainly chaos, this chaos is invariably engineered, not accidental. These crisis events are created by people who often refer to themselves as “globalists” or “internationalists,” and their goals are rather obvious and sometimes openly admitted: at the top of their list is the complete centralization of government and economic power that is then ACCEPTED by the people as preferable. They hope to attain this goal primarily through the exploitation of puppet politicians around the world as well as the use of pervasive banking institutions as weapons of mass fiscal destruction.</p>
<p>Their strategic history is awash in wars and financial disasters, and not because they are incompetent. They are evil, not stupid.</p>
<p>By extension, perhaps the most dangerous lie circulating today is that central banks are chaotic operations run by intellectual idiots who have no clue what they are doing. This is nonsense. While the ideological cultism of elitism and globalism is ignorant and monstrous at its core, these people function rather successfully through highly organized collusion. Their principles are subhuman, but their strategies are invasive and intelligent.</p>
<p>That’s right; there is a conspiracy afoot, and this conspiracy requires created destruction as cover and concealment. Central banks and the private bankers who run them work together regardless of national affiliations to achieve certain objectives, and they all serve a greater agenda. If you would like to learn more about the details behind what motivates globalists, at least in the financial sense, read my article <a href="http://www.alt-market.com/articles/2403-the-economic-end-game-explained" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.alt-market.com/articles/2403-the-economic-end-game-explained', '‘The Economic Endgame Explained.’');">‘The Economic Endgame Explained.’</a></p>
<p>Many people, including insiders, have written extensively about central banks and their true intentions to centralize and rule the masses through manipulation, if not direct political domination. I think Carroll Quigley, Council on Foreign Relations insider and mentor to Bill Clinton, presents the reality of our situation quite clearly in his book “Tragedy And Hope”:</p>
<p><em><strong>“The powers of financial capitalism had another far-reaching aim, nothing less than to create a world system of financial control in private hands able to dominate the political system of each country and the economy of the world as a whole. This system was to be controlled in a feudalist fashion by the central banks of the world acting in concert, by secret agreements arrived at in frequent private meetings and conferences. The apex of the system was to be the Bank for International Settlements in Basel, Switzerland, a private bank owned and controlled by the world’s central banks which were themselves private corporations. Each central bank … sought to dominate its government by its ability to control Treasury loans, to manipulate foreign exchanges, to influence the level of economic activity in the country, and to influence cooperative politicians by subsequent economic rewards in the business world.”</strong></em></p>
<p>This “world system of financial control” that Quigley speaks of has not yet been achieved, but the globalists have been working tirelessly towards such a goal.  The plan for a single global currency system and a single global economic authority is outlined rather blatantly in an article published in the Rothschild owned ‘The Economist’ entitled <a href="https://socioecohistory.wordpress.com/2014/07/26/flashback-1988-get-ready-for-a-world-currency-by-2018%E2%80%B3-the-economist-magazine/" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'https://socioecohistory.wordpress.com/2014/07/26/flashback-1988-get-ready-for-a-world-currency-by-2018%E2%80%B3-the-economist-magazine/', '‘Get Ready For A Global Currency By 2018’');">‘Get Ready For A Global Currency By 2018’</a>.  This article was written in 1988, and much of the process of globalization it describes is already well underway.  It is a plan that is at least decades in the making.  Again, it is foolhardy to assume central banks and international bankers are a bunch of clumsy Mr. Magoos unwittingly driving our economy off a cliff; they know EXACTLY what they are doing.</p>
<p>Being the clever tyrants that they are, the members of the central banking cult hope you are too stupid or too biased to grasp the concept of conspiracy. They prefer that you see them as bumbling idiots, as children who found their father’s shotgun or who like to play with matches because in your assumptions and underestimations they find safety. If you cannot identify the agenda, you can do nothing to interfere with the agenda.</p>
<p>I have found that the false notion of central bank impotence is growing in popularity lately, certainly in light of the recent Fed decision to delay an interest rate hike in September. With that particular event in mind, let’s explore what is really going on and why the central banks are far more dangerous and deliberate than people are giving them credit for.</p>
<p>The argument that the Federal Reserve is now “between a rock and a hard place” keeps popping up in alternative media circles lately, but I find this depiction to be inaccurate. It presumes that the Federal Reserve “wants”  to save the U.S. economy or at least wants to maintain our status quo as the “golden goose.” This is not the case.  America is not the golden goose.  In truth, the Fed is exactly where it wants to be; and it is the American people who are trapped economically rather than the bankers.</p>
<p>Take, for instance, the original Fed push for the taper of quantitative easing; why did the Fed pursue this in the first place? QE and zero interest rate policy (ZIRP) are the two pillars holding up U.S. equities markets and U.S. bonds. No one in the mainstream was demanding that the Fed enact taper measures. And when the Fed more publicly introduced the potential for such measures in the fall of 2013, no one believed it would actually follow through. Why? Because removing a primary support pillar from under the “golden goose” seemed incomprehensible to them.</p>
<p>In September of that year, I argued that the Fed would indeed taper QE. And, in my article <a href="http://personalliberty.com/is-the-fed-ready-to-cut-americas-fiat-life-support/" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://personalliberty.com/is-the-fed-ready-to-cut-americas-fiat-life-support/', '“Is The Fed Ready To Cut America’s Fiat Life Support?”');" rel="”nofollow”" target="_blank">“Is The Fed Ready To Cut America’s Fiat Life Support?”</a> I gave my reasons why. In short, I felt the Fed was preparing for the final collapse of our economic system and the taper acted as a kind of control valve, making a path for the next leg down without immediate destabilization. I also argued that all stimulus measures have a shelf life, and the shelf life for all QE and ZIRP is quickly coming to an end. They no longer serve a purpose except to marginally slow the collapse of certain sectors, so the Fed is systematically dismantling them.</p>
<p>I received numerous emails, some civil and some hostile, as to why I was crazy to think the Fed would ever end QE. I knew the taper would be instituted because I was willing to accept the real motivation of central banks, which is to undermine and destroy economies within a particular time frame, not secure economies or kick the can indefinitely. In light of this, the taper made sense. One great pillar is gone, and now only ZIRP remains.</p>
<p>After a couple of meetings and preplanned delays, the Fed did indeed follow through with the taper in December of that year. In response, energy markets essentially imploded and stocks became steadily more volatile over the course of 2014, leading to a near 10% drop in early fall followed by foreign QE efforts and false hints of QE4 by Fed officials as central banks slowed the crisis to an easier to manage pace while easing the investment world into the idea of reduced stimulus policies and reduced living standards; what some call the “new normal”.</p>
<p>I <a href="http://personalliberty.com/you-will-hear-these-lies-as-the-economic-collapse-progresses/" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://personalliberty.com/you-will-hear-these-lies-as-the-economic-collapse-progresses/', 'have held');" rel="”nofollow”" target="_blank">have held</a> that the Fed is likely following the same exact model with ZIRP, delaying through the fall only to remove the final pillar in December.</p>
<p>For now, the Fed is being portrayed as incompetent with markets behaving erratically as investors lose faith in their high priests. This is exactly what the bankers that control the Fed prefer. Better to be seen as incompetent than to be seen as deliberately insidious. And who knows, maybe a convenient disaster event in the meantime such as a terrorist attack or war (Syria) could be used to draw attention away from the bankers completely.</p>
<p>Strangely, <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-09-17/yellen-may-emulate-taper-template-and-raise-rates-in-december" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-09-17/yellen-may-emulate-taper-template-and-raise-rates-in-december', 'Bloomberg');" target="_blank">Bloomberg</a> seems to agree (at least in part) with my view that the taper model is being copied for use in the rate hike theater and that a hike is coming in December.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, some Federal Reserve officials once again <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-09-19/fed-officials-make-case-for-2015-liftoff-after-september-hold" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-09-19/fed-officials-make-case-for-2015-liftoff-after-september-hold', 'insinuate');" target="_blank">insinuate</a> that a hike will be implemented by the end of the year while others hint at the opposite.</p>
<p>Other mainstream sources are stating the contrary, with Pimco arguing that there will be <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-09-17/treasuries-gain-as-federal-reserve-delays-raising-interest-rates" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-09-17/treasuries-gain-as-federal-reserve-delays-raising-interest-rates', 'no Fed rate hike');">no Fed rate hike</a> until 2016.  Of course, Pimco made a similar claim back in 2013 against any chance of a QE taper.  They <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-01-03/gross-s-mistake-on-fed-taper-echoes-across-pimco-funds" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-01-03/gross-s-mistake-on-fed-taper-echoes-across-pimco-funds', 'were wrong');">were wrong</a>, or, they were deliberately misleading investors.</p>
<p>Goldman Sachs is also redrafting their predictions and indicating that a Fed rate hike will not come until mid-2016. With evidence indicating that Goldman Sachs holds considerable influence over Fed policy (such as exposed <a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/article/why-does-brian-sack-interact-goldmans-fx-committee" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.zerohedge.com/article/why-does-brian-sack-interact-goldmans-fx-committee', 'private meetings on policy');">private meetings on policy</a> between Fed officials and banking CEO’s), one might argue that whatever they “predict” for the rate hike will ultimately happen. However, I would point out that if Goldman Sachs is indeed on the inside of Fed policy making, then they are often <a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/article/why-does-brian-sack-interact-goldmans-fx-committee" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.zerohedge.com/article/why-does-brian-sack-interact-goldmans-fx-committee', 'prone');" target="_blank">prone</a> to lying about it or hiding it.</p>
<p>During the taper fiasco in 2013, Goldman Sachs first claimed that the Fed would taper in September. They <a href="http://www.valuewalk.com/2013/11/goldman-sachs-loses-1-billion/" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.valuewalk.com/2013/11/goldman-sachs-loses-1-billion/', 'lost');" target="_blank">lost</a> billions of dollars on bad currency bets as the Fed delayed.</p>
<p>Then, Goldman Sachs argued that there would be no taper in December of that year; and they were <a href="http://secularinvestor.com/goldman-sachs-tapering-december/3870/" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://secularinvestor.com/goldman-sachs-tapering-december/3870/', 'proven');" target="_blank">proven</a> to be wrong (or disingenuous) once again.</p>
<p>Today, with the interest rate fiasco, Goldman Sachs claimed a Fed rate hike would likely take place in September. They were wrong. Now, once again, they are claiming no rate hike until next year.</p>
<p>Are we beginning to see a pattern here?</p>
<p>How could an elitist-run bank with proven inside connections to the Federal Reserve be so wrong so often about Fed policy changes? Well, losing a billion dollars here and there is not a very big deal to Goldman Sachs. I believe they are far more interested in misleading investors and keeping the public off guard, and are willing to sacrifice some nominal profits in the process. Remember, these are the same guys who conned nations like Greece into buying toxic derivatives that Goldman was simultaneously betting against!</p>
<p>The relationship between international banks like Goldman Sachs and central banks like the Federal Reserve is best summed up in yet another Carroll Quigley quote from “Tragedy And Hope”:</p>
<p><em><strong>“It must not be felt that these heads of the world’s chief central banks were themselves substantive powers in world finance. They were not. Rather, they were the technicians and agents of the dominant investment bankers of their own countries, who had raised them up and were perfectly capable of throwing them down. The substantive financial powers of the world were in the hands of these investment bankers (also called “international” or “merchant” bankers) who remained largely behind the scenes in their own unincorporated private banks. These formed a system of international cooperation and national dominance which was more private, more powerful, and more secret than that of their agents in the central banks.”</strong></em></p>
<p>Goldman Sachs and other major banks act in concert with the Fed (or even dictate Fed actions) in conditioning public psychology as much as they manipulate finance. First and foremost, globalists require confusion. Confusion is power.  What better way to confuse and mislead the investment world than to place bad bets on Fed policy changes?</p>
<p>Heading into the end of 2015, we are only going to be faced with ever mounting mixed messages and confusion from the mainstream media, international banks and central banks. It is important to always remember, though, that this is by design. A common motto of the elite is “order out of chaos,” or “never let a good crisis go to waste.” Think critically about why the Fed has chosen to push forward with earth-shaking policy changes this year that no one asked for. What does it have to gain? And realize that if the real goal of the Fed is instability, then it has much to gain through its recent and seemingly insane actions.</p>

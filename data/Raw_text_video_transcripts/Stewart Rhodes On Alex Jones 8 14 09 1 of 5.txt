AJ: Total martial law and using this as the cover to do that. I’m looking for it here in my stack. There’s just too many of these to keep track of. German news is reporting there is live cancer viruses in the main vaccine that’s being distributed. That’s why we have OK on, SR, the founder of it with us today. We’re going to go to him. Mr. Rhodes started OK, he was a high level aide in Ron Paul’s congressional office and presidential campaign, he’s ex-army. He’s the founder and director of OK, military veterans and peace officers who will honor their oaths to defend the Constitution, will not just follow orders, will stand up for liberty and save the republic, so help us god. Our motto is not on our watch. It’s a nonpartisan association of currently serving military and reserve, national guard, peace officers, veterans who swore an oath to support and defend the Constitution against all enemies foreign and domestic. He is a Yale law school graduate and was an Army officer. Give us your exact bio, Stewart.

SR: I was a paratrooper, I was enlisted, I worked for a living. I was a paratrooper until I was disabled in a parachuting accident.

AJ: Okay. Let’s get started here. You’ve heard me throw all this out. The main reason I have you on is the SPLC has put out a report mixing us in with white supremacists, UFO cults, you name it. Specifically they attack us together here in this piece.

SR: (0:01:42.9) Yes they do. They quote our interview, where they say that Rhodes told conspiracy minded radio host Alex Jones, imagine if we focus on police and military, game over for the New World Order. I want to thank them for pulling that quote out, I had forgotten about it. I think it’s a pretty good quote. They’re doing the same thing they’ve done throughout the past few decades. Anyone who gets to be a threat to the orthodox [garbled] plan, they will attack and try to smear and lump in with racists. [Garbled] you’re racist because a black president is in office, you must be racist if you oppose anything he does. Or you’re completely insane and therefore the government should monitor you, investigate you, have a secret file on you, then arrest you if it can. That’s their program.

AJ: Did you see the comments in the article where they say we need to be killed? Have you seen that yet?

SR: No I have not. Last night I was on Alan Colmes’s show, which was a really horrible interview, all he wanted to do was accuse me of being [garbled] and paranoid. But he had comments on his site that were pretty atrocious too.

AJ: (0:02:57.6) The Louisville newspapers and the AP are reporting, I’m gonna dig them out and cover them coming up as soon as I find them. Congressman Brown is saying this is being used for martial law, that Congress has been threatened with martial law. We have now the Pentagon publicly saying they want to deploy 400k regular Army on the streets of America. This is an occupation rivaling Baghdad. This is really happening.

SR: Yeah. The flu idea, that has always been the one thing people throw back at us about our 10 orders, they say what about a pandemic. So I can’t think of a stronger pretext, short of a nuke going off in an American city, for trying to declare martial law. But as you know, martial law has no constitutional basis whatsoever. I get sick and tired of all these politicians throwing around this word martial law. They have no idea what they’re talking about. Martial law is the absolute absence of law. It’s the will of the commander on the battlefield. Nowhere in our Constitution is there an escape clause that says when the weather’s bad you can suspend 2A like they did in Katrina, or if there’s a flu outbreak you can suspend the Constitution and declare martial law. Doesn’t exist. When you look at Article 4 Section 4, that’s your answer right there. What’s it say? It says the national government shall secure to the states a republican form of government and shall protect each of them against invasion and on application of the legislature or of the executive when the legislature cannot be convened, against domestic violence. It’s saying there that you have to have the permission of the legislature of a state, or only if a legislature cannot be convened, the governor of the state, only then can the federal government come into a state. That’s my first stop when it comes to the constitutionality of any of these plans, NORTHCOM, FEMA, DHS. They’re acting as though the states don’t exist anymore.

AJ: (0:04:56.7) The issue too is, everything should be set up around the state responding. The locals can always spend the money the best and they can respond the best. That’s the way we’ve always operated.

SR: It’s not even that.

AJ: If Congress can’t even read its own bills, and look at Katrina, how is it going to respond? No they’re going to use disasters as a pretext to come in and confiscate guns and loot wealthy houses, as happened in Katrina. Stay there, SR with OK, thousands and thousands of military and police taking the oath to not violate the Bill of Rights and Constitution and to upkeep their oath. We’ll be right back.

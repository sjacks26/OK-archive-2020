<content:encoded>Hey!  If the Liberty Movement gets treated like ISIS, does that mean it can be armed and funded by the feds too?

<content:encoded>I agree Brandon the groundwork is being laid out to make the round up of leadership and key personnel in the liberty movement.  The totalitarians have chosen to use violent Jihad to create a Hegelian dialectic in order to solidify their police state and compel the people to conform and comply with their edicts, no matter how un-constitutional or depraved that they may be.  They are using the Muslim Caliphate to be the boot on the face of the human race forever for their New World Order and doing a good job of it too.  We are being painted into a box because our enemies know that we are the only ones in the world that will or can stand up to them and defeat them whether it is in the arena of ideas or in the arena of physical battle.
<p>With that said, I would like to reiterate what I have written in the comments section of a couple of other articles here on Oath Keepers.  The important need for Oath Keepers and other organizations of the Liberty Movement to have a dedicated and authorized Public Information Officer (PIO).</p>
<p>We are still at a level of discourse in this country that is still peaceful.  Frankly we are way behind the information curve and our enemies such as the SPLC, DHS and other agencies that are to numerous to list here are far in advance than we are and they know it.</p>
<p>We need better public relations and that will take professional information relaying from a single source not a cacophony of voices that may or may not be one of the good guys if you know what I mean (I’m thinking of COINTEL PRO).  </p>
<p>A real strong PIO could get out in front of situations and sanctioned events with a legitimate and well thought out answers to questions about our motives and mission before the enemy gets their word out demonizing our organizations intent and our membership.</p>
<p>Basically, we must start to think more proactive instead of reactive and win the hearts and minds of the public.  I believe that the window to do this with a PIO is very close to closing down forever. </p>
<p>If we do not shape the battle space of the information war more effectively then we will ultimately fall to the machinations of the enemies within quickly and fatally.  Our cause will fail to gain traction publicly and peacefully and drift away to the shadows of history.  </p>
<p>We will have no other recourse but to ruck up and if you have ever had to do this in life it is definitely not what any sane person would want to resort to.</p>
<p>So use your influence to convince the leadership of the various organizations that you associate with in the Liberty Movement to implement the very important position of PIO before the need for one has passed us by and we are relegated to the same designation as ISIS.  </p>
<p>By then it won’t matter though, because the target rich environment will be in full swing right?</p>

In a word, yes. (LAUSD website)</p></div>
<p>An email threat resulting in the closure of all Los Angeles Unified School District schools was apparently a hoax, <strong><a href="http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-all-lausd-schools-closed-threat-20151215-story.html" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-all-lausd-schools-closed-threat-20151215-story.html', 'The Los Angeles Times is reporting');" target="_blank">The Los Angeles Times is reporting</a></strong>. Even had it not been, the incident illustrates how government infringing on rights does nothing but deprive Americans of freedom, and that the promised security in exchange for forced sacrifice is the most damaging fraud of all.</p>
<p>“The email mentioned explosive devices, assault rifles and pistols and was traced to an IP address in Frankfurt, Germany, according to law enforcement sources,” the report elaborates. That gives us some clues at least.</p>
<p>We know it wasn’t by any of the  hated “homegrown extremists” (like Oath Keepers!) the government would like everyone to believe poses the real terror threat. And noting Chancellor Angela Merkel’s affinity for culturally terraforming her homeland in a way Allied and Soviet bombing, invasion and occupation could not, there’s a chance the perp was one of those jihadists government “leaders” in the West all seem determined to welcome in and then lose track of.</p>
<p>Still, say the threat had been domestic and real – what then?  How does forcing Americans to surrender their right to due process and their right to keep and bear arms to a secret ‘terror watchlist” make anyone any safer?  If the government knows they’re a danger, charge them and hold a trial, with a presumption of innocence and the burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt on the state.  And if they’re foreign terror suspects, how does allowing them to remain here and move freely among us help “secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity”?</p>
<p>In fact, there’s good reason to believe the whole point of that move is simply to provide another inroad for citizen disarmament, with those whose goal is to uphold fidelity to the Constitution and restore adherence to the chains of delegated powers libeled as “anti-government extremists.” <strong><a href="http://www.ammoland.com/2015/12/so-called-terror-watchlist-gun-ban-poses-greatest-danger-of-any-current-proposal/" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.ammoland.com/2015/12/so-called-terror-watchlist-gun-ban-poses-greatest-danger-of-any-current-proposal/', 'The point is to disarm patriots');" target="_blank">The point is to disarm patriots</a></strong>, and not just by creating a “no buy” list, but by following that up with confiscations.</p>
<p>A truism I use regularly is that with “progressives,” every day is Opposite Day. Orwell described it as “War is Peace, Freedom is Slavery, Ignorance is Strength,” and such lies are the foundation of every totalitarian regime.  Maintaining the lies requires demonizing and thus dehumanizing those who are deemed an inconvenience to the planned order of things, those who must be eliminated. So naturally, the “solution” of importing millions from cultures inimical and even fanatically hostile to ours, ramping up the police state and maintaining increased levels of citizen disarmament along with more “gun free zones” is the mandate imposed. And anyone who objects is derided as a throwback, a racist, a coward who needs guns to make up for masculine shortcomings, a lunatic and a threat.</p>
<p>What was the solution offered by the Founders? Government limited to delegated powers. All exercise of those powers must advance the very reasons those powers were delegated in the first place: “[T]o form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defence, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity.”</p>
<p>And as for what was needed when the Republic came under attack, they were pretty specific there, too.</p>
<p>How would that stop a hostile phone call coming in from Germany?</p>
<p>No system devised by man will ever be perfect. But security and freedom need not be mutually exclusive. Were the Founders’ vision the norm, schools and all places in the U.S. would be safer. It would be a freer place, with attendant accountability of those who make it less so, the criminals both in and out of government.</p>
<p>And as for the rest of the world?  Freedom produces a powerful example to emulate, and powerful incentives to do so. And again the wisdom of the Founders proves timeless and true.</p>
<p>“It is our true policy to steer clear of permanent alliance with any portion of the foreign world”: George Washington proclaimed in his Farewell Address.</p>
<p>“Peace, commerce, and honest friendship with all nations-entangling alliances with none,” Thomas Jefferson echoed in his inaugural address.</p>
<p>We can see the miserable, freedom-destroying results of our “leaders” doing the opposite.  Anybody feel safer as a result?</p>

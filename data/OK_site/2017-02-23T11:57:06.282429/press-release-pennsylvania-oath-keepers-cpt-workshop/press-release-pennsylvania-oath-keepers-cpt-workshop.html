<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>PRESS RELEASE:</strong></p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>PA OATH KEEPERS CPT WORKSHOP</strong></h2>
<p> </p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>by Andy Pannafino</strong></em></p>
<p>On Tuesday February 10, 2015, the Berks Chapter of Oath Keepers hosted a PA State workshop on the topic of CPT; Community Preparedness Teams. The event was held at the GNA Restaurant in West Reading,Pa.</p>
<p>.<br/>
The scheduled feature speaker was Mr. Stewart Rhodes, founder and director of Oath Keepers National. Unfortunately, due to a family emergency, Stewart was unable to appear. Filling in at the last minute were Mr. Roger Mullins and Mr. David Laverty. ( A true example of how Oath Keepers cover each others backs; “People helping People”)</p>
<p> </p>
<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_5151" style="width: 654px"><a href="../wp-content/uploads/2015/02/PA_CPT_2015.jpg"><img alt="Pictured from L-R are Mr. David Laverty (Oath Keepers PA CPT Leader), Mr. Andy Pannafino (Berks County POC and Chapter Organizer) , Mr. Roger Mullins (Bucks County CPT)" class=" wp-image-5151" height="483" src="../wp-content/uploads/2015/02/PA_CPT_2015.jpg" width="644"/></a><p class="wp-caption-text"><em><strong>Pictured from L-R are Mr. David Laverty (Oath Keepers PA CPT Leader),</strong></em><br/><em><strong>Mr. Andy Pannafino (Berks County POC and Chapter Organizer) , Mr. Roger</strong></em><br/><em><strong>Mullins (Bucks County CPT)</strong></em></p></div>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>The evening began</strong> with a welcome by Mr. Pannafino. Immediately following was a prayer led by Mr. Jim Smith (Smith Law Group). Following the prayer was the presenting of the colors and leading of the Pledge of Allegiance by two cadets from the Wilson West Lawn High School Army ROTC. They were under the direction of Sr. Army Instructor Col. Wendell L. May.</p>
<p>.<br/>
In attendance was our Berks County Sheriff Eric J. Weaknecht. Also present were several members of the Bucks and Perry County CPT programs, as well as Berks County co-organizer Charles Gilbert and CPT leader Kevin McTish.</p>
<p>.<br/>
Kicking off the workshop was Mr. Roger Mullins. He is a key member of the Bucks County CPT, which is probably one of the best programs of its type in the country!</p>
<p>.<br/>
Roger presented a power point program educating the audience about the Community Preparedness Team program. He emphasized the image that Oath Keepers represent in helping the public survive an emergency, both natural and man-made, working along with law enforcement and EMT units. He closed with sharing his first hand experience as a volunteer (“boots on the ground”) traveling to Ferguson, Missouri to assist the public in protecting their stores and property. The crowd of over 60 found this very informative.</p>
<p>.<br/>
Following Roger was Mr. David Laverty. Dave serves as the PA State Leader of CPT for Oath Keepers. He is also the President and founder of Stay Ready, Inc. As a former US Army Infantryman Dave, for the past 30 years, has helped people prepare for extreme conditions and how to survive the elements. He is currently a PA State Constable.</p>
<p>.<br/>
Dave followed up on Roger’s presentation with more about the need for the a CPT program.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>The closing presenter was Mr. Patton Laverty. Patton is vice president and co-founder of Stay Ready. He is a certified NRA firearms instructor. He is a hand-to-hand combat instructor as well as a HAM radio operator. He is also the primary consultant for Stay Ready on medical equipment, bug out bags and tactical gear.</p>
<p>.<br/>
Patton presented a demo on the contents of a Trauma Bag and their purpose. The evening was most educational and most of the audience stayed around to mingle with the presenters.</p>

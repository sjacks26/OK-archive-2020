<content:encoded>Always copy and paste the terms and conditions and put them in a word document and then search on different criteria and you will see what they are hiding. Example search on $ and you will see if they have automatic charges that they will charge your account.

<content:encoded>You got to remember something – when you turn on automatic updates – Microsoft downloads tons of software to make sure that they control  your computer – that is why there are so many patch updates. Every time they release a new patch it comes with malware (viruses, worms, trojans, etc…), malicious code, etc… they got to make you think that third world hackers are hacking your computer so they can sell you security software (fireall, IDS/IPS, anti virus, spam ware etc….) its a money maker for Microsoft and other companies like them. Its all a scam to make you beleive that they are security experts and that they are providing you with a services that you really dont need.

<content:encoded>Its better to go with Apple or MAC if you want privacy. If you need something else then its better to wipe the OS from the computer and install either UNIX or Linux OS and then lock it down with security tools. Windows is  for people that do not understand computers – its idiot proof for most

<content:encoded>Its the same as Windows 8, except now they installed spyware to monitor everything you do and say – they can turn on your cam and mic and listen to and watch you. They can even track where you go and whom you are associating with and more……………..

<content:encoded>That is NOT a true statement son, the government has the key to decrypt all encryption programs made and used in the USA. It is mandatory, because they are afraid that someone is going to develop something that they cant crack and then they will cry because they cannot learn your secrets. Beside Microsoft is in bed with the government and they have installed technologies that you wouldn’t understand that allows them to get into your computer regardless of the encryption. So encrypting or decrypting data doesn’t matter.

<p class="CSSRed">Thomas Sargent, the New York University professor who was announced Monday as a winner of the Nobel in economics … cites Walter Bagehot, who “said that what he called <strong>a ‘natural’ competitive banking system without a ‘central’ bank would be better…. ‘nothing can be more surely established by a larger experience than that a Government which interferes with any trade injures that trade. The best thing undeniably that a Government can do with the Money Market is to let it take care of itself</strong>.’”</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="CSSBody">Earlier U.S. central banks caused mischief, as well.  For example,  Austrian economist Murray Rothbard <a href="http://mises.org/article.aspx?Id=1423" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://mises.org/article.aspx?Id=1423', 'wrote');">wrote</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="CSSRed">The panics of 1837 and 1839 … were the consequence of a massive inflationary boom fueled by the Whig-run Second Bank of the United States.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="CSSBody">Indeed, the Revolutionary War was largely due to the actions of the world’s first central bank, the Bank of England.   Specifically, when Benjamin Franklin went to London in 1764, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Web-Debt-Shocking-Sleight-Trapped/dp/0979560802" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.amazon.com/Web-Debt-Shocking-Sleight-Trapped/dp/0979560802', 'this is what he observed');">this is what he observed</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="CSSRed">When he arrived, he was surprised to find rampant unemployment and poverty among the British working classes… Franklin was then asked how the American colonies managed to collect enough money to support their poor houses. He reportedly replied:</p>
<p class="CSSRed">“We have no poor houses in the Colonies; and if we had some, there would be nobody to put in them, since there is, in the Colonies, not a single unemployed person, neither beggars nor tramps.”</p>
<p class="CSSRed">In 1764, the Bank of England used its influence on Parliament to get a Currency Act passed that made it illegal for any of the colonies to print their own money. The colonists were forced to pay all future taxes to Britain in silver or gold. Anyone lacking in those precious metals had to borrow them at interest from the banks.</p>
<p class="CSSRed">Only a year later, Franklin said, the streets of the colonies were filled with unemployed beggars, just as they were in England. The money supply had suddenly been reduced by half, leaving insufficient funds to pay for the goods and services these workers could have provided. He maintained that it was “the poverty caused by the bad influence of the English bankers on the Parliament which has caused in the colonies hatred of the English and . . . the Revolutionary War.” This, he said, was the real reason for the Revolution: “the colonies would gladly have borne the little tax on tea and other matters had it not been that England took away from the colonies their money, which created unemployment and dissatisfaction.”</p>

<p class="CSSBody">And things are getting <em>worse</em> … rather than better.  As Professor Werner tells Washington’s Blog:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="CSSRed">Central banks have legally become more and more powerful in the past 30 years across the globe, yet they have become de facto less and less accountable. In fact, as I warned in my book New Paradigm in Macroeconomics in 2005, after each of the ‘recurring banking crises’, central banks are usually handed even more powers. This also happened after the 2008 crisis. [Background <a href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2009/06/dodd-giving-the-fed-more-power-is-like-awarding-a-son-a-%E2%80%9Cbigger-faster-car-right-after-he-crashed-the-family-station-wagon.html" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2009/06/dodd-giving-the-fed-more-power-is-like-awarding-a-son-a-%E2%80%9Cbigger-faster-car-right-after-he-crashed-the-family-station-wagon.html', 'here');">here</a> and <a href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2009/10/should-we-give-the-fed-more-power-or-less.html" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2009/10/should-we-give-the-fed-more-power-or-less.html', 'here');">here</a>.] So it is clear we have a regulatory moral hazard problem: central banks seem to benefit from crises. No wonder the rise of central banks to ever larger legal powers has been accompanied not by fewer and smaller business cycles and crises, but more crises and of larger amplitude.</p>

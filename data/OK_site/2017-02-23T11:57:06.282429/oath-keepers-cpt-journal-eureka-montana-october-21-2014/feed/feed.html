<content:encoded>I want everyone of you Oath Keepers to know that I admire and appreciate your loyalty to your fellow Americans…I wish I was a young person so that I could do more to help. All I can do now is share all the information and the link to your website with as many people as I can. I am praying for you all. God bless you, and keep a stout heart because the enemy is at the door.

<content:encoded>I agree with Mr. Pitsker’s comments regarding this being a possible prelude to martial law or perhaps even forced vaccinations. For starters, I would suggest looking at the Seven Step Ebola Response Plan that Parents Against Mandatory Vaccinations has developed: <a href="http://parentsagainstmandatoryvaccines.wikispaces.com/Seven+Step+Ebola+Response+Plan" rel="nofollow">http://parentsagainstmandatoryvaccines.wikispaces.com/Seven+Step+Ebola+Response+Plan</a>
<p>Secondly, the alternative news site Veteran’s Today has been publishing a lot of first rate coverage on this “Ebo-LIE” frenzy (for example <a href="http://www.veteranstoday.com/2014/10/15/vt-issues-first-ebola-warning/" rel="nofollow">http://www.veteranstoday.com/2014/10/15/vt-issues-first-ebola-warning/</a>).  In my view, “Fear-bola” is just another in a long line of the secret shadow government’s false flag attacks (e.g. Sandy Hook, Boston Marathon bombing and of course 9/11) to isolate any American who sees through their psyops, wants to do something positive to defend himself and his community (like Oath Keepers are obviously trying to do), and is then framed in their corporate media as an extremist. However, we must not dismiss the possibility that this psyop could have deadly consequences nonetheless.</p>
<p>Think of the power these psychopaths could wield quarantining whole communities, or curtailing civil liberties and increasing surveillance and military presence. What if this whole drama is just being manufactured to cover the economic crisis about to result from the demise of the petrodollar? </p>
<p>A psyop like this is a war tactic to gain an advantage, so I conclude this is a war being waged against Americans, and as Oath Keepers know, war is a racket.  The CDC is just another corporation in bed with big Pharma, no doubt salivating over all the increased funding it is going to get if they manage to sucker Americans into buying into their fear porn, while their Big Pharma buddies rake in the profits off the vaccine they are getting ready to roll out.</p>
<p>I think Oath Keepers has the right idea with initiating the Community Preparedness Teams.  We have to start generating some proactive response to this possible threat to our personal liberties.</p>

<content:encoded>For the last week or so, I have been reading one article after the other on Ebola.  And I am still confused as to how worried we all should be.  Some points I have seen written include :<br/>
1)  Selenium pills boost your immune system and many survivors took it.<br/>
2).  Colloidal Silver was also used by survivors.<br/>
3).  Death rate is now about 70%.<br/>
4).  Some claim the new strain is stronger and has a higher viral lode, suggesting it may have been engineered, or       Weaponized.  Google “Has Ebola been weaponized”.<br/>
5).  US troops were sent to Ebola countries for the purpose of testing a new VAX that was given them. This immediately brought to my mind the movie “Beyond Treason”.  Google “Testing Ebola VAX on US Troops”.<br/>
6).  The VAX will contain a RFID chip that will be implanted in each recipient. Google “RFID chip in Ebola VAX”.<br/>
7).   Incubation period may be more than 40 days. Google “incubation period of weaponized Ebola”<br/>
Lots of other stuff I have read, but these are the most important ones stuck in the top of my head right now. Of course there were many articles saying everything is ok, that it’s just another hoax, don’t worry, which would be a better scenario. Whatever, it is clear that little is known about what the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth about this Ebola outbreak.  Forget about what you hear on the mainstream, but stay open to new info. Only time will tell now.  Be ready for anything including having to hunker down and shelter in place.  You can bet that if this is a real threat, the DUMBS will be filling up.
<p>It has been no secret that Satanic sectors of society want to eliminate up to 95% of the current population of 7 billion people. Google “number 1 rule on the Georgia GuideStones”. It has been written in stone since 1980, in 8 different languages just in case you didn’t get the gist of their intent in your first reading.  These people and their “big idea” are no laughing matter. They are serious as a heart attack, and until we root them out and string them up, they will continue to make attempts on our lives.<br/>
They want most of us GONE !!!  Google “Georgia GuideStones” and read a lot if you aren’t familiar with them.</p>

<content:encoded>I read all of your articles with great interest I am a 79 year old retired U.S Army First Sergeant and Vietnam Veteran(disabled). I wish I was younger, so I could be more actively involved. I spent twenty one years in the Military in the Combat Arms. I served as an instructor during most of my CONOS assignments. I can still shoot very well for a guy my age and I know how to teach marksmen the right way. You guys contact me if you have anything for me to do. I work free.

<content:encoded>False flags for what purpose?  Perhaps to take our focus off the big one.  Bank foreclosure fraud on a level unseen in the history of world economics.  It’s a land grab people.  6 million homes so far and millions more in the pipeline,yet not a single word in the main street media.  Can anybody here me?

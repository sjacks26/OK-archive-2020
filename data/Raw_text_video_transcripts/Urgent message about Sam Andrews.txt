SR: This is SR, founder and president of OK. I have on the phone with me Sgt. Major Joseph Santoro, who’s on our national borders of directors and is our national operations officer. Also have John Karriman, who is our Missouri leader, and the point man in Ferguson for our upcoming training of Black citizens in Ferguson, of all citizens in Fergusons. Also, Steve Homan, the national vice president. We’re talking today about Sam Andrews. There are some facts we did not know about him that we just learned, we think are critical for the people of Ferguson and Missouri to know. We had seen some red flags in his behavior, one was during Sugar Pine Mine. JS, describe what happened there with Sam.

JS: About 3 weeks into the operation, Sam came in and went up the hill to assess the situation as he saw it. He started berating a lot of folks up on the hill, really brow beating them down hard. They were very up in arms. Some of them came down, spoke with Joseph Rice and some of the other folks at the logistical camp. It was way out of what anyone thought it should have been, the brow beating. So that raised some red flags for us right away.

SR: In particular, some pretty severe verbal abuse of one of the local volunteer leaders, like you said that was way over the top. So we saw a pattern in his behavior, began to emerge, of verbal intimidation and kind of a narcissistic personality, no one can do it better than him. We saw this again, he verbally berated and tore up my vice president, Steve Homan, after we simply tried to give him some guidance on how to talk to the media. Since then, he has turned on us and is libeling us all over the place, making factually, you know, easily confirmed false statements, like that our entire board is retired police, which is simply not true. We addressed that in another video. All of this raised some serious red flags, we decided we needed to look deeper. Here’s our concern, that he is still planning on leading an armed march of the people of Ferguson, and so things that did not turn up in a background check. In fact, John Karriman, if you can talk about how, we do try our best to vet people, but because of his background and being vetted by the U.S. government, we thought he was good to go. Can you talk about that.

JK: (0:03:04.4) Exactly. When Uncle Sugar puts the seal of approval on somebody who’s making silencers and machine gun parts and various weapons for military and law enforcement organizations, there’s a presumption on our part that they’re good to go. So in addition to a fairly stringent background check, we also trusted our own government to have properly vetted him. 

SR: Right. The background check we ran, a criminal background check, did not disclose anything. But we have since dug a bit deeper, after our concerns with his personality. We have found a custody battle in 2009, findings of act and conclusions of law by Judge Dale Hood in September 2009, which was later upheld and affirmed by the Court of Appeals in Missouri in 2011. Here are, I’m going to read this out, and we’ll also post this. Now when we post this, we’re going to redact some personal information about the ex-wife, the mother of his daughter, and his daughter. It’s not relevant. We’re going to black out some of their personal information and some financial information. None of that is relevant. What’s relevant is the findings of fact and conclusions of law about Sam, whose real name is Louie Samuel Andrews. Here is, in subsection 7 of the findings of fact and conclusions of law, I’ll read it. Alright, in subsection 7, I’ll start here: this court finds overwhelming and compelling evidence that throughout their 12 year marriage, the mother was the victim of repeated and continuous domestic violence by father. The pattern of domestic violence was intense, unrelenting, and repugnant. Mother testified and this court finds that on more than 1 occasion, mother was physically abused by father, including being thrown against the wall, grabbed by the throat, physically restrained, and on at least 1 occasion, mother was physically restrained by father with the assistance of a handgun. Subsection 8: mother’s testimony regarding an incident of abuse in February 2003 is found by this court to be credible. This incident began when father falsely accused mother of having an illicit relationship with a Florida policeman. When mother persisted in denying these accusations, father held a semi-automatic handgun to her head for 2 hours, struck her face with the gun, and threatened to kill her if she told hospital personnel that he was the cause of her injuries. Subsection 9: mother’s testimony about father’s abuse of the family pet Tigger is found to be credible. During the party’s separation in 2003, mother and Jessica were visiting father at the marital residence. When father discovered that Tigger had urinated on the back of a sofa and onto the floor, he became enraged. Father grabbed Tigger by the ears, pulled him away from mother, and repeatedly kicked him while dragging him through the front door, around the side of the house, and into the backyard. Father testified that the child was in the front hallway when he pulled Tigger out of the house. Mother silently witnessed father race into the house and return with the same handgun he had held to her head 2 months earlier. Mother subsequently heard the gun being fired repeatedly by father until such time as Tigger was presumed dead. Mother then grabbed the child and fled the house before father returned. 

SR: (0:06:51.3) Subsection 10: There is overwhelming evidence for the court to find that father is unable to manage his anger and frequently uses threats of physical violence and emotional manipulation to control mother and daughter. Subsection 11: the court heard extensive testimony from Dr. Sharron Lightfoot regarding the mental examinations of mother and father. The court finds the testimony and the resulting mental examinations of both parties extraordinarily credible. Specifically, the court finds that father suffers from a narcissistic personality disorder manifested by a pervasive pattern of grandiosity, need for admiration, lack of empathy, grandiose sense of self-importance, and a constant belief that he is better than others or that he has special powers or abilities. Subsection 12: Dr. Lightfoot testified and this court finds that a person with a narcissistic personality disorder such as exhibited by father responds to disagreements by emotionally squashing his opponent and making her appear to be the cause of the problem. The court finds that father, possessing this type of personality disorder, shows no credible history of a willingness to share control and negotiate agreements with mother regarding the child. That’s the conclusion of the reading of the court’s finding of fact and conclusions of law. This caused us enough concern that we feel honor-bound to notify the people of Ferguson and Missouri of this history of violence and threatened use of violence, and warn them. The point is for us that this confirms what we have witnessed in person in dealing with him, is this absolute refusal to accept any guidance or advice from anybody else, a belief that everyone around him is incompetent, he’s the only competent one, and a use of verbal intimidation and attempt to browbeat people to do what he wants. This is not something we want in our org. Of course, the allegations or revelations of his use of violence and threats of violence is something we had no idea. We feel an obligation to warn the people of Ferguson and Missouri that we think, based on this, that he is potentially mentally unstable and potentially very violent. We don’t want to see the people of Ferguson unwittingly follow this man into an armed march. We also have a duty and obligation to OK and to anybody else who served under his command during the Ferguson operation, we don’t want to see them go back out there bearing arms under his command, given these revelations. And yeah, it’s going to give us a black eye, you can expect our enemies to use it against us. But we think our obligation to warn the community far outweighs that. This is just the right thing to do, we have no choice. Anybody else want to comment on that? John?

JK: (0:09:48.2) We’re operating with a clear conscience. We did our due diligence, our background is more diligent than the one the government uses. Outside of that, these things came up. We’re in the process because of things that came up, actually starting last year as far as some of the attitude, and it just continued to grow. He’s an intelligent man, but instead of using that for good he uses it to promote self. Actually, this whole, the spawning of [garbled] started last year. Boys will talk, he had begun to talk about a specialized group within OK. Of course, that was covered with our CPT training, everybody specializes in something and we cross-train. His desire to do this has been from his inception as a member, I believe. Speaking to the facts, he’s done nothing but sow discord and try to cause distrust amongst the leadership. As long as you’re rank and file, you’re safe. But if he considers you a threat as far as intellect or in the command structure, he’s going to go after you with all his skills and abilities. This is simply our trying to warn the citizens of the St. Louis area that he’s dangerous, he’s not stable.

SR: (0:11:15.7) Right. So what we’re going to do is carry on as we intended. We already covered in our past video that we never withdrew support for an armed march among the good people of Ferguson, and John is still the point man for that. We’re going to go, knock door to door and try to organize the people of Ferguson into neighborhood watches, which is the whole point anyway, not for some special team to guard the community, but for the community to guard themselves, for the people of Ferguson need to stand up and form their own neighborhood watches and take care of business themselves. As I said before, the drive-by shooting of that young 9 year old girl, that tragedy is not on the hands of the police, it’s on the hands of the people of Ferguson for not taking out the trash themselves and letting thugs dominate their neighborhoods. So we take a long term view of going and organizing the folks in Ferguson to take care of their own security. We want them to be the ones to suppress looting, shooting, and arson in their community, so the focus is on their concerns, not on the bad guys and their behavior. John is going to lead that, we’re still going forward with that. We are going to have OK volunteers, Black OK coming in from outside the community to assist in that. The end goal is not some grandiose march with someone walking in the front like they’re Moses or something. The end goal is for the people of Ferguson to stand up, that’s where our focus is going to be is on them, cultivating their own leadership in their community and giving them the limelight. That’s what we want to see happen and we want to see it done in a safe and sane way. We just have to warn folks, we think it would be extremely bad idea for you to involve Sam Andrews, real name Louis Andrews, in what you’re doing in Ferguson. You have the right to do your own open carry. Do it yourselves, you don’t need somebody else to be your Moses. Do it yourselves. Anything else guys?

JS: (0:13:24.5) I believe it’s time that the people of Ferguson get a hand up instead of a hand out. What OK are trying to do is give them that hand up so they can take over and protect their own businesses and their own families and communities. This is our whole objective here. We want to have a nonviolent ending to this, as much as can be had. They’ve allowed folks to come in from outside their city and state and rabble rousers that do nothing but burn and loot. It’s now time to empower these people so they have a feeling that they are worthwhile and their lives do matter.

SR: Amen. John, you wanted to say something?

JK: (0:14:14.4) Just to make our brothers and sisters out there aware that this idea of bleeding membership because of some kind of racial prejudice on the part of our organization is a joke. There’s no space in our membership application for race, because it’s not what’s important. We’re in it for our country and our countrymen, and that’s why we stepped up at these various places in the country, because we do care. For there to be any kind of allegation that race is a factor is patently false. 

SR: Exactly. In fact, it’s kind of ironic, now that I’m going to go out and appeal to our black OK. I have to ask them to self-identify, because there’s not box in membership, no checkbox for race. We don’t care what color somebody is. To find these guys, I gotta go out and ask our membership, if you’re a black OK, let us know and if you’re willing to go to Ferguson to go door to door, let us know. We do think there is some very valid concerns that a young black man with a rifle would be treated differently than a young white man with a rifle. That’s the whole point of us doing an open carry event, which we agreed to. The only problem we have is with Sam. His egomania went out of control and he wouldn’t take our guidance. That’s what happened. We never withdrew our support, we still support the people of Ferguson and their right to open carry and their right to take care of their own neighborhoods, which is in line with what we’re doing across the country. That’s the whole point of our CPT program, for every American to take responsibility for their own security and the security of their fellow Americans in their neighborhoods. We want to see CPT teams or neighborhood watches all across the country. There are still more good guys than bad. I will say that after this, we are going to be paying even more attention and do even more vetting of anybody that’s put in a position of authority and leadership in OK. We see it, narcissistic personalities and sociopathic personalities desire power. And we see that in government, that’s one of the main problems with government is that’s who seeks out that power, folks that love to control other people. We see that, John, you see that in police services, right? That’s who tends to gravitate towards police services are guys that have huge egos and like power.

JK: (0:16:38.4) We do. It’s an unfortunate part of the process. Law enforcement draws bullies and cowards. They gravitate towards higher and higher positions and surround themselves with more of the same. How pervasive it is depends on the community and they’re putting up with it for any degree of time.

SR: The same is going to happen in an organization like ours made up of current serving and former military and police and first responders. You’re going to get guys like that and they’re going to seek power, they’re going to seek leadership. It’s going to be our obligation and duty to locate them and run them out. If we find anybody else that likes to verbally berate people and abuse their power, they’re going to be shown the door. We’re going to do a purge of our own ranks to be sure we’re putting stable people and people that have the right heart of service in positions of leadership, getting a sword. Just know that folks.

<p class="CSSBody">You have to love how the Federal Reserve downplays   inflation when they are the primary source of it with other central   bankers for this <a href="http://www.mybudget360.com/cost-of-living-1938-to-2013-inflation-history-cost-of-goods-inflation/" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.mybudget360.com/cost-of-living-1938-to-2013-inflation-history-cost-of-goods-inflation/', 'monetary phenomenon');">monetary phenomenon</a>.   They continue to play inflation down because it gives them the power  to  continue to use policies that seem to only aid their banking allies   while making working Americans poorer by the day. <a href="http://www.mybudget360.com/cost-of-living-1938-to-2013-inflation-history-cost-of-goods-inflation/" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.mybudget360.com/cost-of-living-1938-to-2013-inflation-history-cost-of-goods-inflation/', 'Inflation has a slow eroding power');">Inflation has a slow eroding power</a> that is not readily visible since it usually takes time to work through   a system. Looking at a broader timeframe however it becomes readily   apparent that inflation is hitting our system hard and most working   families don’t need an advanced degree in economics to understand this.</p>
<p class="CSSBody">According to the CPI, the overall rate of  inflation  since January of 2000 has been 39 percent. The Fed prefers to  use the  PCE Deflator measure and this only has inflation running at a 31   percent rate. But when we actually look at the cost of goods and   services across the spending spectrum we realize that inflation is very   much alive and well with us.</p>
<p class="CSSTopic"><strong>Examining the cost of goods and services since 2000</strong></p>
<p class="CSSBody">Americans eat, pay mortgages/rent, and tend  to drive  a lot. We also have the aspiration of sending our kids to  college for a  better and more educated life. When sick, we want to have  access to  healthcare. All of these services and goods are much more  expensive  since 2000. Inflation is very much alive when we look at the  cost of  goods and services.</p>
<p class="CSSBody">Take a look at some major spending categories since January of 2000:</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.mybudget360.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/costoflivingxpenses-7-1-14.jpg" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.mybudget360.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/costoflivingxpenses-7-1-14.jpg', '');" target="_blank" title="costoflivingxpenses-7-1-14"><img alt="costoflivingxpenses-7-1-14" border="0" class="alignnone wp-image-5704" height="409" src="https://www.silverbearcafe.com/private/07.14/images/costoflivingxpenses.jpg" width="498"/></a></strong></p>
<p class="CSSBody">A gallon of gas is up 176 percent since 2000.  Ground  beef is up 96 percent. Your typical college tuition is up 68  percent. A  new car will now cost you 55 percent more than it would have  in 2000.  Your average home is now up 50 percent even though we went  through the  biggest housing bubble our nation has faced (largely driven  by cheap  and <a href="http://www.mybudget360.com/inflation-noise-fed-inflation-targets/" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.mybudget360.com/inflation-noise-fed-inflation-targets/', 'dangerous banking policy');">dangerous banking policy</a>).   Yet the overall CPI is only registering a 39 percent increase. The Fed   looks at the PCE Deflator and this is only up 31 percent. So it is no   surprise why the Fed has aggressively ramped up monetary policy. Don’t   think so? Look at the current monetary base:</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.mybudget360.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/monetary-base.png" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.mybudget360.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/monetary-base.png', '');" target="_blank" title="monetary base"><img alt="monetary base" border="0" class="alignnone wp-image-5705" height="266" src="https://www.silverbearcafe.com/private/07.14/images/monetary-base.jpg" width="496"/></a></strong></p>
<p class="CSSBody">The jump from $800 billion to over $4  trillion is  largely driven by large commercial banks offloading debt  instruments to  the Fed. This has done very little in helping the balance  sheet of  Americans but has essentially been a shadow bailout for the  beleaguered  banking sector.</p>
<p class="CSSBody">The primary reason Americans feel poorer is that wages are simply not keeping up:</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.mybudget360.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/median-household-income.png" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.mybudget360.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/median-household-income.png', '');" target="_blank" title="median household income"><img alt="median household income" border="0" class="alignnone wp-image-5706" height="357" src="https://www.silverbearcafe.com/private/07.14/images/median-household-income.jpg" width="497"/></a></strong></p>
<p class="CSSBody">The CPI is up 39 percent while nominal wages  are up  30 percent. The blue line is the most important above. That is,  wages  are not keeping up with the increase in the cost of goods and  services  and this is by the more conservative CPI measure. If you look  at the  Case Shiller housing measure, you will see your typical house is  now 50  percent more expensive and this is the biggest expense for  Americas.  Your new car is up 55 percent in cost since 2000. College  tuition is up  68 percent or nearly twice the rate of wage growth.  Healthcare  spending per capita is up 104 percent so there is no way wage  growth is  keeping up with this.</p>
<p class="CSSBody">That is the insidious problem with inflation.  Some  might think that with meager wage growth that somehow they are  keeping  up. But the Fed has flooded the system with access to debt and  this  debt has largely benefitted big banks. Big investors are now using   cheap debt since they are the people creating access to debt instruments   (i.e., mortgages, auto loans, credit card debt) and would rather use   the money on buying up real assets instead of lending these out to   Americans. For example, since the housing bubble burst a large part of   single family home buying has come from investors. This has driven up   prices for no other reason that investors have easy access to debt   created by loose monetary policy. Little benefit is derived from the   public outside of more money being spent on <a href="http://www.mybudget360.com/generation-r-millennials-homeownership-young-americans-buying-incomes/" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.mybudget360.com/generation-r-millennials-homeownership-young-americans-buying-incomes/', 'housing with weaker wages.');">housing with weaker wages.</a></p>
<p class="CSSBody">Those that lived through the 1970s will tell  you  that inflation without real growth is problematic for an economy.  Yet  we have a generation that has seemed to have forgotten history. What  is  more problematic this time is that wage inflation is simply not to  be  had. So Americans again are forced to go into massive debt to  purchase  homes, buy cars, or simply to send their kids to college. This  is why  we now have $1.2 trillion in student debt while many young  graduates  are unable to service their debt because wages are coming from  the  growing <a href="http://www.mybudget360.com/generation-r-millennials-homeownership-young-americans-buying-incomes/" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.mybudget360.com/generation-r-millennials-homeownership-young-americans-buying-incomes/', 'low wage service sector');">low wage service sector</a>.</p>
<p class="CSSBody">When you hear that inflation does not exist,  simply  look at the price of goods and services over the last decade and  look  at your paycheck. You might care to differ.</p>

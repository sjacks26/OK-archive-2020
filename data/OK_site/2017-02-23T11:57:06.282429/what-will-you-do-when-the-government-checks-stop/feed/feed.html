<content:encoded>“I would tend to agree with Chester. If your using Charcoal in a stove that vents outside I think you should be fine. You shouldn’t use charcoal in a BBQ grill as a tent heater though. MY 2cents”

<content:encoded>Concerning the wood stove thing. No need for a judge and jury. Common sense would suggest that management could get us together although they seem sidetracked with unnecessary comments. Sorry I brought up the whole idea. You tube will educate you as it helped me also. Good Luck!

<content:encoded>you can actually convert the 12-24 volt DC current of solar panels into A/C current with an, or several, inverters,  and run 120 volt appliances off of it, you can even build your own solar panels for pretty damn cheap, ( find minor  blemished panels for 99c for 2 watt cells on ebay) then all you have to do is tab and buss them, and hook up some wires.  you can even use them as mirrors if you want, to help concentrate light onto an area you otherwise couldn’t use for growing things, like vegetables, by reflection.

<content:encoded>It’s not a function of fear. It’s a function of being strong and prepared. It’s being vigilant, not having our heads up our ass. Have a nice day.
<p>MOLON ABE</p>

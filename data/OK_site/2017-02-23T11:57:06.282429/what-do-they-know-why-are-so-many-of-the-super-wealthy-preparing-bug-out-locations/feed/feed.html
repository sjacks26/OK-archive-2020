<content:encoded>Typical reaction… to give others who are in need, is something good. To keep it is something worse. To invest on destroying and life-useless-issues is terrifying.<br/>
Its sayd that just around 1% of the top rules over around 50% of the total of all money.<br/>
Why do those men at the top need to have more money than an average human?<br/>
Where do they use it for?<br/>
To build their own private bunkers? 
<p>When the ”top” would share or give more, the ”lower class” would have more and wouldnt make troubles if they could pay their insurance or their meals.</p>

<content:encoded>Climate fraud, spread the wealth, and increased grave robbing of personal accomplishment? Really?  Gosh, does this not ring some bells?  Nice try.  Nothing beats the protection of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.  Follow this and we prosper.  Lose our way by following this charletan and we end up on the road to what we have today.

<content:encoded>I wonder, as the super wealthy(not all), decide to crawl back under the rocks from which they came, will this choice back fire on the super wealthy in that they are also the group in pursuit of Fracking, which I believe poses a serious threat to all the underground of our earth.  Does not any rock eventually shatter after being exposed to relentless and destructive internal explosions?.  An if WE want in, no matter how far they go, WE will get in….WE the PEOPLE do not scare or quit easily….   And just a thought, but if We chose to sit and pray, as opposed to, get up and act, WE are all doomed…for without Solidarity from the majority, a Lamb is just a Lamb..

<content:encoded>And they say to the mountains and to the rocks, Fall on us and hide us from the face of Him who sits upon the throne and from the wrath of the Lamb;For the great day of Their wrath has come, and who is able to stand? Rev. 6,16&amp;17. You should read this Book.And then read Revelation Chapter 18. This is the future.

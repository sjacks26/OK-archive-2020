<p>Testimonial:  I joined the Army in 1991 as a Private. I was blessed and six years later, I earned a commission. At that point I had taken the enlisted oath twice and the officer oath once. It meant alot, but I really didn’t appreciate that oath. I didn’t really know the real impact of that oath until I saw some things in Baghdad.</p>
<p>I met a young Iraqi with German ancestry. Because of his German ancestry, every time Saddam had a conflict with the West, this guy would get picked up and “questioned” for a few weeks. He was thankful, because no one ever knew his Grandmother had lived in Phoenix for several years. Had Saddam’s people known this, this young man was sure he would’ve been dead.</p>
<p>I met a man about my age. He lived in a mud brick village East of Baghdad, and sold sodas and cigarettes for a living. When we arrived, he took my hand and kept shaking it. Tears streamed down his face as he thanked us for coming. “Saddam is no problem!” he kept shouting. He tried to give his wares away, but I wouldn’t allow my soldiers to take free stuff. This village was Shia, and Saddam’s folks kept them under their boot for no more reason than that. He and his family shared his one room home with his livestock. Forget the WMD stuff. That may be a lie, but the look in this man’s eye, told me that my troopers made a difference here.</p>
<p>In Baghdad was a huge landfill. I noticed some mud huts and people running around in the landfill. I was told by a terp that they lived there. They had fallen out of favor with Saddam’s government, so they were forced to move to the landfill.  They got their food from there. Their life was a life of filth and waste.</p>
<p>All of this was not from a man, Saddam, but from a government. A government that would allow a personality to take over. A personality that determined the law, instead of the rule of law, determined by the will of the people.</p>
<p>I will not allow this to happen in my country. To those that think it won’t, please look up the coal wars in Kentucky and West Virginia, specifically Blair Mountain.  Look up the Battle of Athens. See how it takes the courage of the citizenry to enforce the rule of law, and the Constitution.</p>
<p>As long as there is breath in my lungs, I will live by my oath, to support and<br/>
defend the Constitution of the United States, against all enemies, foreign and<br/>
domestic. That I took this obligation freely, without any mental reservation or<br/>
purpose of evasion. I have well and faithfully discharged the duties of the office in which I entered. With the help of God.</p>

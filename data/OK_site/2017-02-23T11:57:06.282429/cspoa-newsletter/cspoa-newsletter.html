<p><strong>Idaho sheriff prevents the VA from confiscating guns</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The CSPOA applauds the courageous defense of our Constitution by Idaho State Representative Heather Scott and Bonner County Sheriff Daryl Wheeler, in defending the Second Amendment Rights of a local citizen. The citizen in question is veteran John Arnold, who was told he could no longer own a gun by the VA, because he suffered a mild stroke.</p>
<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_7792" style="width: 260px"><a href="https://www.oathkeepers.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Sheriff-Wheeler.jpg"><img alt="Sheriff Wheeler" class="size-full wp-image-7792" height="311" src="https://www.oathkeepers.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Sheriff-Wheeler.jpg" width="250"/></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Sheriff Wheeler</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Sheriff Wheeler and Rep. Scott both interposed on Arnold’s behalf to defend Arnold’s rights as an American, an American who served honorably in the U S Military! Sheriff Wheeler said that he would not allow Arnold’s rights to be violated because he had “taken and oath to uphold and defend the Constitution.”</p>
<p>Sheriff Wheeler proves once again that the CSPOA is having an impact on the preservation of American ideals all across this great land! Before the Oath Keeper and Constitutional Sheriff movement, you never heard of sheriffs and public servants ever mentioning such principled stands for freedom. Now, they are becoming a matter of routine as sheriffs perform their duties in accordance with their oaths of office.</p>
<p>I ask every American and every public official to seriously contemplate what would happen if we had hundreds more sheriffs and local leaders standing as Rep. Scott and Sheriff Wheeler have done in Idaho. It is precisely the manner by which we take America back! CSPOA takes our hats off to Sheriff Wheeler and Representative Scott.</p>

<p><strong>Center for Western Priorities: Don’t be fooled by the innocuous name</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A new ‘group’ has arisen out of nowhere to publish a ‘report’ on the ‘protection’ of ‘public lands.’ Yes, that’s a lot of air quotes. Now, normally we try not to give these types of liberal environmentalist groups any more publicity than they deserve, but we talked about it and came up with a few good reasons why we feel the need to make an exception here. First of all, they’re specifically targeting Utah State Representative Ken Ivory, a signer of the CSPOA declaration and a long-time friend to our cause. Secondly, this is probably not the last we’ll hear from them. So let’s break down those air quotes:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">‘group’ = The web site itself does not say who they are. Our inside info says it’s funded by a couple billionaires who have set out to prevent the western states from regaining control of their own lands obtained illegally by the feds. A little internet digging revealed that Jennifer Rokala, the former state director for U.S. Sen. Mark Udall (Mr. Socialist himself), was named executive director of The Center for Western Priorities in April. Their policy director is Gregory Zimmerman, who was previously involved with The Yale School of Forestry and Environmental Studies and The Nature Conservancy. All environmentalist, all the time.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>‘public lands</strong>‘ = Lands seized by the fed, and therefore no longer controlled by the public.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">‘protection’ = Federal control of. Now, we’ve said it before and we’ll say it again; It doesn’t really matter how noble their cause sounds (protecting the environment, protecting the children, public education, fixing the economy, the war on drugs, etc). If your method of achieving that goal is to trample the Constitution, withhold freedom or property from the people, make puppets of local governments by tricking them into dependency on federal funds, or anything else that pulls more power into Washington DC, we cannot stand for it. We cannot allow it, because in the end it’s not about any of those noble causes. It’s about control.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>‘report’</strong> = A very slick, multi-page document with lots of infographics all aimed at painting Representative Ken Ivory as someone who apparently hates the Earth, as evidenced by his desire to return land currently controlled by the feds back to the states, whom they seem to think are incapable of doing anything but destroying it. The document quotes heavily from the (equally innocuous-sounding) Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) in its attempts to discredit Ken Ivory by pointing out his association with supposed ‘patriot,’ ‘radical’ and ‘racist’ groups. It actually ends up sounding a lot like <a href="http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?f=001mmxpXt1g4Syi6Gfb4gy6622r5HeDtPXy3ht-kjf7zfAMxk2Pb92SAd3jezC1LQPSSTdbFk5BbiRzQse1vUyk3FQxyjigSJ6MyKXcJKXT_2FiANrnvnIo22-tl3rmwgG9-z2Dn7pb0oQPW4H6jHaxntjHLnCVhFwLpfNENWQeEZ2fAsBuFZm_i_kT6U94QsdLgTF6a2YCzY_S1pgkpBHvHA9o2JnX5W1L&amp;c=LTDR1ZO4bbiuHL02GkQ3CRBvyCnc23brcoJJLC6aHMQEb74lWFybUQ==&amp;ch=TNpL9oAUwglcJWZhgdyIEswvoBlEGvbeEsMPDTI7JeLcgBaimKSJjw==" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?f=001mmxpXt1g4Syi6Gfb4gy6622r5HeDtPXy3ht-kjf7zfAMxk2Pb92SAd3jezC1LQPSSTdbFk5BbiRzQse1vUyk3FQxyjigSJ6MyKXcJKXT_2FiANrnvnIo22-tl3rmwgG9-z2Dn7pb0oQPW4H6jHaxntjHLnCVhFwLpfNENWQeEZ2fAsBuFZm_i_kT6U94QsdLgTF6a2YCzY_S1pgkpBHvHA9o2JnX5W1L&amp;c=LTDR1ZO4bbiuHL02GkQ3CRBvyCnc23brcoJJLC6aHMQEb74lWFybUQ==&amp;ch=TNpL9oAUwglcJWZhgdyIEswvoBlEGvbeEsMPDTI7JeLcgBaimKSJjw==', 'Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon');" target="_blank">Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon</a>. The article also mentions CSPOA several times in relation to Ken Ivory, as though that was a bad thing!</p>
<p>We feel that any discussion of the federal control of public lands should begin with the following infographic. <a href="http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?f=001mmxpXt1g4Syi6Gfb4gy6622r5HeDtPXy3ht-kjf7zfAMxk2Pb92SAd3jezC1LQPSiaaMUm6rzxQ6ZOgt_BGzuHcm8cWINRjfVtLr3YTS5PdkRFQ0r5Fc4KV6cDVzoz3G9pCDl9HO1Rn6e4Mh51-x8Ak7r4uDjElaHPzvILEAcfOP8_GtK4UHtXJL-jF1cF8uSJhUYKya0qTdsVUJVMCTcI5jag2NiVK5ysJSM-VYf8aye1voYP7JFJ8f_AXqPpqnIQ-di_ZmyJZCcssxg-ELzQCixZ8njdCN&amp;c=LTDR1ZO4bbiuHL02GkQ3CRBvyCnc23brcoJJLC6aHMQEb74lWFybUQ==&amp;ch=TNpL9oAUwglcJWZhgdyIEswvoBlEGvbeEsMPDTI7JeLcgBaimKSJjw==" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?f=001mmxpXt1g4Syi6Gfb4gy6622r5HeDtPXy3ht-kjf7zfAMxk2Pb92SAd3jezC1LQPSiaaMUm6rzxQ6ZOgt_BGzuHcm8cWINRjfVtLr3YTS5PdkRFQ0r5Fc4KV6cDVzoz3G9pCDl9HO1Rn6e4Mh51-x8Ak7r4uDjElaHPzvILEAcfOP8_GtK4UHtXJL-jF1cF8uSJhUYKya0qTdsVUJVMCTcI5jag2NiVK5ysJSM-VYf8aye1voYP7JFJ8f_AXqPpqnIQ-di_ZmyJZCcssxg-ELzQCixZ8njdCN&amp;c=LTDR1ZO4bbiuHL02GkQ3CRBvyCnc23brcoJJLC6aHMQEb74lWFybUQ==&amp;ch=TNpL9oAUwglcJWZhgdyIEswvoBlEGvbeEsMPDTI7JeLcgBaimKSJjw==', 'See our blog post for more');" target="_blank">See our blog post for more</a> on this.</p>

<p><strong>The ‘War on Drugs’ is over, and we lost</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Meet the Police Chief who’s starting a revolution in the fight against substance abuse.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Free Thought Project – Leonard Campanello is not your average police officer, which makes him even more of an atypical police chief. While police departments across the United States double down on the war on drugs with more military gear and violence, Campanello is doing it right. While cops continue busting down doors of suspected drug users, and killing their dogs, or killing them, Campanello is reaching out his hand…. “If you are a user of opiates or heroin, let us help you. We know you do not want this addiction. We have resources here in the City that can and will make a difference in your life. Do not become a statistic,” wrote Campanello. Campanello then got in touch with the local mayor and began the Police Assisted Addiction and Recovery Initiative (P.A.A.R.I.) which would help drug addicts instead of lock them in cages.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Update from Richard Mack:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I recently spent the day with Sheriff David Clarke and his wife Julie and attended a Milwaukee Brewers game together. Sheriff Clarke was kind enough to have his staff give me a tour of the county jail and the Sheriff’s Office.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Sheriff Clarke was the CSPOA sheriff of the year in 2013 and has since then become a voice of reason nationally for FOX News. Sheriff Clarke continues his strong relationship with CSPOA and urges one and all to be CSPOA members.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It was a great day; the Brewers even won!</p>

<content:encoded>Bill Clinton and Janet Reno are alleged to have conspired with the ATF and FBI to bring down the FBI Maury building in Oklahoma City (False Flag) and if you noticed…one of the 25 or so suspicious deaths involving Clinton, was in the building on the day it was bombed.
<p>“A new documentary has been released regarding the Oklahoma City bombing on April 19, 1995, which shows with copious evidence that the bombing was not the act of one man, Timothy McVeigh, but that McVeigh was but a mind-controlled patsy for sinister forces within the U.S. government who wanted to use that event as a pretext to finally pass Bill Clinton’s Anti-Terrorism bill, which would not have passed without something of that magnitude to spur it.”</p>

<p>Obviously, from watching the Clinton Chronicles, the Clintons are capable of doing anything they want…and are we to see more coming our way when Hillary gets the crown? </p>
<p>I smell a revolution stirring when anything and everything will be considered.</p>

<content:encoded>Jennings,<br/>
Thank you for noticing that I point the finger of accusation at all four immediately past and current Presidents. A much larger agenda is afoot in America since G.H.W. Bush-41 signed onto the UN’s Agenda 21 program in the early 1990s. Both parties have supported our military-industrial complex abroad and the tyranny staring us in the face domestically, beginning with the war on drugs and expanding into the so-called war on terror. Both parties have supported a massive misperception in the public mind, imo. That is my personal opinion.<br/>
Thank you for reading here and leaving your comments.<br/>
Salute!<br/>
Elias Alias, editor

<content:encoded>Mr. Elias Alias in his commentary for this article criticizes Presidents both past and present, both Dems and from the GOP.

<content:encoded>After a fair trial of course, that was SOOOOO funny to me. Can you imagine waking up every morning to a face like that?

<content:encoded>I like the way you think BUD. Highflight took about 20,000 words to say nothing of any importance as there will never ever be anything done about the Clintons through the just system. You on the other hand have put forth a very simple solution to the problem with a scant few words of total simplicity and workability.<br/>
I think you hit the nail on the head. We can bring up all the old stuff as needed AFTER we lock them up and right before we hang them for treason. After a fair trial of course.

<content:encoded>NOBODY is going to be allowed to “drive any damned coffin nails” into a “preconceived New World Order (of a one-sided sort).  We have over 50 million veterans, most of them combat trained, and most of them more than able to (still) kick serious ass.  Are you “sick &amp; tired” of dealing with these frigging “Domestic Enemies?”  We The People ARE THE DAMNED MILITIA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  That means WE THE PEOPLE can “simply take them down, OUT of office and into a jail cell (not one of theirs …one of OUR cells.  Anyone here think that even 25 million, armed and trained (or untrained) veterans couldn’t permanently render DC a ghost town overnight?  We The People RUN this country via elected leaders.  These leaders have largely failed us, screwed us over and now intend to kill our asses.<br/>
Dunno about you folks, but I’m going to fight just as soon as I have my cross-hairs where they belong.  As a 100% disabled veteran, I’ve given over 35years of my life to The USA (and her people). DAMNED IF I AM GOING TO LAY DOWN MY ARMS AND WATCH ALL THE BLOOD SWEAT AND TEARS GO TO WASTE!  (I’m not nearly crazy ….not yet anyway).  However, these domestic enemies seek to “retrain your minds” (or just kill ya if it’s more convenient for them).<br/>
Doesn’t this bother the shit out of anyone except me?<br/>
Let’s get our shit together and then “oust” the “sobs” who have placed us in greater peril than I care to dwell upon.  It seems logical to me that the very first thing that needs doing is taking back this country from the murderers we have elected (or so they say we elected them).  THEN we can rebuild without having to put up with the likes of them seeking to “give the USA away” to the highest bidders …and we’ll eliminate OUR leaders constantly attempting to disarm us using lies lies and more lies, false this and that.  Come on folks …are we really going to sit on our asses and actually LET THEM GET AWAY WITH THIS BULLSHIT?<br/>
Count me out.  I intend to shoot.  I may well die from “return fire” …but I’ll damn sure leave this world saying that “I tried.”<br/>
Whoever at OathKeepers is “keeping tabs”, I request that you put me down as a “wanna-be member.”  (Active member for North Carolina …but can travel (literally) anywhere with no-prior notice needed).<br/>
I am sure everyone is aware now that ALL OF THE EMAILS between Hillary and Obama are not going to be released until BamBam is “out of office.”  (That way he can’t be impeached).  It also surely sounds suspicious …as though Hillary already has been elected …and the votes we make are “just for looks.”  …and the media feeds us full of ‘bs’ …to promote THEIR agendas.  And, We The People just keep sitting, and doing little to nothing.  I just do not understand …unless everyone has turned-tail and would rather be enslaved and live than “live free or die?”  Maybe so, since there is little evidence to the contrary.  (These people are ELECTED …they are NOTHING)!  We The People placed them there ….we can oust them just as easily …might take a few Glocks and AR’s, but they’ll take the hint don’t ya think folks?
<p>Never too old to kick ass…</p>

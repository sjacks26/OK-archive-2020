WW2 Vet Warren Bodeker
## Conversation between Rhodes & Bodeker

## Key words/themes: Veteran; courts; injustice; gold

Story of his WW2 service, prison camp liberation
## Why spend so much time with this? Most of the first 5 mins. Story. Meant for listeners to identify w/ Bodeker, in the hopes that such a connection will move people to help him?

WB talks about his wife and their house (5 mins)

WB filed for bankruptcy to clear debt. Stepson from former marriage told court Bodeker was hiding assets. (6 mins) Trustee decided to search WB’s property for assets. Walked in his front door & said “I own everything you have” (8 mins)

Trustee & deputy sheriff confiscated guns & sheep’s head WB didn’t list as assets. Didn’t find any gold or silver hidden (9 mins)

WB started buying gold and silver pre-1964. Didn’t disclose gold & silver, thought of them as retirement or “in case the economy went bad” (10 mins)

WB accused of concealing assets. Threatened with proceedings to seize homestead and sell it. WB’s lawyer talked Bodeker into agreeing to forfeit his homestead to avoid proceeding and lawyer bills. WB agreed to waive homestead exemption. (11 mins)

When house sells, WB will have to exhume his wife’s body. (15 mins)

Rhodes: Did you ever intend to sell your house?
WB: No Rhodes: Did you ever want to sell your house? WB: No with some comments (15:30)

Rhodes: When you went to file bankruptcy, you had no intention to use your home to satisfy creditors, right?
WB: No I did not
Rhodes: Homestead exemption means creditors can’t get your home no matter what. Bankruptcy court accused you of concealing assets, pressured you to agree to sell your home, is that right? (16:40)

Rhodes says the trustee hiring herself as lawyer seems like a conflict of interest. (18:30)

WB filed another homestead exemption when he received a notice to vacate his house within 5 days. He previously filed liens and other things.

WB’s lawyer withdrew. He has no attorney (19:50)

Rhodes: Every lawyer swears an oath to defend the Constitution and to do justice…. I can’t think of a worse example of injustice than forcing WW2 vet who fought for all our rights including property rights to sell the home and land he expected to be buried in next to his wife, force him to exhume his wife, leave him “homeless and potentially penniless.” (21:15) The just thing to do would have been to deny the discharge (of bankruptcy) but not do the rest.

Rhodes: Trustee seems brutal and callous. “Have you seen her display any signs of Christian charity…?” (22:45)
WB: “seems like I oughta get a little justice”

Rhodes: Banks get bailouts. People don’t. He says this is how things are, and it’s messed up. (24 mins)
Rhodes apologizes to Bodeker on behalf of lawyers.

Rhodes wants other vets to speak out against this injustice against one of their brothers: “You fought against fascism…. Every day, it seems like this government is becoming more and more like the governments you fought against.” (25 mins)

WB: What I see happening almost makes me ashamed of my country. “I cannot get one day of justice in the court”

Rhodes asks Bodeker about the country generally. (26 mins)
WB: The country has changed so much “I don’t even recognize it anymore.” There is no justice, even if you get pulled over on the highway. We’re moving from “freedom to slavery.” We need to stand up individually or we will be totally controlled.

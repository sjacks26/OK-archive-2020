<h1 style="text-align: center;">Sunday Reading: ALIPAC Registers Success Across Nation</h1>
<p><strong>Arizona Oath Keeper Kait Hylton</strong> has sent in updates on the protest demonstrations against illegal immigration and the government’s role in promoting illegal entry into the USA. Those demonstrations were coordinated by William Gheen, founder of “Americans for Legal Immigration PAC” (ALIPAC) and James Neighbors, founder of “Overpasses For America”.</p>
<p>On short notice, and with the invitation from William Gheen of ALIPAC, Oath Keepers rallied protesters to attend the more than three hundred protest events. Kait Hylton is a veteran of more than ten years as a volunteer in the border wars, and she keeps up to date info on developments along the border from California to Texas. It was Kait who acted as liaison between ALIPAC and Oath Keepers.</p>
<p>Kait has extensive experience in desert patrols, observation activities, and night movements to assist the Border Patrol. She has worked on the borders in both California and Arizona. She is an ardent supporter of the Oath Keepers mission, and her primary personal focus is on the border problem. She is as concerned as the rest of us that our political representatives inside government continue to totally ignore the Oath they swore to the Constitution.</p>
<p>As she and I agree, when the government breaks its own law there is no law. And while ALIPAC and Overpasses For America are focused on giving the boot to all politicians who support amnesty and the Obama Administration’s complicity in swelling the numbers of illegal aliens crossing our southern border, Oath Keepers realizes that America’s troubles may now be beyond any political solution. Yet it is important that American patriots make their voices heard, if for no other reason than to help awaken our good neighbors. Therefore Oath Keepers is encouraging our membership to participate in upcoming ALIPAC and Overpasses For America protests. Wear your Oath Keepers gear proudly and with dignity. Being as Kait was holding the camera, we have no pics of her in her Oath Keepers gear at this particular protest. Kait took the picture below.</p>

<p>Please enjoy reading about last weekend’s successful wave of protests against illegal immigration. The following is from ALIPAC’s website:</p>

<p><strong>For the first time</strong> in the history of America, hundreds of protests took place against illegal immigration within the last 24 hours!</p>
<p>With a coalition of more than 50 groups and organizations of various sizes, protests against illegal immigration and the Obama inspired surge of illegals at America’s borders took place in more than 300 locations. The protests were highly visible and some were small with a handful of people on overpasses with others being larger with hundreds of people.</p>
<p>The hundreds of protests have achieved the goals of raising public awareness of the Obama created border surge of illegals. The goal of putting politicians on notice was also achieved and several protest locations had candidates running for Congress present.</p>
<p>These historic protests generated talk radio show attention, televised reports, and hundreds of local news reports, thus breaking through the media blockade against the effort maintained by CNN, MSNBC, ABC, CBS, etc.</p>
<p>ALIPAC would like to thank all of the Americans who came out in the last two days, all of the different groups that really came together in coalition behind this effort, and all of the new media outlets that did their job right by telling people about these events beforehand! For interviews or to learn more about these protests against illegal immigration, please visit<a href=" http://www.alipac.us/" target="_blank"> http://www.alipac.us/</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Speaking of the rallies</strong>, Kait Kylton noted that at the rally she attended there were seven or more police officers and two plain-clothes officers. She told me that only two La Raza goons showed up to taunt the protesters, and those two quickly made fools of themselves.</p>
<p>Kait said that the Stolen Quilt Project was on display there – focusing on Americans killed by illegal aliens. Further, Kait said, one woman was wearing a surgical mask as she carried a sign representing “Healthcare Workers Against Illegal Aliens”, and a guy with the “Latinos for Legal Immigration” was very vocal against illegal immigration. She said that two local news affiliates (ABC and FOX) attended. Also, Rusty Childers of Riders USA attended.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Kait was the only Oath Keeper there at that protest in Oath Keepers gear. She figures it was a miscommunication, as some other Oath Keepers she knows were there but were not in Oath Keepers gear. Stewart Rhodes reminds us all that any event co-sponsored or solely sponsored by Oath Keepers is fine for wearing our Oath Keepers gear. More upcoming opportunities to wear our gear are noted below.</p>

<p>Kait said that she passed out a lot of Oath Keepers brochures, cards, and pocket Constitutions, including to police officers. In Kait’s words, <em>“They said they couldn’t take anything while on duty even as a couple of them slipped them in their pockets.”</em></p>
<p>Oath Keepers will continue to work with ALIPAC, which has upcoming protests scheduled for three State primaries. Working with Overpasses For America, ALIPAC and Oath Keepers will call forth all who can to attend a number of protests between now and October.  These are non-partisan organizations who welcome Oath Keepers and with whom we are proud to work on the border issue. Here are some details from the ALIPAC  and Overpasses For America websites: [<em>Quoting from ALIPAC and Overpasses For America websites]</em></p>
<p><strong>Fri-Sat October 24-25</strong> Nationwide / All States</p>
<p><strong>Sat. August 23</strong>, Florida (Outside of GOP Amnesty Supporters Offices)</p>
<p><strong>Sat. August 9</strong>, Wisconsin (Outside of GOP Amnesty Supporters Offices)</p>
<p><strong>Sat. August 2</strong>, Tennessee, Washington State, Michigan (Outside of GOP Amnesty Supporters Offices)</p>
<p><strong>August 2, 9, 23</strong>: Join us for very important targeted protests that will take place outside of the district offices of Republicans who support Luis Gutierrez and Obama’s immigration reform amnesty plans just as Eric Cantor (R-VA) did before we threw him out of office! We have more of Eric Cantor’s GOP allies on immigration reform amnesty to defeat by raising awareness with protests August 2 in Tennessee, Washington State, and Michigan. Then in Wisconsin on Sat. Aug 9, and in Florida on Sat Aug 23. See <a href="http://www.alipac.us/f8/protest-times-locations-national-protests-against-illegal-immigration-amnesty-307707/" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.alipac.us/f8/protest-times-locations-national-protests-against-illegal-immigration-amnesty-307707/', 'list ');" target="_blank"><strong><em>list</em></strong> </a>below for which Republicans support amnesty. Activists from all states are encouraged to travel and participate in targeted states. We also will have volunteer call programs set up to call voters in these states from home!</p>

<p><em>“We want to call attention to the important elections of 2014 and the  issue of America’s illegal immigration crisis!” </em>said <strong>James <span id="IL_AD8">Neighbors</span></strong>, founder of Overpasses for America. <em> “We want our state groups to quickly organize and we want our most  experienced protesters from across the nation to converge with us on  Tennessee, Washington, and Michigan.”</em></p>

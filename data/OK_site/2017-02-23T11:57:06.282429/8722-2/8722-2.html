<p>Here is where many political and economic analysts go terribly wrong in their examination of current global paradigms: They tend to blindly believe the mainstream narrative rather than taking into account conflicting actions and statements by political and financial leaders. Even in the liberty movement, composed of some of the most skeptical and media savvy people on planet Earth, the cancers of assumption and bias often take hold.</p>
<p>Some liberty proponents are more than happy to believe in particular mainstream dynamics. They are happy to believe, for example, that the growing “conflict” between the East and West is legitimate rather than engineered.</p>
<p>You can list off quotation after quotation and policy action after policy action proving that Eastern governments, including China and Russia, work hand in hand with globalist institutions like the International Monetary Fund, the Bank of International Settlements, the World Bank and the U.N. toward the goal of global governance and global economic centralization. But these people simply will not listen. They MUST believe that the U.S. is the crowning villain, and that the East is in heroic opposition. They are so desperate for a taste of hope they are ready to consume the poison of false dichotomies.</p>
<p>The liberty movement is infatuated with the presumption that the U.S. government and the banking elites surrounding it are at the “top” of the new world order pyramid and are “clamoring for survival” as the U.S. economy crumbles under the facade of false government and central banking statistics. How many times have we heard over the past year alone that the Federal Reserve has “backed itself into a corner” or policy directed itself “between a rock and a hard place?”</p>
<p>I have to laugh at the absurdity of such a viewpoint because central bankers and internationalists have always used economic instability as a means to gain political and social advantage. The consolidation of world banking power alone after the Great Depression is a testament to this fact. And even former Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/Speeches/2002/20021108/default.htm" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/Speeches/2002/20021108/default.htm', 'has admitted');" target="_blank">has admitted</a> (at least in certain respects) that the Federal Reserve was responsible for that terrible implosion, an implosion that conveniently served the interests of international cartel banks like JPMorgan.</p>
<p>But the Federal Reserve is no more than an appendage of a greater system; it is NOT the brains of the operation.</p>
<p>In his book “Tragedy And Hope,” Carroll Quigley, Council on Foreign Relations member and mentor to Bill Clinton, stated:</p>
<p><em><strong>“It must not be felt that these heads of the world’s chief central banks were themselves substantive powers in world finance. They were not. Rather, they were the technicians and agents of the dominant investment bankers of their own countries, who had raised them up and were perfectly capable of throwing them down. The substantive financial powers of the world were in the hands of these investment bankers (also called “international” or “merchant” bankers) who remained largely behind the scenes in their own unincorporated private banks. These formed a system of international cooperation and national dominance which was more private, more powerful, and more secret than that of their agents in the central banks.”</strong></em></p>
<p>In <a href="http://www.edwardjayepstein.com/archived/moneyclub.htm" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.edwardjayepstein.com/archived/moneyclub.htm', '“Ruling The World Of Money,”');">“Ruling The World Of Money,”</a> Harper’s Magazine established what Quigley admitted in “Tragedy And Hope” — that the control of the global economic policy and, by extension, political policy is dominated by a select few elites, namely through the unaccountable institutional framework of the BIS.</p>
<p>The U.S. and the Federal Reserve are mere tentacles of the great vampire squid that is the new world order. And being a tentacle makes one, to a certain extent, expendable, if the trade will result in even greater centralization of power.</p>
<p>The delusion that some people within the liberty movement are under is that the fall of America will result in the fall of the new world order. In reality, the fall of America is a necessary step towards the RISE of the new world order. The Rothschild-owned financial magazine The Economist reaffirmed this trend of economic “harmonization” in its 1988 article <a href="https://socioecohistory.wordpress.com/2014/07/26/flashback-1988-get-ready-for-a-world-currency-by-2018%E2%80%B3-the-economist-magazine/" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'https://socioecohistory.wordpress.com/2014/07/26/flashback-1988-get-ready-for-a-world-currency-by-2018%E2%80%B3-the-economist-magazine/', '“Get Ready For A World Currency By 2018,”');" target="_blank">“Get Ready For A World Currency By 2018,”</a> which described the creation of a global currency called the “Phoenix” over three decades:</p>
<p><em><strong>“The phoenix zone would impose tight constraints on national governments. There would be no such thing, for instance, as a national monetary policy. The world phoenix supply would be fixed by a new central bank, descended perhaps from the IMF. The world inflation rate — and hence, within narrow margins, each national inflation rate — would be in its charge. Each country could use taxes and public spending to offset temporary falls in demand, but it would have to borrow rather than print money to finance its budget deficit. With no recourse to the inflation tax, governments and their creditors would be forced to judge their borrowing and lending plans more carefully than they do today. This means a big loss of economic sovereignty, but the trends that make the phoenix so appealing are taking that sovereignty away in any case.”</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>“…The phoenix would probably start as a cocktail of national currencies, just as the Special Drawing Right is today. In time, though, its value against national currencies would cease to matter, because people would choose it for its convenience and the stability of its purchasing power.”</strong></em></p>
<p>We are now on the cusp of the “prediction” set forth by The Economist over 27 years ago. The BRICS nations, including Vladimir Putin’s Russia, have all consistently called for the formation of a global reserve currency system under the direct control of the IMF and predicated on the basket methodology of the SDR. This new global system, as The Economist suggested, requires the marginalization of existing power structures and the end of sovereign economic control. Governments around the world including the U.S. would be at the fiscal mercy of the new financial high priests through the use of insidious debt based incentives given or withheld at the whim of the IMF.</p>
<p>China is set to be inducted into the SDR basket in 2015, with specific economic changes to be made by September 2016, a development <a href="http://www.alt-market.com/articles/1108-is-the-world-abandoning-the-us-economy" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.alt-market.com/articles/1108-is-the-world-abandoning-the-us-economy', 'I have been warning about for years');">I have been warning about for years</a>. The “vote” is in and the decision has been finalized.  While some in the mainstream media are playing off the rise of the Yuan as meaningless, IMF head Christine Lagarde presents the shift as a major event, not for China, but for the IMF and the SDR which she proudly refers to as the “currency of currencies”.</p>

<p>The addition of <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-11-29/did-the-yuan-really-pass-the-imf-currency-test-you-ll-know-soon" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-11-29/did-the-yuan-really-pass-the-imf-currency-test-you-ll-know-soon', 'China');" target="_blank">China</a> to the SDR, I believe, is the next trigger event for the continuing removal of the dollar as the world reserve currency. The monetary shift may explode with speed if Saudi Arabia follows through with a possible plan to <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-11-22/cut-oil-supply-or-drop-riyal-peg-saudis-face-critical-choice" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-11-22/cut-oil-supply-or-drop-riyal-peg-saudis-face-critical-choice', 'depeg');" target="_blank">depeg</a> from the dollar, effectively ending the petrodollar status the U.S. has enjoyed for decades.</p>
<p>This is, of course, the same IMF-controlled SDR system that Putin and the Kremlin have called for, despite the running <a href="http://personalliberty.com/false-eastwest-paradigm-and-the-end-of-freedom/" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://personalliberty.com/false-eastwest-paradigm-and-the-end-of-freedom/', 'fantasy');" rel="”nofollow”" target="_blank">fantasy</a> that Putin is somehow an opponent of the globalists.</p>
<p>Putin continues to press the “U.S. as bumbling villain” narrative, while at the same time supporting globalist institutions and the internationalization of economic and political governance. While many people were overly focused on his “calling out” of the U.S. and its involvement in the creation of ISIS in his <a href="http://www.russianmission.eu/en/news/president-vladimir-putin-addresses-un-general-assembly" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.russianmission.eu/en/news/president-vladimir-putin-addresses-un-general-assembly', 'recent speech');" target="_blank">recent speech</a> at the U.N., they seemed to have completely overlooked his adoration of the United Nations and the development of a global governing body. Putin often speaks at cross purposes just as Barack Obama does — one minute supporting sovereignty and freedom, the next minute calling for global centralization:</p>
<p><em><strong>“Russia is ready to work together with its partners to develop the UN further on the basis of a broad consensus, but we consider any attempts to undermine the legitimacy of the United Nations as extremely dangerous. They may result in the collapse of the entire architecture of international relations, and then indeed there will be no rules left except for the rule of force.”</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>“Dear colleagues, ensuring peace and global and regional stability remains a key task for the international community guided by the United Nations. We believe this means creating an equal and indivisible security environment that would not serve a privileged few, but everyone.”</strong></em></p>
<p>Putin also proclaimed his support for the UN’s fight against “climate change”, the same climate change which Secretary of State John Kerry argued was a “contributing factor” in the <a href="http://time.com/4113801/climate-change-terrorism/" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://time.com/4113801/climate-change-terrorism/', 'crisis in Syria');">crisis in Syria</a> and the rise of ISIS.  I have <a href="http://www.alt-market.com/articles/1718-worlds-top-climate-scientists-admit-qcomputersq-got-global-warming-wrong" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.alt-market.com/articles/1718-worlds-top-climate-scientists-admit-qcomputersq-got-global-warming-wrong', 'written in the past');">written in the past</a> on the fraud of “man made climate change (global warming)” and will not enter that tangent here now, but the point remains that Putin is fully on board with said fraud like all other puppet politicians around the globe:</p>
<p><em><strong>“…One more issue that shall affect the future of the entire humankind is climate change. It is in our interest to ensure that the coming UN Climate Change Conference that will take place in Paris in December this year should deliver some feasible results. As part of our national contribution, we plan to limit greenhouse gas emissions to 70–75 percent of the 1990 levels by the year 2030.”</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>“It is indeed a challenge of global proportions. And I am confident that humanity does have the necessary intellectual capacity to respond to it. We need to join our efforts, primarily engaging countries that possess strong research and development capabilities, and have made significant advances in fundamental research. We propose convening a special forum under the auspices of the UN to comprehensively address issues related to the depletion of natural resources, habitat destruction, and climate change. Russia is willing to co-sponsor such a forum.”</strong></em></p>
<p>Indeed, it has been Putin’s <a href="http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/46218" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/46218', 'intention');" target="_blank">intention</a> all along to support and defend the internationalist framework while at the same time participating in the theatrical East versus West false paradigm:</p>
<p><em><strong>“In the BRICS case we see a whole set of coinciding strategic interests.</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>First of all, this is the common intention to reform the international monetary and financial system. In the present form it is unjust to the BRICS countries and to new economies in general. We should take a more active part in the IMF and the World Bank’s decision-making system. The international monetary system itself depends a lot on the US dollar, or, to be precise, on the monetary and financial policy of the US authorities. The BRICS countries want to change this.”</strong></em></p>
<p>The Chinese <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Business/story?id=7168919" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://abcnews.go.com/Business/story?id=7168919', 'support the same agenda');">support the same agenda</a> of an IMF managed economic world:</p>
<p><em><strong>The world economic crisis shows the “inherent vulnerabilities and systemic risks in the existing international monetary system,” Gov. Zhou Xiaochuan said in an essay released Monday by the bank. He recommended creating a currency made up of a basket of global currencies and controlled by the International Monetary Fund and said it would help “to achieve the objective of safeguarding global economic and financial stability.”</strong></em></p>
<p>It is rather interesting how the desires of the BRICS seem to directly coincide with the designs of international bankers. This Hegelian dialectic is perhaps the most elaborate public distraction of all time, with the ultimate solution to the artificially engineered problem being a single “multilateral” but centrally dictated world economic system and world government, i.e., the new world order.</p>
<p>Again, the globalists at the BIS and the IMF require a diminished U.S. dollar, greatly reduced U.S. living standards and a much smaller U.S. geopolitical footprint before they can establish and finalize a single publicly accepted global elitist oligarchy.</p>
<p>If you cannot understand why it seems that the Federal Reserve and U.S. government appear hell-bent on self-destruction, then perhaps you should consider the facts and motivations at hand. Then, you’ll realize it is THEIR JOB to destroy America, not save America. When you are finally willing to accept this reality, every disastrous development since the inception of the Fed a century ago, as well as all that is about to happen in the next few years, makes perfect sense.</p>
<p>This is not to say that the ultimate endgame of the new world order will result in victory. But the cold, hard, concrete evidence shows that internationalists do have a plan; they are implementing that plan systematically; and all major governments around the world are participating in that plan. This plan involves the inevitable collapse and reformation of America into a Third World enclave, a goal that is nearly complete, as I will outline in my next article.</p>
<p>As the U.S. destabilizes, we are not escaping the clutches of the Federal Reserve system, only trading out one totalitarian management model for another. It is absolutely vital that the liberty movement in particular finally and fully embrace this reality. If we do not, then there will truly be no obstacle to such a plan’s success and no end to the tyrannies of the old world or the new world.</p>

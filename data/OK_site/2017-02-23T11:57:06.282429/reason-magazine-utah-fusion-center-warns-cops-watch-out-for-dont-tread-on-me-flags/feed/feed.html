<content:encoded>Cal,I agree with you 100%. That being said there is not a more difficult task to articulate or make people understand even though the facts and history are all there for all to see as you state. Thanks for all your info, Always…

<content:encoded>Understood.  Given just that much as decidedly being the truth (as we have all seen the “memo” that was distributed to LEOs and such ….then it is a foregone conclusion that one should remove (except from their home’s front/back doors), any and all stickers that might (potentially) get you pulled over.  This is a way of (passive) disarming an LEO in that “he sees nothing therefore knows nothing” – so down the road you go.  I believe in operating as covertly as possible.  The more of a surprise that you can make, the better your odds are of surviving “immoral &amp; illegal” tactics currently being employed by (non-constitutional) LEOs, DHS, FBI, etc) &lt;—All of these alphabet agencies need to be done away with in totality.  Whatever happened to the Federal Government being "next to nothing"?  In these so called modern times, it appears we are about to be inundated with "crazies, lunatics, and power-hungry nutzoids from every corner of the globe!<br/>
Prepare for a war that will exceed the sum-total (in horrors) of all other wars combined …now, that is hard to imagine, but as immoral as ppl have become (those 'seated in power') …it would be illogical to presume anything less than 100% havoc, never-ceasing and of course, 100% psyops (at full fury) being dumped into ALL media.  (Which is why we NEVER watch TV …movies, etc).  Lies lies lies lies lies….

<content:encoded>After my father passed on I was given a parchment that had been in the family for years.  In The Battle of Bunker Hill, my ‘direct’ ancestor was the wagoneer for that battle.  Aaron Eames.  So, I am also in this for the long run.  <img alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" src="https://www.oathkeepers.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;"/>

<content:encoded>Starting many moons ago, the wife and I decided that FL was NOT anyplace we needed to be (given our love of firearms, shooting paper, cans, innocent beasts (j/k) …so we moved to FAR Western North Carolina ….up HIGH in ‘them thar hills’ we’ve managed to use our land (which is a good sized ‘mount’ surrounded by (sorta) flat-land).  Chickens, gardens (three so far – all of them “hay” weedless type), perimeter sensors ( I made these as I am fortunate enough to be able to design ‘not so intricate’ circuits and then put them to use (as I may need them to do) …not to mention far cheaper!  Anyway, just like Wmjoe hopes (and will) accomplish, we are prolly FAR older (I am 59 …gawd, and I just keep getting olderer and olderer)!<br/>
There are SO MANY THINGS that a person can do with their land (as do many country folk), that it is impossible to touch upon all aspects of it in this post ….but I promise I’ll get the info into a PDF and then supply a link to it for those with land.  (If you are within city limits or anything but rural (and have a small bit of $$), strongly consider moving away from any ‘raging metropolis’ AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.  Major cities will be the first ones “they” will hit.  (I am unsure how they’ll go about dealing with “country folk” …since we know our land better than they, and for this ex-Navy vet being rural makes it all much less complex. imho<br/>
Ya know, it is possible that “it” will hit the fan when the patriots realize that the next elected prez was “installed” by the feds …and screw who everyone actually voted for.  Yes ….they ARE THAT IMMORAL and as everyone agrees, they are not above doing anything (legal or not) to see that things go “their way.”  (…and f*ck whatever you want or to them; THINK you want).  Signed, Equorial – pissed off big-time Navy retiree.  Also, I do agree THEY must make an offensive “move” that we can then “go on the defensive against” …and the rest will be history.<br/>
Why do we not establish an ‘unknown site’ on TOR?  After all, the last thing we wish to be doing is ADVERTISING and openly discussing everything (cuz you KNOW they are watching horrible terrorists such as ourselves …so why not use the same damn TOR that they do to hide everything?  Feedback please?  Also, using GNU/Linux is 1000x safer than any Windows will ever be, and is now so very much like windows (but a bit harder), you’ll hardly notice the diff.  To give you an idea of what you can do with Linux ….there are now over 43,000 “stable” and very useful programs (not to mention you can write your own for ANYTHING you wish …and your Linux ‘box’ will happily teach it all to you – and you never ever have to reload if it happens to break (you simply fix the errors (usually tells you how), and you are back up in seconds or minutes.<br/>
Any thoughts on making use of TOR anyone?  I am just thinking ‘security’ (and we know THEY love watching us …so let’s just disappear)?  lol…

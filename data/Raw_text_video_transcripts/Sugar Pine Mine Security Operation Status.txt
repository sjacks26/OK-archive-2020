## Joseph Rice

JR: I’m the JoCo coordinator for JoCo OK. We were asked by the Sugar Pine Mine claim owners to come in and help protect their 5A rights to due process. We did move a security team to the mining claim, we’ve secured the claim, and I’ve been incredibly fortunate to have a group of highly skilled, professional individuals come in to do that. Our command is unified. We are working together and communicating extremely well. If you’re on a fringe element and you’re here to protest or provoke a reaction from the federal government, I don’t want you here. Let me say that again. If you’re here to protest and provoke a reaction with the federal government, I do not need you. We are here to protect 5A due process that’s attempted to be violated by BLM. I want skilled professionals, people that will work with each other and cooperate. With that, I have operational control and security of the mine. I talk directly to the mine claim owners, Rick and George, daily. If it didn’t come out of my mouth, it’s bullshit. Thank you.

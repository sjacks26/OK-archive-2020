<content:encoded>Great post Cal as usual with you! Still a great site also. All I have to say to our terrorist leader is. If you send someone to my house for my emergency supplies that I’ve purchased for my family to survive on our own for a while in time of an emergency. Then you better be prepared to get past my emergency supply of LEGAL ammunition! Bless O. K. And God bless America!

<content:encoded>The US Constitution is above any statute.  
<p>Taking food, etc from the American people is Treason and *Terrorism if serving within our governments, or an attack on our nation if not owing allegiance to the USA. It matters not what statute/regulation/law/etc they use as their “excuse” because those that SERVE WITHIN OUR GOVERNMENTS – and that includes the military and law enforcement – are BOUND to support the US Constitution FIRST AND ABOVE anything else; orders of superiors, duties of the position they occupy, etc.</p>
<p>Do NOT “just follow orders” or “just do your job”; KNOW what you are doing and make the choice of being a TRAITOR to the American people and the US Constitution KNOWINGLY because once we get to prosecuting you (general “you”), it matters not that you were “just following orders” or “just doing your job” – you will be held accountable in a REAL court of law without a treasonous or domestic enemy judge and prosecutor.</p>
<p>Read the US Constitution, read the framers words – even if only their quotes, ask for clarification from Oathkeepers or cspoa.org, or tenthamendmentcenter.com, or … and they will assist you in coming back to the correct path or being able to choose your own path. </p>
<p>It would suck if you got the death penalty for treason for “just following orders” or “just doing your job” – MAKE IT A KNOWLEDGEABLE CHOICE if you’re going to take the chance that will happen.</p>
<p>Thomas Jefferson: “The most effectual means of preventing [the perversion of power into tyranny are] to illuminate, as far as practicable, the minds of the people at large, and more especially to give them knowledge of those facts which history exhibits, that possessed thereby of the experience of other ages and countries, they may be enabled to know ambition under all its shapes, and prompt to exert their natural powers to defeat its purposes.” </p>
<p>Read the US Constitution, both the Preamble to the US Constitution and the Preamble to the Bill of Rights, the Nuremberg Trials, etc.</p>
<p>*28 C.F.R. Section 0.85 Terrorism is defined as “the unlawful use of force and violence against persons or property to intimidate or coerce a government, the civilian population, or any segment thereof, in furtherance of political or social objectives”. </p>
<p>Some words from the past</p>
<p>Abraham Lincoln: “We, the people, are the rightful masters of both congress and the courts – not to overthrow the constitution, but to overthrow men who pervert the Constitution”</p>
<p>Thomas Jefferson: “Tyranny is defined as that which is legal for the government but illegal for the citizenry.”</p>
<p>James Madison, Federalist 14: “In the first place, it is to be remembered, that the general government is not to be charged with the whole power of making and administering laws. Its jurisdiction is limited to certain enumerated objects, which concern all the members of the republic, but which are not to be attained by the separate provisions of any”.</p>
<p>Alexander Hamilton: “Every act of a delegated authority, contrary to the tenor of the commission under which it is exercised, is void. No legislative act, therefore, contrary to the Constitution, can be valid. To deny this, would be to affirm, that the deputy is greater than his principal; that the servant is above his master; that the representatives of the people are superior to the people themselves; that men acting by virtue of powers, may do not only what their powers do not authorize, but what they forbid.”</p>
<p>Thomas Jefferson: “[A] strict observance of the written law is doubtless one of the high duties of a good citizen, but it is not the highest. The laws of necessity, of self-preservation, of saving our country when in danger, are of higher obligation. To lose our country by a scrupulous adherence to the written law, would be to lose the law itself, with life, liberty, property and all those who are enjoying them with us; thus absurdly sacrificing the ends to the means.” </p>
<p>Thomas Jefferson: “The government created by this compact (the Constitution) was not made the exclusive or final judge of the extent of the powers delegated to itself; since that would have made its discretion, and not the Constitution, the measure of its powers; but that, as in all other cases of compact among powers having no common judge, each party (the people of each state) has an equal right to judge for itself, as well of infractions as of the mode and measure of redress.”</p>
<p>Thomas Jefferson: “It would be a dangerous delusion were a confidence in the men of our choice to silence our fears for the safety of our rights; that confidence is everywhere the parent of despotism; free government is founded in jealousy, and not in confidence; it is jealousy, and not confidence, which prescribes limited constitutions to bind down those whom we are obliged to trust with power; that our Constitution has accordingly fixed the limits to which, and no farther, our confidence may go…. In questions of power, let no more be said of confidence in man, but bind him down from mischief by the chains of the Constitution.”</p>

<content:encoded>I look to places like Switzerland and Israel for models on dealing with diverse populations and neighbors who are not friendly, community driven local governments, local defense forces, total involvement in both, a healthy gun culture. I’m not sold on having a few samurai warrior class people handling things. Our country once embraced the “citizen soldier” or militiamen before it was coopted by the Feds and demonized. Having a professional class has removed us from the realities of our societies. Bringing back posses and militia, fostering involvement would go a long way to making this a stronger safer America.

<content:encoded>Quite well said. Creating more collectives within existing collectives. With, the same basic attitude  as Big Government towards the masses. To adopt the tactics of the enemy is to become what they supposedly despise. Preppers and Survivalists are generally not on  the Elite’s priority list as most advertise to easily. Getting off the grid is rather quite laughable on occasions as well.. A clear and present danger that would be at the top of the list include those most willing to preserve and protect and defend at the community level from sea to shining sea as I salute all of thee.

<content:encoded>“I would say that while the ignorant are a danger to us and themselves, we would also be contributing to the decay of our society by refusing to help others when we have the ability to do so. ”
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>We were to never let a corrupt person stay in office, no matter what position they occupy.</p>
<p>We must not allow them to corrupt us, because they can only take America down from the inside by corrupting her people or importing a corrupt people who do not understand our way of life – and they have been corrupting us since the 60’s or so.</p>

<content:encoded>Feb 13, 2015 Police: Reclaim Your Integrity
<p>Are you a police employee? Now is the time to step back and take an inventory of your own actions. How has your time as a police employee changed you? Are you more loving? Or have you become more jaded? Are you still driven by the same motivation now as you were when you started out policing? There is a way out. Quit. It’s never too late to reclaim your integrity.</p>

<content:encoded>It’s funny that the Government calls Social Security an “entitlement” like they are doing us such a big favor letting us have the money they forcibly took out of our wages all of our lives. When SS went into operation we were told we could have it back when we retire, and the Government COULD NOT take it or BORROW from it ever.<br/>
So what did they do? They STOLE it. They pillaged the funds, with an IOU of course but never payed it back.<br/>
NOW, it’s called “UNFUNDED ENTITLEMENTS???”
<p>Stealing people’s pensions is nothing new folks! Get used to it, or get angry!!!</p>

<content:encoded>In December 1955 I left the Netherlands to migrate to Australia.
<p>To do so I had to have a clearance from the Dutch taxation office.</p>
<p>I worked there and paid for my old age pension and I know that for sure because I made up the payroll.</p>
<p>In Australia I became a member of NESWA ( Netherlands Ex-serviceman and Women Organization ).</p>
<p>Since the Dutch Government refused to pay me I referred the case to that organization but they did not succeed.</p>
<p>The person who handled that resigned because he was frustrated.</p>
<p>Some people received a pension and others, under the same circumstances, were denied.</p>
<p>To this day I have received nothing and never will.</p>
<p>Because the Dutch government introduced a law that stated that people who left before July 1958 would not be entitled to receive their pensions.</p>
<p>This date was cunning, after 1958 not many people migrated.</p>
<p>So this article should be taken notice of.</p>
<p>Dutch government said: “Molon Labe”.</p>

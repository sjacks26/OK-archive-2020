<content:encoded>I have tried several times to contact the person in charge of the Utah chapter of Oath Keepers and have gotten no response!  It is my desire to be more active in the chapter but I cannot seem to get info on activities that the Oath Keepers are involved in.  Why is that?<br/>

<content:encoded>I really don’t want to appear as though I am some great teacher.  I am not.  I have discovered something about myself that I want to confess.  If this ends up sounding like I am teaching, it is only because I have had to teach myself this lesson and I and believe it is important.  It may appear to be so elementary but the application of this subject produces profound results.  It is being applied today and we are all caught up in it.<br/>
	I hate to beat around the bush.  I’m a ‘bottom line’ kind of guy so here is the subject.  It is all about conflict.  Conflict takes place between two opposing entities.  We are in conflict with an enemy so please make this personal.  There are two basic elements of warfare.  These are offense and defense.  What is so important about this?  Well, I think our enemy knows that our natural preponderance is to defend.  We, by our very nature, have the tendency to take that position in conflict.  This gives them a great advantage.  We are predictable in conflict.<br/>
	They, on the other hand, are attackers.  We are defenders and they are attackers.  We need to assign great importance to this fact because it has great significance as to how we should conduct our warfare and how they are conducting their warfare.  Know your enemy.  They are attackers.  I’m not even sure that defense is in their war bag.  I haven’t seen it.  Their tactic is always attack, attack, attack.  If their attack is not successful, they just slide over and attack somewhere else.  Hell of an offense, they have and very effective.<br/>
	What about defense?  Well, defense alone will not win a war.  Never has.  Defense can be used as a delaying tactic.  It can also cause the enemy to move to attack someplace else.  The ultimate effectiveness is when you can cause the enemy to stop forward movement for a prolonged period of time.  If that result is obtained, natural laws come into play and assist you in your cause.  The cessation of movement, by nature, creates a condition of stagnation, decay, disintegration and death.  The Gates of Vienna is a good example.  However, the best you can expect from defense is to cause the enemy to retreat.<br/>
	Here is the point to all of this.  The enemy is kicking our ass with this.  They know our response (if we respond at all) will be to defend.  Hopefully this is beginning to become clear to you because we are being duped into this on a daily basis.  If our only tactic is to defend, then we are going to continue to defend ourselves right into the FEMA camp or the grave.  We have to change and we are changing.  Our primary tactic has to be to attack.  Defense is important when the situation calls for it but attack is the only military tactic that creates victory.  Enemy retreat is not victory.  Enemy retreat is, at best, a form of armistice and we have to defeat these bastards.<br/>
	I think that Stewart has come to this realization and that is why we are conducting operations like Bundy Ranch, the mines and Ferguson.  No shots have been fired as of yet.  Nonetheless, we are beginning to attack.  With the Ferguson operation, we are attacking and I would like to expand on exactly what is taking place there.  So, once again, bear with me.  This is also, I believe, very important.  I’m am even going to go so far as to give this next section a title in the hopes that it will peak your interest to continue reading.<br/>
THE TOWER OF BABEL AND THE LOSS OF NATIONAL IDENTITY<br/>
	According to the Bible and other ancient writings, there was a time when all the people of Earth spoke the same language.  They may even have all been the same color at that time.  There is no known evidence of the color statement.  They all lived in what is termed the ‘cradle of civilization’.  There was this man named Nimrod who managed to convince at least most of the people to build this great tower.  Obviously he drew the people together for a great collective purpose.  Community action, if you will.  Evidently God took offense at this and He did something about it.  He gave the people different languages.  Supernatural event?  Looks like it to me.  Anyway, it obviously resulted in division among the people.  Had to be quite a shock to the people when this instantaneous occurrence happened.  Misunderstanding and mistrust occurred immediately among all the people.  What was their response to this?  They immediately set about to find commonality amongst themselves.  When a person found someone else who spoke the same language, they stuck together.  As this process continued, people formed groups and, when a sufficient number collected, they broke off from the others and separated themselves from the rest.  Thus, we have different races, ethnic groups, etc.  What’s the point here?  People seek identity with other people.  Separation into identity groups became a natural tendency for human beings.  Misunderstanding and mistrust for other groups was also a natural tendency.<br/>
	Time went on and nations were created.  Skipping the long history, I will get to the point of the matter.  National identity;   a battleground fully understood and exploited by our enemy.  If you can get the people of a nation to lose sight of their national identity, they will be forced to fall back on their next most comfortable source of identity.  These sources or places would be ethnic, racial, etc.  We know this is happening in America and we know the natural tendencies of humans on this matter.  This is perhaps the greatest tactic of progressive warfare against us.  How destructive can this be?  Well, it has divided the citizenry in every way possible.  Divide and conquer.  Right?<br/>
	So what should we do?  We know who is behind all of this but we are not getting to them.  They light the fires and then step back.  We come in and do our best to put out the fires.  Our efforts are being spent trying to put out the fires in order to heal our divisions.  We may manage to put out the flames but the embers remain and those may never go out completely.  We can hope.  Now I do not deny that we must endeavor to put out the flames but, in doing so, we have neither injured our enemy nor solved the national peril.  Our enemy keeps on lighting other fires (constant attacks) and we continue to respond by putting out the flames.  It becomes a vicious cycle that is orchestrated by them and all the while they laugh and say to each other ‘what busy bees they are’.<br/>
	Well, here I am once again, blazing this trail through the wilderness of chaos.  I stop to drop a marker and I look up ahead and who do I see?  I see Stewart up there.  When this happens, it gives me encouragement and confidence.  I know that he is on the right course because he is taking the same course as me.  I know that I’m on the right path because I am taking the same course as him.  You may not share a personal appreciation for that fact but I just think it’s so cool.<br/>
	The Ferguson operation is all about the one tactic that will ultimately defeat our enemy.  We have stepped in to help put out the flames but we have brought in the ultimate weapon.  That weapon is the Constitution and the application thereof that will remedy the situation.  What is the Constitution?  IT IS OUR NATIONAL IDENTY.  We are not Americans simply because of our address.  Hell, Obama lives in a big white house right in the middle of Washington D.C.  I would never call that man an American.  Would you?<br/>
We are a nation of deprived people.  We have not been taught about our national heritage.  This has been a deliberate action perpetrated upon us by our enemy.  The goal was to rob us of our national identity.  They knew full well what would transpire.  Having no national identity would force the people to fall back to a lesser identity where they could find comfort and safety.<br/>
	The tactic Oath Keepers are using in Ferguson reaches beyond the flames to cause injury to our enemy.  Just in case you haven’t noticed, we are kicking their ass in Ferguson.  Oath Keepers have sworn to protect and defend the Constitution but now we are going further.  Realizing that the Constitution is an awesome weapon in and of itself, we are transitioning from the tactical strategy of ‘defense only and always’ to a mighty offense that will change the course of this war.

<content:encoded>Hi Joseph,<br/>
Having joined OK only in June and attended no meetings, I too am frustrated by the lack of activity in what should be a very active chapter. One explanation (discovered recently) may be the atmosphere of intimidation, fear and doom Sheriff Gore projects over gun owners and conservatives in the county.<br/>
However, none of these intrigues need affect the rest of us OathKeepers of which there are many, many more than the official numbers suggest. My wife and I will be attending the upcoming meeting at the Warfighter Academy, Escondido on 26 Sep. You’re welcome to contact me directly if only for encouragement.

<content:encoded>Hi Michael,<br/>
    The “FIND A CHAPTER NEAR YOU” didm’t work – then, I clicked on “SELECT A STATE” and it WORKED fine.<br/>
    The POC (point opt contact) listed for your area is Karen Rynearson and her phone number is<br/>
(714) 604 – 3291. Before,  I left a message with her and she DID return my call. Thanks Karen!!!<br/>
    There is also an email address near her info., I am not sure it’s hers<br/>
The best of luck to ya Michael !!! ~~~ the Joe ~~~<br/>
    PS: Have you ever listened to Alex Jones?     He has a radio talk show out of Austin, TX.. VERY good program for patriots who care. Go to all of the pages that come up until you see a “Listen Now” button. Click on it and it should start playing on your PC’s radio. It is a continuous loop, of current news, that you can listen to ANYTIME. “Bookmark” or “Favorites” it if you like it. I’ve been a listener for 8 to 9 years – I highly recommend it.

<p>Having been relatively quiet for a while, Russia’s leader Vladimir, speaking in Sochi <em>(following meetings with Middle East crown princes who confirmed Russia as a key partner – “isolated”?)</em>, has unleashed his most aggressive statements with regard the failing world order:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>*PUTIN SAYS U.S. DOLLAR LOSING TRUST AS RESERVE CURRENCY</strong></li>
<li><strong>*PUTIN: WORLD WITHOUT RULES IS POSSIBILITY; ANARCHY GROWING</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Adding that the risk of major conflicts involving major countries is  growing, as well as the risk of arms control treaties being violated,  Putin exclaimed that the <strong>US-led unipolar world is like a dictatorship over other countries </strong>and that “<strong>US leadership brings no good for others</strong>,” and calls for a new global consensus.</p>
<p><a href="http://rt.com/news/198676-putin-uea-russia-nahyan/" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://rt.com/news/198676-putin-uea-russia-nahyan/', 'Having met Crown Prince Al Nahyan of Abu Dhabi in Sochi,');" target="_blank">Having met Crown Prince Al Nahyan of Abu Dhabi in Sochi,</a> who confirmed that <strong>Moscow “plays a very important role in the Middle East,”</strong> and added that he had no doubts that his country and Russia “are <strong>bound by a privileged relationship</strong>,” it appears Russia is less “isolated” than the West would have many believe.</p>

<p>Escalation?

<p><strong>Russian military provocations have increased so much over the  seven months since Moscow annexed Crimea from Ukraine that Washington  and its allies are scrambling defense assets on a nearly daily basis in  response to air, sea and land incursions by Vladimir Putin’s forces.</strong></p>
<p>Not only is Moscow continuing to foment unrest in Eastern Ukraine,  U.S. officials and regional security experts say Russian fighter jets  are testing U.S. reaction times over Alaska and Japan’s ability to  scramble planes over its northern islands — all while haunting Sweden’s  navy and antagonizing Estonia’s tiny national security force.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Russian military provocations have increased so much over the  seven months since Moscow annexed Crimea from Ukraine that Washington  and its allies are scrambling defense assets on a nearly daily basis in  response to air, sea and land incursions by Vladimir Putin’s forces.</strong></p>
<p>Not only is Moscow continuing to foment unrest in Eastern Ukraine,  U.S. officials and regional security experts say Russian fighter jets  are testing U.S. reaction times over Alaska and Japan’s ability to  scramble planes over its northern islands — all while haunting Sweden’s  navy and antagonizing Estonia’s tiny national security force.</p>
<p><strong>“What’s going on is a radical escalation of aggressive  Russian muscle flexing and posturing designed to demonstrate that Russia  is no longer a defeated power of the Cold War era,”</strong> says Ariel  Cohen, who heads the Center for Energy, National Resources and  Geopolitics at the Institute for the Analysis of Global Security in  Washington.</p>
<p><strong>“The more we retreat, the more we are encouraging Russia to behave in a more aggressive way,” </strong>Mr.  Cohen said. “We need to be engaging more deeply with our Central Asian  allies, but instead we are in the process of abandoning turf to Russia,  and it’s wrong — it’s against our interests geopolitically to let Russia  feel that they all of a sudden have won all the turf without firing a  shot.”</p></blockquote>

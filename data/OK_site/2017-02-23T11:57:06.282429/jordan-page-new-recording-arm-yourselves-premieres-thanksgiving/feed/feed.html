<content:encoded>gt, this is not aimed at you, but aimed at the people who do listen to music, etc most of the time.  Same as with the movie “Midnight Ride” which targets those who mostly watch movies.  
<p>Alll mediums are needed to spread the concept of Freedom, and that we are NOT victims unless we choose to be here in America.</p>
<p>Same for religion, we need Constitutional preachers to spread the word that God did not create them to be victems, but to defend themselves and their children.</p>
<p>All of it is important, for as you can tell from your own preferences that not all use the same medium for their information.</p>
<p>We all have our beliefs, but if we do not keep our legitimate government you will watch what they tell you to watch, listen to what they tell you to listen to, wear what they tell you to wear, work at what they tell you to work at, or you will be a unwilling medical test subject and/or die.</p>
<p>You have a choice BECAUSE of the US Constitution.  </p>
<p>It is important for you, me, us to all stand for, support all mediums to get that information across because it may lessen those “battles” for our nation this time for our not being “eternally vigilent” of those that serve within our governments.</p>
<p>We all are different, and that is good as it is our strength as a nation until that difference is magnified by lies that we are also opposed and enemies of/ to each other.  We all bring strengths and weaknesses to this.  But acceptance that not everyone is the same and allowing those differences as long as they do not harm another or another’s property is as much the bedrock of our nation as Separation of Powers is the foundation that sits upon that bedrock.  As is the natural rights of self defense, life, liberty from those serving within our governments intruding into our very lifes, that the general (federal) government is NOT delegated the authority to create laws that affect our everyday lives, etc.</p>
<p>George Washington in his Farewell Address: “It is important, likewise, that the habits of thinking in a free Country should inspire caution in those entrusted with its administration, to confine themselves within their respective Constitutional spheres; avoiding in the exercise of the Powers of one department to encroach upon another. The spirit of encroachment tends to consolidate the powers of all the departments in one, and thus to create whatever the form of government, a real despotism. The necessity of reciprocal checks in the exercise of political power; by dividing and distributing it into different depositories, and constituting each the Guardian of the Public Weal against invasions by the others, has been evinced by experiments ancient and modern; some of them in our country and under our own eyes. To preserve them must be as necessary as to institute them.”</p>
<p>It is our duty to preserve them.</p>
<p>James Madison, Federalist 14: “In the first place, it is to be remembered, that the general government is not to be charged with the whole power of making and administering laws. Its jurisdiction is limited to certain enumerated objects, which concern all the members of the republic, but which are not to be attained by the separate provisions of any”.</p>
<p>James Madison, Federalist 45: “The powers delegated by the proposed Constitution to the federal government are few and defined. Those which are to remain in the State governments are numerous and indefinite. The former will be exercised principally on external objects, as war, peace, negotiation, and foreign commerce; with which last the power of taxation will, for the most part, be connected. The powers reserved to the several states will extend to all the objects which, in the ordinary course of affairs, concern the lives, liberties, and properties of the people, and the internal order, improvement and prosperity of the State.”</p>
<p>Thomas Jefferson: “I believe the states can best govern our home concerns and the federal government our foreign ones.” </p>
<p>Thomas Paine: “Those who expect to reap the benefits of freedom, must, like men, undergo the fatigue of supporting it.” </p>
<p>Abraham Lincoln: “We, the people, are the rightful masters of both congress and the courts – not to overthrow the constitution, but to overthrow men who pervert the Constitution”.</p>
<p>James Madison, Federalist 57, wrote that Congress “can make no law which will not have its FULL operation on themselves and their friends, as well as on the great mass of the society.”</p>
<p>Yet we see everyday that those that serve in governmental positions doing just that.  A cop speeding while not on duty asks if stopped if “professional courtesy” is practiced by that department; those that serve within higher offices many times are given the pass for drunk driving, and other “small crimes” (and even larger ones); judges (back when the lawfully REQUIRED warrants were actually used were not charged and prosecuted for giving out blank warrants; those people working within elections committing fraud – even in front of LE’s, and nothing done; etc. </p>
<p>All of those “little” things assisted and created the openings into the destruction of our government from within.</p>
<p>All types of media must spread the word, wake up those still sleeping, give courage to those fearing.</p>

<content:encoded>Thank You, Jordan, for what you do!
<p>Music hits many people better then words at times. The USA needs all who are willing to support our legitimate government, to start to understand it.</p>
<p>God Bless!</p>

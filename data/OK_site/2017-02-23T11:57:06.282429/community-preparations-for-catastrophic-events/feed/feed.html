<content:encoded>It also needs to say and be impressed that individuals think beyond the moment about food and water. When an even prevents/ interrupts our food chain, it is up to individuals to be prepared as well. Not everyone needs or is going to  have a 20 years supply of beans, etc., but at least a week or two of water and food to sustain them. Not to is suicide. Remember, the Europeans were eating the babies during the “Little Ice Age.” I don’t want to be my neighbors next meal.

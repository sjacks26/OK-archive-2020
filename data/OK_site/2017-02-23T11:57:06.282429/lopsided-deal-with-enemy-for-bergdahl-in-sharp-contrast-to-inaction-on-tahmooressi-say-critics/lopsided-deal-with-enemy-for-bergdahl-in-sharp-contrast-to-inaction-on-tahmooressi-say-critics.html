<p>By <span>Joseph J. Kolb</span></p>
<p>The Obama administration’s extraordinary effort to free Army Sgt.  Bowe Bergdahl has some wondering why the president can’t make a simple  phone call on behalf of a former Marine being held in a Mexican prison  after mistakenly driving across the border with registered guns.</p>
<p>Obama announced Saturday in a dramatic Rose Garden news conference  that five Taliban prisoners from Guantanamo Bay would be exchanged for  Bergdahl, a 28-year-old infantryman held captive for five years by the  terrorist group. The swap angered many in the military and on Capitol  Hill, because it went against long-standing policy of not bargaining  with terrorists.</p>
<p>” … as far the Administration went for Bergdahl, Andrew Tahmooressi is  still stuck in a Mexican jail for making a wrong turn and the only  thing grabbing the President’s attention so far is an online petition  that forces him to respond.”</p>
<p>– Rep. Duncan Hunter, R-Calif.</p>
<p>“He wasn’t forgotten by his country, because the United States of  America does not ever leave our men and women in uniform behind,” Obama  said.</p>
<p>Although Tahmooressi is not a prisoner of war, he served two tours of  duty in Afghanistan, and now suffers post-traumatic stress disorder,  according to his mother, Jill Tahmooressi. Friends who have visited him  in prison say he has been tortured and threatened with rape and death,  and they question whether the administration is doing enough to help  him.</p>
<p>“This Administration went to unprecedented lengths for Bowe Bergdhal  by making a lopsided deal with an untrustworthy partner, even when there  other options still on the table that neither involved the Taliban nor  prisoners released from Guantanamo Bay,” said Rep. Duncan Hunter,  R-Calif. “Meanwhile, as far the Administration went for Bergdahl, Andrew  Tahmooressi is still stuck in a Mexican jail for making a wrong turn  and the only thing grabbing the president’s attention so far is an  online petition that forces him to respond.”</p>
<p>Mark Podlaski, who served with Tahmooressi in Afghanistan, told Fox  News in a phone interview if President Obama and Secretary of State John  Kerry “can give up five Taliban leaders for a ‘traitor’ why can’t they  make a phone call to Mexico to free a Marine who served honorably?</p>
<p>“I’ve never been this upset with my government.</p>
<p>“Tahmooressi gave his mind and body two times — referring to his two tours of duty in Afghanistan — for this country.”</p>
<p>Sam Vranicar, who also served with Tahmooressi in Afghanistan and  convinced him to go to California to receive treatment for post  traumatic stress disorder, echoed his comrades.</p>
<p>“It’s absurd how we can negotiate with terrorists in Afghanistan to  get back a deserter soldier, but we can’t negotiate with an ally in  Mexico to bring home a loyal and honorable combat veteran,” Vranicar  said. “All the monies spent on preventing and fighting terrorism, many  of the lives lost, have been in vain because of this ‘deal’ Obama made.”</p>
<p>Jill Tahmooressi declined to comment on any comparison between her  son’s plight and that of Bergdahl, saying only that she was sure his  family is grateful for his return</p>
<p>Hunter, a former Marine, was echoed by a former colleague in the House who served in the Army.</p>

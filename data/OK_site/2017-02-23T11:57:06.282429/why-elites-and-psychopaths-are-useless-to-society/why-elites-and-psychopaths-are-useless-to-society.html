<p>The ultimate and final goal of evil is to obscure and destroy our   very conception of evil itself, to change the inherent moral fiber of   all humanity until people can no longer recognize what is right and what   is wrong. Evil is not a wisp of theological myth or a simplistic   explanation for the aberrant behaviors of the criminal underbelly;   rather, it is a tangible and ever present force in our world. It exists   in each and every one of us. All men do battle with this force for the   entirety of our lives in the hope that when we leave this Earth, we  will  leave it better and not worse.</p>
<p>When evil manifests among organized groups of people in the halls of   power, power by itself is not always considered the greatest prize. The   true prize is to mold society until it reflects the psychopathy that   rots at the core of their being. That is to say, the elites, the   oligarchy, the mad philosopher kings want to make us just like they are:   proudly soulless. Only then can they rule, because only then will they   be totally unopposed.</p>
<p>The problem is humanity is not only hardwired with a dark side; we   are also hardwired with a conscience — at least, most of us are.</p>
<p>The vast studies of psychiatrist Carl Gustav Jung prove an in-depth   and intricate inborn set of principles common to every person,   regardless of time or place of birth and regardless of environmental   circumstances. In some circles we refer to this as “natural law.” All   people are born with a shared moral compass that is often expressed in   various religious works throughout the ages. It is a universal voice, or   guide, that we can choose to listen to or to ignore. Organized   psychopaths have struggled with the existence of this inborn compass for   centuries.</p>
<p>They have tried using force and fear. They have tried abusing our   natural inclinations toward family and tribalism. They have tried   corrupting the very religious institutions that are supposed to   reinforce our consciences and teach us nobility. They have tried   psychotropic substances and medications to paralyze our emotional center   and make us malleable. They have tried everything, and they have  failed  so far. How do I know they have failed? Because you are able to  read  this article today.</p>
<p>Two methods remain prominent in the arsenal of elites.</p>
<p><strong>Convince Good People To Do Evil In The Name Of ‘Good’</strong></p>
<p>This strategy is still effective, depending on the scenario   encountered. Elitists are very fond of presenting mind games to the   public (in TV, cinema, books, etc.), which I call “no-win scenarios.”   These games are hypothetical dilemmas that require the participant or   viewer to make a forced choice with only two options: The participant   can strictly follow his conscience, which usually means assured   destruction for himself and others; or he can bend or break the rules of   conscience in order to save lives and achieve a “greater good.”</p>
<p>Watch the propaganda tsunami in the show “24,” for example, and tally   how many times the hero is faced with a no-win scenario. Then tally  how  many times he ignores his moral imperative in order to succeed. The   message being sent is clear: Solid morality is not logical. Morality  is a  luxury for those who do not have to concern themselves with  immediate  survival. In other words, the world needs bad men to fight  other bad  men.</p>
<p>Of course, real life is not television; and there has never been nor   will there ever be a legitimate example of a no-win scenario. There are   no dilemmas that require good people to knowingly sacrifice conscience   or destroy innocent lives in order to succeed. There are no dilemmas   with only two available solutions. All social dilemmas are fluid, which   means that solutions are shifting, but infinite. Just because you  cannot  see the way out does not mean the way out does not exist. To  fight  monsters, we do not need to become monsters. Survival is  meaningless  unless we can prove ourselves worthy of life. This does not  mean one  should not fight back against evil. On the contrary, one  should always  fight back. But if we fight without a code of principles  and honor, then  we will have lost before the battle begins.</p>
<p><strong>Convince Good People That There Is No Such Thing As ‘Evil’ People</strong></p>
<p>Any action, no matter how horrifying, can be rationalized by the   intellectual mind or the mathematical mind. This is why we are born with   an emotional and empathic side to our natures. Those who embrace evil   often seek to soften their image through the use of cold   rationalization. They appeal to our desire to feel logically responsible   and to boost our intelligent self-image.</p>
<p>Some people might argue that the machinations of evil are  self-evident, and that philosophical examinations such as this are  unnecessary.  They would say that there is no need to reassert that the  works of psychopathy and elitism are fundamentally destructive, but they  would be wrong.  I was recently sifting through some mainstream  articles when I came across this jewel entitled <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/men/thinking-man/10788449/Why-psychopaths-are-more-successful.html" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.telegraph.co.uk/men/thinking-man/10788449/Why-psychopaths-are-more-successful.html', '“Why Psychopaths Are More Successful.” ');" target="_blank">“Why Psychopaths Are More Successful.” </a></p>
<p>The article summarizes the theories behind a new “science self-help book” entitled <em>The Good Psychopath’s Guide To Success</em>.   Co-author and Oxford psychology professor, Kevin Dutton, states that  he  “wanted to debunk the myth that all psychopaths are bad.” He wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>“I’d done research with the special forces, with surgeons,  with top  hedge fund managers and barristers. Almost all of them had  psychopathic  traits, but they’d harnessed them in ways to make them  better at what  they do.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Now, three important questions need to be asked of Dutton. First,   what exactly is his definition of success? Second, if such people are   “better” at what they do because of their psychopathic traits, who   exactly are they “better” than? Is he suggesting that a non-psychopath   could not be just as good a surgeon? Wouldn’t it be preferable to be   good surgeon <em>without</em> psychopathy, one who still cares about the   well-being of his patients rather than just his own success? And  third,  if a person can be accomplished in a field without abandoning  his  conscience as a psychopath does, what good is psychopathy to  anyone?</p>
<p>You see, elitist academics like Dutton are not interested in   answering such questions in an honest way because their goal is not   necessarily to outline a legitimate argument for the usefulness of   psychopaths. What they really want is to make psychopathy a morally   acceptable ideal in the mainstream.</p>
<p>Dutton does this by asserting the false notion that there are such   things as good psychopaths and bad psychopaths, thereby creating a   superficial dichotomy he essentially pulled from thin air. Dutton cites   several character traits <em>he</em> defines as being common to good psychopaths.</p>
<p><strong>Psychopath Volume Control: </strong>Dutton argues that a good   psychopath has the ability to turn up or turn down his level of   perceived empathy in order to avoid burning bridges with those around   him. What Dutton fails to mention (or just doesn’t understand) is that   this “volume control” is very common to the average psychopath. In fact,   psychopaths tend to be quite adept at reading the emotional states of   others and adapting to their moods to appear more human. This is how   psychopaths end up in marriages, with families and in positions of   respect in a community. This is how psychopaths become leaders.   Catastrophes arise, however, when the psychopath decides he is   comfortable enough that he no longer needs to hide his inability to feel   conscience or remorse. There is nothing special or good about a  morally  bankrupt person who happens to be good at disguise.</p>
<p><strong>Fearlessness:</strong> Dutton’s claim that psychopaths are   fearless is simply absurd and is not based in any practical psychology   that I know of. Psychopaths are afraid all of the time. What they fear   most is losing what they believe belongs to them. This could be money,   power or even unlucky people caught in their web. This fear might drive   them to take risks in order to accomplish certain goals. But let’s be   clear: Only those who take risks because they <em>love</em> what they do have truly overcome fear. Psychopaths are incapable of true love.</p>
<p><strong>Lack Of Empathy:</strong> This is the root of the movement   toward rationalized moral relativism — the argument that empathy gets in   the way of success and sometimes gets in the way of the “greater  good.”  Dutton claims that lack of empathy gives the psychopath focus,  making  him skilled in high-pressure situations. In a hostage situation,  he  says, he would much rather have a psychopath as his negotiator. Of   course, he does not consider that his captors would likely be the same   kinds of psychopaths he so praises in his book.</p>
<p>One would conclude by reading Dutton’s position that high-pressure   jobs require a lack of empathy. And of course, the jobs with the highest   pressure are those in political and military leadership. The  philosophy  of applying positive assumptions to psychopathic qualities  is the  highest dream of the elite. If you and I could be convinced to  see their  gruesome behavior as fully necessary to the greater good,  then they  will have ascended to a place beyond accountability. They  become like  the old gods of Olympus, dealing death and destruction  above the  judgment of mere mortals; and we will have handed them that  godhood.</p>
<p><strong>Self-Confidence:</strong> I think Dutton is confused over the   difference between confidence and narcissism. The average psychopath  is  often self-obsessed, which means he is willing to do anything to get   what he wants. This drive might be impressive, but it is not a product   of the kind of self-awareness required to gain real self-confidence. A   parasitic tick is not necessarily self-confident when he digs into the   flesh of a dog; all he knows is that he desperately wants the blood   underneath.</p>
<p><strong>A Kingdom Of Psychopaths</strong></p>
<p>In his collected writings entitled “The Undiscovered Self,” Jung   theorized according to his work with hundreds of patients that some 10   percent of the human population at any given time has latent   psychopathic characteristics, with a much smaller percentage living as   full-fledged psychopaths. He surmised that this latent psychopathy will   often stay hidden or unconscious for most people, unless their social   environment becomes unstable enough to bring out their darker side.</p>
<p>The purges in the early days of communist Russia and Stalinism, for   example, brought out the very worst in many normally harmless citizens.   Neighbor turned against neighbor, and betrayal for personal gain became   the norm. The collectivist hive became an incubator for psychopaths.   What Dutton’s psychopathic success theory does not take into account is   the fact that America, and much of the world today, is becoming a   breeding ground for morally bankrupt people. That is to say, our society   is now designed by psychopaths for psychopaths, and only psychopaths   could succeed in such an environment. We are all being encouraged to   become more psychopathic, more evil, in order to survive and thrive.</p>
<p>The destruction unleashed by the psychopathy of elitism far outweighs   any potential benefits that might arise from their uncompromising  brand  of ingenuity. Anything these freaks of the psyche might  accomplish can  be accomplished with far less physical and moral cost by  those with  self-discipline and a love of their fellow man. I would be  willing to  wager any power monger that if he and his miscreant  organizations were  to disappear, humanity would leap forward in strides  never before seen.  Ultimately, those who embrace evil and those who  elevate psychopathy are  not the key to the betterment of the world;  they are obstacles to the  betterment of the world.</p>

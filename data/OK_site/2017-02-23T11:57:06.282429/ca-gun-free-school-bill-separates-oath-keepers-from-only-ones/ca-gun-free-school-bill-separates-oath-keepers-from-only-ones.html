Portrait: State of California / Quote: “Animal Farm” by George Orwell</p></div>
<p>“We applaud the California Assembly today for passing SB 707, priority legislation of the California chapters of the Brady Campaign that will help keep concealed, loaded guns off of California university and college campuses and K-12 school grounds,” the Brady Campaign stated in <strong><a href="http://yubanet.com/california/Op-Ed-Peggy-McCrum-Brady-Campaign-applauds-CA-Assembly-for-passing-SB-707-to-keep-concealed-guns-off-school-grounds.php" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://yubanet.com/california/Op-Ed-Peggy-McCrum-Brady-Campaign-applauds-CA-Assembly-for-passing-SB-707-to-keep-concealed-guns-off-school-grounds.php', 'a Sept. 1 press release');" target="_blank">a Sept. 1 press release</a></strong>. “We call on Gov. Jerry Brown to sign the legislation to protect our students.”</p>
<p>That’s hardly surprising.  When the antis talk about “common sense gun safety laws,” what they really mean is citizen disarmament, with “bearing arms” reserved exclusively for agents of the monopoly of violence. They want law enforcement personnel to be the “Only Ones” with guns, and they rely on oath-breaking cops to make sure their will is enforced.</p>
<p>For those new to the term, it’s something I’ve been using for years, not to bash all cops, but to illustrate when those of official status, rank or privilege, both in law enforcement and in some other government position, get special breaks not available to we commoners, particularly (but not exclusively) when they’re involved in gun-related incidents. It had its genesis in a video of a DEA agent telling a roomful of school children he was<strong> </strong><strong><a href="http://www.thesmokinggun.com/documents/bizarre/dea-agent-foot-shoot-suit" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.thesmokinggun.com/documents/bizarre/dea-agent-foot-shoot-suit', '“the only one … professional enough” to carry a gun');" target="_blank">“the only one … professional enough” to carry a gun</a></strong>, and who then shot himself in the foot trying to holster his weapon.</p>
<p>Over the years, without even intending to, and most of the time based on reader tips, I’ve amassed quite a  <strong><a href="http://waronguns.blogspot.com/search?q=%22Only+Ones%22" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://waronguns.blogspot.com/search?q=%22Only+Ones%22', 'collection of news accounts');" target="_blank">collection of news accounts</a></strong> that directly contradict the gun-grabber contention that police are the “only ones” moral and capable enough to be trusted with guns. A while back, <a href="../sf-sheriff-highlights-only-ones-hypocrisy/index.html" target="_blank"><strong>an article of mine </strong></a>published by Oath Keepers pointed out the arrogant hypocrisy of a political top-level LEO who has proven himself both untrustworthy <em>and</em> committed to keeping you disarmed while he keeps his guns.</p>
<p>Equally unsurprisingly, politically-motivated discrimination was a transparently unconstitutional pot-sweetener built into SB 707, in order to gain support from the retired police officer lobby: They <strong><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dennis-santiago/californias-sb-707-gun-co_b_8120376.html" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dennis-santiago/californias-sb-707-gun-co_b_8120376.html', 'will be exempt from the new law');" target="_blank">will be exempt from the new law</a></strong>. It will only apply to us mundanes, and that includes retired military — sorry guys, thank you for your service, but you’re just not considered “qualified.” The ex-cops are good with that as long as they get theirs, and the hell with any pretense of equal protection.</p>
<p>And while <strong><a href="http://forbes.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=166212" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://forbes.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=166212', 'NRA joined');" target="_blank">NRA joined</a></strong> with <strong><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1996/09/16/us/fraternal-order-of-police-to-endorse-clinton.html" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.nytimes.com/1996/09/16/us/fraternal-order-of-police-to-endorse-clinton.html', 'anti-gun cop organizations');" target="_blank">anti-gun cop organizations</a></strong> like the Fraternal Order of Police and the International Union of Police Associations to cheer on the “<strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_Enforcement_Officers_Safety_Act" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_Enforcement_Officers_Safety_Act', 'Law Enforcement Officers Safety Act');" target="_blank">Law Enforcement Officers Safety Act</a></strong>” permitting nationwide concealed carry for “qualified” LEOs and retired LEOs, some of us were asking since when does someone with a seat at an exclusive banquet worry about the people who don’t rate an invitation?</p>
<p>Here are a few questions for those who consider themselves to be “peace officers” first:</p>
<p>If a citizen who was not threatening anyone in any way let you know they were peaceably keeping and bearing arms without a permit, would you arrest them?</p>
<p>If the answer is “Yes,” how is that consistent with your oath?  How does that not make you an “Only One”?</p>

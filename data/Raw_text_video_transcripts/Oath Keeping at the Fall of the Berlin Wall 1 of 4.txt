## Stewart Rhodes; Guenter Spens

SR: We’re in Dallas, Texas, talking to Guenter. What’s your last name?

GS: Spens

SR: Show me your ID again for a second. GS was an Eastern German Lt. Col. Correct? In the E German army.

GS: Correct.

SR: Show them, zoom in on that and he’ll tell us about his ID.

GS: This is an ID, Army ID. This is the E German Republic emblem. It wasn’t really a republic, but we called it one. The symbol means, this is the farmer, they have intelligence, and the hammer symbolized the war god. The idea was all are together in one republic. At least it was called this.

SR: That was the name, right.

GS: In German, this means German Democratic Republic. It was very prepared, because always Germans do the same. It is prepared to have more pictures in it.

SR: That’s you.

GS: That is me. When it changed, you just tear it out and put the next one in. (0:01:21.4) Everything about the Army, about me, is here. For example, you need license for special technics to drive certain cars, everything is in the same document.

SR: Let me look at your picture again. How old were you when that picture was taken?

GS: It was taken in May 89. In 89, I have to calculate, I was 36.

SR: Right. At that time you were a lt. col.?

GS: Yes. You cannot see it here. Just a moment, let me find it. It was a long time ago. The base was in Leipzig. Here it is. I became Major, and this date I became lt. col.

SR: Okay, I was just curious.

GS: We have this nice part here.

SR: Show them that.

GS: This means the following. When you’re in the field, you take it and put it like this.

SR: It’s like a dog tag.

GS: Yes. When you are not lucky, and you’re gone, someone will break the second part. The numbers are on both, and give it back to some officer so they know you are gone. You keep the other half so people can identify you.

SR: So there was no name on there, just a number.

GS: No name, just DDR, German Democratic Republic. There was different armies in the East, and your number. It’s metal. It was very well organized. (0:04:04.3)

SR: You were telling us about how the officer corps changed. You had gone to university first.

GS: Yes. When the Army was created, everything should look very well from the documents because it was shortly after WW2. Nothing should say Nazi or Wehrmacht or anything else.

SR: They tried to purge all that out of the military.

GS: Yes. The documents were very clear. Normally, all the documents in E Germany were very clear. But it was nothing for the party. The party was always right.

SR: You were telling us that you were given instructions, because they were trying to purge out the Nazi history and actions. You were given instructions about refusing orders that violated international law.

GS: Yes. In the service regulation it was clearly written, you have to not obey orders in two cases. First, if it’s against the Constitution. Second, if it’s against common international law. It was clearly written and you never could take it out. But actually, they make [garbled] so everything will work, it looks good. You can show the documents, it’s all fine.

SR: Right. We have a constitution. But the party ran out everything.

GS: (0:05:33.3) You could see this in 1968, we call it the Spring of Prague, revolution in Czechoslovakia. The Red Army invaded Czechoslovakia and required our army to join them, and the army did. But at this time, a lot of the officers were new and the father – I was 16 at this time. My boss, the colonel, was 18 at this time, not yet in the army, but his father was a colonel.

SR: 1968?

GS: Yes. And he disappeared. He was completely, a lot of officers were completely against it. We have our service regulation, we have the constitution, we can never do this.

SR: They were against going into Czechoslovakia.

GS: (0:06:42.0) And therefore against the party.

SR: They didn’t feel they had any authority to invade Czechoslovakia.

GS: Absolutely not. It was correct because we had our regulation.

SR: What did that regulation say?

GS: The regulation said we have to not obey the order when it is against the Constitution, against international law. The constitution says clearly that the army is only to defend our people. And it’s not defending our people to invade Czechoslovakia. 

SR: Right

GS: So it was pretty clear. And everyone knows the Constitution, because you learned in school.

SR: So they taught you the constitution in school.

GS: Absolutely. It was one of the first things in school we learned. Everyone knows the constitution. Here it should be the same, actually. But it isn’t.

SR: But what happened to the officers who said they didn’t like it.

GS: At this time, the party had absolute power. People just disappeared, it was that easy. There was no way to do anything, just disappear.

SR: So your commander’s father was disappeared.

GS: Yes. And a lot of others too. I didn’t know this at the time because I wasn’t in the army, I was 16, still in school. I realized what was going on, Czechoslovakia did not realize. Later I understood more in the army, because of my boss and everyone in the army, a lot of guys came back from Czechoslovakia still in the army, so they knew what happened.

SR: What did they say?

GS: (0:08:36.5) They said it was a disaster. Fortunately, they did not shoot anyone there. The Russians did. In my opinion, the Russian needed alibis, so they needed the army. They didn’t do anything, they were just there and out.

SR: That was their justification.

GS: Yes.

SR: What do you mean by that? How did it help them justify?

GS: It should never happen because it was against the constitution, against the oath. It was just the power of the party, nothing else, no right, nothing. The party had the power and used the power, against any documents. The law in E Germany was not bad. It was clear. But it was only [garbled] when you do something else and you follow the party. When the party wanted to do anything, they just did it. Because they said we are always right.

SR: In other words, it looked good on paper

GS: Absolutely

SR: (0:09:49.7) But in application it didn’t limit the party’s power. They did whatever they wanted to do.

GS: No. It was just one power, the party.

SR: And all the judges would do whatever they said.

GS: Of course, because it was good for you.

SR: So the judges were in the party too.

GS: Yes

SR: Now you said all officers had to belong to the party as well.

GS: Yes. All army officers had to belong to the party. When my deputy, he came from the university with just training in the army, he was not in the party. 4 weeks later he was. 

SR: But you said, it’s interesting to know. When the first wave of officers, when the country was young, was different than later on.

GS: Yes. The reason was, when they created the army, the party tried to keep control in the hands of all armed forces. Not just the army, there was also security. 

SR: You said youth and security right?

GS: Yeah. It was a lot. They tried to keep control over it. When they started the army, they could not take any Nazi, no officer from the Wehrmacht.

SR: Right. So they purged out the old officer corps.

GS: Yes. Some of them, you took them because you needed them, but under control. Most officers became officers for nothing, no education. The only reason for them was they were tending to the party, they were dependent on the party because when you have no education you cannot make your own life. If someone helps you, you are dependent. So this was the start of the army, of the officers. But technology, new weapons systems, the guys getting old, so the army must change. The next generation of officers – me and some years before – had a good education in the army or in the civilian university. We came to the training, it was a new generation of army officers. It changed really. We had to have some of the older guys. It was incredible. All they had in mind was this is my party, I’m nothing without my party.

SR: So you came from the university first. So they had to recruit more intelligent people, or more well-educated people. They had to tap into people who had already been in university. So you had a different mindset.

GS: (0:12:36.1) Yes. University or the military academy. Everyone had a good education. Education in Germany was elite. This changed completely, everyone was dependent on the party, okay we have to be in the party. The part I had in the army, it was organized inside the army with the organization of the party. They had control over them. For 2 years, they put me as a secretary on top of it. The problem was all the guys, it was about 30 men, all of us, my soldiers, we had 5 people that were working for the party as contractors. They were not in the party, but dominated completely by my soldiers. I used this to [garbled] a lot of them what was against our constitution. Because the party just said you have to make some good, but we need this. I said no.

SR: What’s that?

GS: When decision must be done by the party, it should look like democracy (0:14:06.2). You have to have your hand like yes. Everyone did this, of course. It was always the same. We did not. We discussed this. He did not like this, not that much. Then the situation in E Germany was getting worse and worse, in all countries of E Germany.

SR: You mean the economic situation?

GS: Yes. It started, it was really clear with Reagan, because he pushed there, and the E armies had to do the same, to keep balance. The first that couldn’t follow was Romania. He said not possible. The Russians put this part to increase the military

<content:encoded>I’m in south west oklahoma. Ex army. I am looking to join the team. Give me a date and time and I’ll be there. My oath still stands firm. The constitution is our rock. We must uphold it from all enemies. Foreign and DOMESTIC. I’m awake. If there is a group ready to fight for God, family, country anywhere near me please let me know. If not I’ll drive to okc till we can get a chapter started here as well. Molon labe!

<content:encoded>Hi, I’m a student at the University of Oklahoma. This organization caught my attention by its degree of professionalism and conviction in its role of providing security at the Sugar Pine mine. I have no military or law-enforcement background, but believe in the cause and would like to be involved.

<content:encoded>Greetings fellow Patriots! It’s awesome to see so many in the NE Ok. area who share in this passion to organize. I’ve been searching for a group to join &amp; have searched Militia sites &amp; such, but it seems they all share a common problem; poor leadership and organization. Now, more than ever, the need for BOTH is great. I feel 2016 is going to be the year of reckoning; as long as we are under the present administration, we need to be ready. I have never had the honor of serving in the military, but am willing and able to serve my country in whatever capacity needed to protect &amp; secure the Constitution and the Bill of Rights. I live in Delaware County &amp; am looking forward to joining forces with you all. I will be sending this message as an email to Falloutmedic for more info. Godspeed, and God Bless!

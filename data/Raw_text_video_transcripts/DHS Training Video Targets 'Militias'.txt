A training-style video available on a media page of the FEMA HSEEP (Homeland Security Exercise and Evaluation Program) website, and linked to the Department Of Homeland Security features a fake news report depicting "gunowners" and "militias" as terrorists planning bombing attacks on public centers.  While confirming that a similar video's source was indeed a FEMA/DHS webpage (it was), I discovered another video which pushes the boundaries even further; depicting a raid on a militia headquarters which turns up "evidence" of a chemical weapons factory, as well as schematics of various civilian targets.

As of the date this video was posted, it was available for download on the the FEMA HSEEP website, linked to a DHS.gov subsection.  The exact date when this video was produced is not clear.  Here are the original links (Video is listed as "Video News Raid"):

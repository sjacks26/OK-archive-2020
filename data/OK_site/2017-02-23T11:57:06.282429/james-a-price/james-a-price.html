<p><strong>Testimonial</strong>: My name is James A. Price, and I am proud to say that I am a new member of the Oath Keepers. I am a honorably discharged veteran of the U.S. Army. While stationed in Kirchgoens, Germany, I deployed to the Middle East to participate in what would become Operation Desert Storm.  Though I thought of myself as a common soldier just doing my job, my commanders saw fit to provide me with a Bronze Star among other awards for my service. Opting to put family time over a career in the military, I left active service after one enlistment. However, there is and always has been a big part of me that missed and craved the structure and discipline of the military lifestyle. Channeling that energy, I have gone on to complete graduate school earning my MBA and a position on the corporate staff of a global organization. My current position still finds me in service of others as my job consists of minimizing or eliminating adverse effects of our business operations on the environment as well as taking steps to ensure a safer workplace for our men and women.</p>
<p>As I look around, I cannot help but be completely outraged over the direction this country seems to be headed. I believe it is an insult to our Founding Fathers, the men and women that have worn the uniform in defense of it, and those that choose to call it home. They deserve better! Bickering politicians, their personal agendas, and a lot of help from the Political Correctness Police are threatening to fray the very fabric that holds this great nation together. For quite some time, I have plodded along feeling completely incapable of initiating anything to bring about significant change. As one individual, there is a certain amount of truth to that. After recalling that old saying, “There is strength in numbers,” I realized the answer isn’t me. It is WE. That is when my search for like-minded individuals began, which led me to Oath Keepers.</p>

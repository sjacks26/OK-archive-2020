BM: Thanks to everyone for coming. I thought I was all cried out this morning (0:00:41.4). I don’t think I’ll make it through this without a little bit more, so I’m not gonna look at you for a while, Vanessa. I want to make a few quick points. Stewart Rhodes has done a great job, an incredibly honorable and valuable ideal and organization like the OK. God bless you for standing up and taking heat (0:01:13.4). Somebody’s got to. Sheriff Richard Mack, thanks for being here.

BM: For those who don’t know me, I live in Tucson. I got involved in politics (0:01:40.0) almost exactly 2 years ago. I was active duty for more than 10 years, I fly the A-10 now in reserves. I took an oath to the Constitution, it does mean something significant. I really appreciate the 10 tenets of the OK. It basically comes down to, we’re not going to turn our guns and our violence and our ability to create violence against the people, citizens, fellow Americans, who we are here to protect (0:02:15.0). There can be no more valid or moral calling, or oath to take than that. Being involved in politics, you deal with the whole political spectrum. But there are times in politics where it pays politicians or political operatives to keep their opinions to themselves and stick a finger in the wind and go where the wind blows. (0:02:51.5) But there are times when it does not matter, when a situation comes up when it’s so egregious where you cannot sit by and allow even pressure from within your own ranks to keep you silent. This is one of those issues. To all of you apologists out there who are using the propaganda of the media and of the messaging and internal leaks from inside law enforcement. I stand with Stewart and say this is not criticism at that person, those men who wanted to make it home to see their families that night (0:03:38.7). This is against the policy, that they should never have been in. It is up to us, all of us, to hold our government officials and law enforcement officials accountable. When mistakes are made, they must be answered. (0:03:57.1) Criticism be damned. In an America that allows this event to go unanswered is not an America worth defending. I’ll say it again. An America, a state, a community that allows an event like this to go unanswered, uncriticized, unexamined, isn’t worth defending. (0:04:29.3)

BM: We as individuals, as part of a larger society, we learn lessons. We learn how to behave, how to approach authority, how to react in the face of authority. I want to draw a parallel to pre-9/11. If we had been on a plane that had been hijacked, we would have acted the same way the people on those planes did (0:05:14.6). We were conditioned, we were told it is best to be pacifists, best to sit by, best to let the State Department negotiate from whatever tarmac in South America you end up in. Because this will cause the least amount of damage (0:05:31.0). On 9/11/2001, we learned otherwise. Now, everyone in this room is someone who would become unruly on a plane, to the point of threatening the safety of that plane, every one of you would be part of a group effort to subdue the threat (0:05:49.9).

BM: Come forward to 2011. What happened to Vanessa’s family (0:05:59.1) is not new in this country. But it has hit home here, it happened in our backyard. With the proliferation of armed gangs and criminal consorts that pose as law enforcement and do these home invasions. Now we see the propensity of our own law enforcement to engage in the same tactics. I ask you, if you know that whoever is coming through your door is going to be shooting, what choice do you have, father, mother? (0:06:42.0) The tactics employed here do not advance peaceable negotiations. They simply up the ante. We are now in a catch-22 unlike we’ve been in before. The actions here have consequences not just to this family, but to all of us. Do not buy the messaging coming out of wherever it’s coming from. This message isn’t to us in the room, but whoever is watching this. They’re going to drag Jose Guerena’s name through the mud. There is a time-honored principle in this country, we’ll see who really thinks it’s more than just words (0:08:04.1). Those are 4 little words: innocent until proven guilty.

## I’m having trouble reconciling this with OK response to Black Lives Matter and police killings of those folks.

BM: When you hear the propaganda come out that Jose was a bad guy, that was guilty or a criminal. It doesn’t matter if he were. That is no slight to you or your husband, miss. This is a fellow Tucsonian who never had his day in court. It doesn’t matter if it would have eventually been shown in court, it does not matter what evidence they have. When you hear people say that, oh but he was a bad guy, oh but we have overwhelming evidence, oh but we thought he was armed and dangerous. That is not correct, it is immoral, it will only lead to further tragedies. (0:09:02.7)

BM: My final point is this. We gather here on Memorial Day. If you ask 100 members of the military why did they sign up to fight, what are they doing, 99 out of 100 will say I’m doing it to defend freedom. That’s their motivation (0:09:31.7). It is up to us to maintain a society and culture and government that is worthy of their defense. It is up to us to maintain a government that acknowledges and values our liberty. Without that, Jose Guerena’s death is in vain. Without that, the service of every member of the military is in vain. I ask us all to refocus. The most recently fatherless family in Tucson, it’s not the result of a crime syndicate, at least not an illegal one, it’s a result of wayward policy and lazy citizenry. I ask us all to do our part going forward to stand by Vanessa. And to ask hard questions (0:11:03.6) that need to be asked, not make apologies, to make ourselves and our preconceived notions, to be comfortable. I thank you for spending your Memorial Day to memorialize Jose Guerena who did not get his day in court.

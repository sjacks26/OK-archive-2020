<content:encoded>Look at the photograph. Sen. Lindsey Graham and Sen. John McCain are not old style Republicans or conservatives. Sen. Thom Tillis of NC needs to be careful about with whom he has his picture taken. Thom Tillie is not setting any conservative records either. “Birds of a feather.” That’s my opinion.

<content:encoded>A few days ago, I watched on television a story where a homeless chef, unemployed, was greatful that a large American city was allowing he and many other homeless citizens, a small parking lot to set up sheds and tents for them to live in.  A shed and tents for christ sake!  Heat and plumbing weren’t mentioned.  How many were veterans of this nation also wasn’t mentioned but, it isn’t a far stretch to imagine that some of these homeless citizens were veterans.  This out of work Chef who was being interviewed was accompanied by his wife and son in this new homeless camp.  My point is; one billion additional dollars for refugees?  I have a suggestion for our country’s political elite.  Why don’t we assist the “refugees” we have dwelling on the streets of America?  Why don’t we ask for and use that billion dollars for our fellow citizens before attempting to save the world and invite potential terrorists into our country?  Why is it so easy for politicians to procure dollars for foreigners but not for our fellow citizens?  Why does an American family have to live in a wooden box or tent while refugees are placed in apartments and houses provided by our government using the tax dollars of this family, ironically, in housing that they themselves can’t afford to live in.  We Americans are tired of the explanations of our politicians.  We are tired of seeing homeless citizen populations increase while billions are spent welcoming hundreds of thousands of foreigners into the country.  We are simply tired of the politics.  This country must find a way to place the value of her citizens above the politics of the world or we are going to witness anarchy not seen in a very long time.

<content:encoded>Add this to it also (from down the article a bit)
<p>“The federal government pays World Relief and agencies like it nearly $2,000 for every foreign refugee they resettle in the U.S.”</p>
<p>Now you know that it is those very same scum representatives who were involved in (or allowed to continue) Free Trade/NAFTA/CAFTA/ETC where they not so freely PAID corporations to move their business to foreign nations, and are now using what little is left of our money to import illegals and destroy the USA from within. (They are NOT refuge, as refuges ask for asylum, not invade.)</p>
<p>Figure out how many “foreign refugee they resettle in the U.S” they have paid for, not including the “illegal aliens Social Security cards and three years of back-payments through the Earned Income Tax Credit, even though they never paid taxes in the first place”; adding to that those that serve within our government “issuing work permits to illegal aliens and giving them each $25,000 in U.S. taxpayer money”, giving themhomes and places to live while Americans are homeless, etc that they were (back when they were whining about the government shutdown), and still are spending.  </p>
<p>Now figure out how many Americans, specifically veterans and families, that they deliberately made homeless.  Add to these figures the corporate welfare still going on that is still higher then whatelfare for the general public is.  </p>
<p>All of that could have/can be Grant money for AMERICAN business start ups.  That could have been the hand-up to people who lost those jobs and homes to restart and re\build America – most of them had some type of skill, even if it was cooking and setting tables that could be businesses that hire people.</p>
<p>These peopel who serve within our government, WE are allowing them to do this to us.  WE are NOT enforcing the US Constitution, state Constitutions, or any laws in Pursuance thereof the US Constitution. WE are not defending our borders as the US Constitution requires of us.  WE are not removing those TRAITORSfrom office and PROSECUTING them at every level of government – state and general.</p>
<p>Our country is falling, are we going to actually start assiting in stopping the fall?  Our founders gave us the “tools”; the Miliita, which is us; the Grand Jury and Grand Jury Investigations which we call forth; and the clause requiring that all judges use *”Good Behaviour” while in office or be removed, and jury trials; Free and Fair Elections; States can create money backed by silver and gold, and our money is supposed to be the same.</p>
<p>(Question, can we take everything those that serve within our governments have accumulated since their “service” began for the failure to keep, or put back, the money system as the “contract” theya re udner requries?  That would include those that did serve and no longer are, yet did not do their duty to the people as required?  If so, that would help alleviate some of the problems ongoing today.)  </p>
<p>Graham is a Traitor to the American people, the US Constitution, and the USA.</p>
<p>This is up to us.  We are running out of time.</p>

<content:encoded>I can’t stomach Jesse Ventura, going out of his way to sue the widow of Chris Kyle. Just not even right!<br/>
I will not listen to a word from his mouth.. I wouldn’t piss on him if he was on fire.

<content:encoded>Where I come from, they actually teach us how to spell and use proper grammar! And yes, I think over 160+ kills qualifies as a hero. Even if Chris had lied, to sue a widow during the trial of her husband’s murderer is truly despicable and the work of a sack of excrement.

<content:encoded>While I’m a newbie here, I’m no newbie to war or hostilities. After reading your response I felt rather insulted! I can picture you as one of the hippies running up to the national guard members and putting flowers in the muzzles of their rifles and singing a rousing rendition of kum-by-ya! You also elude to the Holy Spirit but in small letters which I find interesting. If you truly understand the Spirit and mindset of God, you’d understand that He is just not about love. He is also about forgiveness yes but also; vengeance, anger, wrath and that little mentioned word; sin. In my experience, this vet is simply expressing anger and NOT ego as you assert.

<content:encoded>Totally agree with your comments! After what this bum has done and is doing to the Kyle family, I will NEVER watch any video or read anything he posts. And if this organization, the Oathkeepers, endorses him, I will withdraw my support.

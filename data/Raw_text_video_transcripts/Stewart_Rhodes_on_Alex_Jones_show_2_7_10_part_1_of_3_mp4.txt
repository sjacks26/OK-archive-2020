Alex Jones: [00:00:00] We talk a lot about solutions here. And if tyranny comes to your door, it will come in a uniform. that's what officer Jack McLamb and many others have called for for a long time. Stewart Rhodes, Army paratrooper, one of Ron Paul's chief staffers in Congress, is with us for the balance of the show. We're going to go over the 10 orders They will not obey. But I want to ask the military police something. do you think America is about censorship. Do you think it's about Web sites being shut down. Do you think it's about talk radio being restricted. We have a corrupt government run by the same private banks worldwide that are doing unconstitutional things all over the place. Stewart Rhodes I mean you came in here today in the middle of a major major typhoon of tyranny. The House passes a cybersecurity bill. The bill clearly restricts free speech, net IDs to get online, NSA running the Internet, taking over all the infrastructure. What do you think about this major attack from China to Australia to Italy and to many ISPs in the U.S. Banning infowars dot.com and prison planet dot com, simultaneously as the UN calls for censorship, as the White House calls for it. As Time magazine calls for it. they all call for it this week and suddenly this happens. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:01:21] Well they know that the strongest weapon we have is our free speech and the Internet. since the printing press is the most powerful weapon they're trying to close it down. It's more important than than the Second Amendment too frankly. right right to speech is more important the right to bear arms. T. 

Alex Jones: [00:01:36] He pen is mightier than the sword. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:01:37] Oh absolutely. So they're trying to shut it down. 

Alex Jones: [00:01:39] You bet. My whole issue is people better get hopping mad and upset about this or or or we're going to become like like China. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:01:49] Right. You have no recourse but to arms. You can't communicate and associate. That's one of our core liberties, freedom of association. 

Alex Jones: [00:01:55] What did Kennedy say and those that make peaceful revolution impossible make violent revolution inevitable. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:02:00] That's right. You have no other recourse. 

Alex Jones: [00:02:03] I just can't believe this is happening globally to us right now. I mean this is a global regime. Look at this article right here. Read that headline out of the major newspaper of Australia. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:02:16] Six of the top anchors. Right. 

Alex Jones: [00:02:18] And it says 24 top private and government bankers are meeting to set the course of the world secretly in Australia right now. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:02:25] And in years past you would even know about that. You would only have the mainstream media, the four or five networks that tell you what's going on. You would even do it even though it's taking place on news and you know it's taking place right now because of the Internet. 

Alex Jones: [00:02:37] All right let's shift gears to the other takeovers right now. Stewart Rhodes, ex paratrooper, disabled vet, firearms instructor, former Ron Paul staff member, Yale Law grad, research scholar in Montana Nevada lawyer. Stewart has written for Gary Spencer's the warrior, for more liberty dot org. He writes the enemy at the gate column for SWAT Magazine and is writing a book on the dangers of applying the laws of war to the American people in a war on terror. And it goes on. 

Alex Jones: [00:03:08] Look we have Obama setting up a puppet governorship of 10 governors. They picked the MIAC Governor Nixon of Missouri who said returning vets and gun owners and libertarians the number one threat of the country. We know this is all really for us. That's why what a year ago or so you formed oath keepers now with chapters tens of thousands all over the country. STEWART What are we facing right now. And why did you start oath keepers. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:03:32] Well I think we're facing the very very scary window as you said before is a window of crisis, intensely created. Their goal is to shut down and destroy our republic. But in this window it's a two way window we have we have an opportunity as well. But the whole goal of Oath Keepers is to buy more time. If I can get the military and police to consider and take their oath seriously, it causes strategic uncertainty in the minds of the elites. So they will hesitate and buy us more time take the public back from the ground up. It can be done. We can do it. That's why they want to censor our for us free speech because they know that in the end if we have free speech we will win. They know that. 

Alex Jones: [00:04:11] That's why the Southern Poverty Law Center and others wrote these federal reports that we got leaked by good police last year who are demonizing us because they understand. they're they're brainwashing military and police, and we're here telling them the truth. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:04:25] Exactly. They're there. They're building that wall bigger and bigger between the people and the police and the military and we're trying to tear that wall down. And they want to label you as a hate monger and me as a hate monger because that's their tool to be able to censor you. if they can if you can have you designated as a hate organization then they can get the ISP providers to to stop access to you. I even had reports that at some military bases I haven't confirmed yet. But in some cases having a hard time getting onto Oath Keepers dot org. So not sure what's going on. 

Alex Jones: [00:04:54] No no I've seen confirm reports of that actually. I've been sent screenshots of you not being able to go to the site. That it's one thing to be blocked on bases and colleges. That's bad enough. And then lying about us. But now government is telling ISPs period for their customers and it's going to grow to everything. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:05:14] And so so I mean it's be this is the this is the fight. we have to fight on First Amendment First. we have to be as adamant and as militant about defending our first amendment rights as it would the Second Amendment. but we also should prepare for the very worst. I think you should be on ham radio and we should all be on ham radio. 

Alex Jones: [00:05:30] I'm on a hundred thousand watt been on it for 14 years right. WWCR, we're live right now. Six hours a day or more. We're actually eight hours a day now on WWCR. But again the main fights on the web site I can post any video on YouTube and get 100000 views easy that's dead. I mean my films have had more than 150 million views conservatively. That's hurting them Stewart. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:05:52] Oh certainly. But but we should prepare for the worst. 

Alex Jones: [00:05:54] I'm saying no no I agree with you in fact I've already had a secret plan for a year while we have the new office that we're building next door to to go to a file we send people who then print up a local newspaper. We're not going to be stopped. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:06:08] And just in case go back to the old the old hand-bills on the street corner if you have to go. 

Alex Jones: [00:06:13] We're going 1776. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:06:14] Exactly. That's the answer right. 

Alex Jones: [00:06:16] We already knew this. I mean we already knew this but it. Do you agree with me that the fact that the UN openly is calling for web censorship, Microsoft, the White House, Google that that they're doing it now is because they're going into a new more dangerous phase. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:06:31] Well sure. That the mask is slipping and they're getting ready. That's why the cyber terrorism act talks about a state of emergency. So say you have an economic collapse, Where say it's done intentionally. Now you can you can shut down the Internet, shut down all communications. And once again you'll get only what's on. You probably have like America radio or something where it's all you're gonna hear. 

Alex Jones: [00:06:51] Actually the White House said that we may shut down the Web to save it. And they said oh during the flu we may make all sites direct to the UN who. I mean that they're saying it right. Right. And then Cass Sunstein tells the truth to the White House and says no these people are exposing us, we've got to shut them down and arrest them. Did you read those papers he wrote. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:07:11] No I did not. 

Alex Jones: [00:07:12] I mean people ought to read it. I mean these people are out there obviously the tyrants. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:07:16] Absolutely. So what do we do. I think we need to organize locally. I think we need to make sure we have strong communities, get to know your neighbors, get to know all your police in your area and all the veterans. and start developing those networks down at the very bottom half of our society and get ready for whatever comes. 

Alex Jones: [00:07:35] Clearly you've been invited to them, but the Tea Party has been co-opted by the RNC. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:07:39] Well it is a struggle inside the Tea Party right now that. there's two sides to it. The grassroots parties they are still there. Gillespie County Patriots is an example of that. We just had Sheriff Mack and I speak last night. But there is this new entity what's called the Tea Party Nation. And so that's that's obviously. 

Alex Jones: [00:07:55] It's Fox Nation. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:07:56] Right. It's an attempt to co-opt the Tea Party movement. 

Alex Jones: [00:08:00] And they're like more wars police state Patriot Act good. Yeah. I mean you notice Bush and Obama continue the same policies. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:08:06] Right. Sarah Palin's speech I watched it last night. It was all standard Neo-Con old GOP insider hack language. 

Alex Jones: [00:08:14] I'm going to be covering it this week. We're in big trouble. Let's talk about the solution. The police and military are not bad people. They're brainwashed like general public. If we can reach out to them through the Oath Keepers and other groups we can short circuit this entire behemoth. Stewart Rhodes is our guest, we'll give you the Web site. How you get informed how you read the pledge, the ten orders they will not follow. There's a lot of troops in Iraq and Afghanistan, wearing the patches. It's got the system scared. We'll be right

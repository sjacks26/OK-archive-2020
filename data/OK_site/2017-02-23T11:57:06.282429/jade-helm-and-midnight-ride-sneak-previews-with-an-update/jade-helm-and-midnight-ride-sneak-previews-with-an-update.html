<h2 style="text-align: center;">Some Sneak Previews With An Update!</h2>
<p>With deep gratitude for all who have given your dollars to fund the making of the powerful documentary film, MIDNIGHT RIDE, James Jaeger has been busily piecing together segments for 2015’s definitive movie about Martial Law. He would like to share a few clips from the movie. Up first is the opening credit span for the film —</p>

<p>James has just sent me his latest good news. I’ll paste in some excerpts for you:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Dear MIDNIGHT RIDE Associate,</em><br/>
<em> </em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>You haven’t heard from me in about 30 days because we are done with the interviews and extremely busy with post production. </em><br/>
<em> </em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px; text-align: left;"><em>In all we will have 14 head-liner interviews in MIDNIGHT RIDE…  </em><br/>
<em>We are now cutting the best of these interviews into the narration to derive the first “rough cut” of the show.</em><br/>
<em>But here’s the first part of the BIG news: we are thrilled to announce that Hollywood producer, RICHARD B. IOTT, has come aboard the production as senior producer.  Mr. Iott’s company, BRAEBURN ENTERTAINMENT, LTD. and MATRIX ENTERTAINMENT worked together with OATH KEEPERS to bring you MOLON LABE, and now this powerful team is bringing you MIDNIGHT RIDE. </em><br/>
<em> </em><br/>
<em>The second part of the BIG news is BRIAN G. ROCKEY has ALSO come aboard the production as Producer.  We are so honored and thrilled to have Mr. Rockey on board in this capacity for he has been one of our most loyal and generous producing partners on not only this production, but the past 5 productions.  Brian has not only believed in these Consitutional films, but believed in them early</em><em>…</em></p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Rogue Politicians? Martial Law? Here in America?</h2>
<p>You betcha!</p>
<p>The alarming announcement by our own military that they need to do Psychological Operations in Civic Affairs using Psy-Op soldiers in civilian disguise right here on U.S. soil should chill our bones to the marrow. Being announced as an <a href="../index.html?p=5999" target="_blank"><em><strong>Unconventional Warfare</strong></em></a> exercise, JADE HELM 2015 appears as a massive Psy-Op and is obviously a conditioning ploy at best, with abiding sinister possibilities at worst.</p>
<p>Jade Helm 15 strikes many people as a portentous government plan, a pre-fabricated and pre-constructed umbrella under which a black op by the Deep State’s compartmentalized agencies could possibly “Go Live” in a fantastic sort of Shock and Awe False Flag psycho-coup to jar the public mind of America through fear into acceptance of some nefarious policy the government desires, such as the setting aside of our Constitution under Martial Law. From the movie, Stewart Rhodes shares some facts for our consideration —</p>
<div class="video-container">

</div>
<p>This film will feature Ron Paul himself along with G. Edward Griffin, our Founder Stewart Rhodes, Sheriff Mack, and Oath Keepers’ national Chaplain Chuck Baldwin, among others such as GOA’s Larry Pratt and Tea Party co-founder Walter Reddy.  Also featured in the movie will be Dr. Edwin Vieira, Jr., whose book, “<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Tyranny-Out-Necessity-Bastardy-Martial/dp/0967175976/ref=sr_1_9?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1434332408&amp;sr=1-9&amp;keywords=edwin+vieira" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.amazon.com/Tyranny-Out-Necessity-Bastardy-Martial/dp/0967175976/ref=sr_1_9?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1434332408&amp;sr=1-9&amp;keywords=edwin+vieira', 'By Tyranny Out Of Necessity: The Bastardy of Martial Law');" target="_blank"><strong>By Tyranny Out Of Necessity: The Bastardy of Martial Law</strong></a>“, inspired James Jaeger to produce the film. It is a powerful movie with a powerful message concerning America’s impending fate under the current threat of our government’s incessant wish to establish “martial law” in our country.</p>
<p>But the movie is more than that — it is also a showcase for Oath Keepers’ “Ten Orders We Shall Not Obey”. James Jaeger worked with Edwin Vieira to incorporate our Ten Orders into the script for the movie. So Oath Keepers will have a prominent presence in the film from the opening screen credits throughout the dialogue by the featured experts, and right down to the concluding message of hope for an America which is now under direct siege by ominous powers operating in Washington D.C., powers who need to have a practice exercise like JADE HELM 2015 before they can feel confident enough to drop the iron net of martial law on our unwitting nation. Here, from his footage in MIDNIGHT RIDE, is Ron Paul —</p>

</div>
<p>I think Dr. Paul is looking quite spiffy in this movie, don’t you? And I love his way with words. But to me, equally impressive are some great moments in the film by Edwin Vieira himself. Here is a classic sample.</p>
<div class="video-container">

</div>
<p>Thanks to the writings of Edwin Vieira, this movie will describe the four types of “Martial Law” in a powerful way. Oath Keepers is America’s premiere Liberty Movement Counter-PSYOP organization. Constitutional truth is our mainstay. Our members are in all ranks across America and they’re daily talking with patriotic Veterans, firefighters, police, and soldiers about that Oath and about unlawful orders. I like to envision thousands of American patriots helping spread the message carried in MIDNIGHT RIDE.  I feel a sense of excitement in getting this movie completed and ready to distribute while JADE HELM is still operational.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">A CALL FOR YOUR HELP!</h2>
<p>Do you want to help Oath Keepers get this movie made ASAP? Here’s how. First, share the link for this article with your family and friends so they can do likewise. Help us spread the word about the movie. That is good activism and doesn’t cost money to do.</p>
<p>Secondly, support the production with donations.

Our membership has helped, since this past November, about seventy thousand dollars, and we only need less than twenty thousand now to finish the movie. All donations should be sent directly to Matrix Entertainment</p>

<p>I would like to share with you some brief passages from a little-known treasure Dr. Vieira published in 2013, titled <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Three-Rights/dp/0967175968/ref=pd_sim_14_3?ie=UTF8&amp;refRID=17NPY4ERSF09CBGX0QDW" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.amazon.com/Three-Rights/dp/0967175968/ref=pd_sim_14_3?ie=UTF8&amp;refRID=17NPY4ERSF09CBGX0QDW', '“Three Rights”');" target="_blank"><em><strong>“Three Rights”</strong></em></a>.</p>
<p>Quoting:</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>THREE RIGHTS</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>by Dr. Edwin Vieira, Jr.</strong>–</h3>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The assertion “We The People of the United States ***do ordain and establish this Constitution” enounces a right, a privilege, and a power to constitute a “government”. It emphasizes that this “government” did not “ordain and establish” itself, and that public officials did not “ordain and establish” either their own offices or the authority of those offices, because no “government” or public official is infused with a right, privilege, or power to “ordain and establish” anything independent of The People. “Government” and officialdom are political creatures, not creators. They arise ex nihilo from The People’s will, and are always subject to it. As long as public officials claim to exercise “governmental” powers under the aegis of the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution, they must also acknowledge that We The People are the original authors of, the real parties in interest with respect to, and the absolute and final arbiters of both of those documents – and that therefore all officials owe duties of loyalty and obedience to The People, embodied in and fully enforceable through the Constitution’s unqualified command that every official “shall be bound by Oath or Affirmation, to support this Constitution”. By necessary implication, “to support this Constitution” includes a duty to support the Declaration of Independence, too, because the legal authority of the Constitution depends upon the ongoing legal efficacy of the Declaration.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The statement “whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of the [ ] ends [for which Governments are instituted among Men], it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it” invokes, not only an explicit right, but also an implicit privilege and power utterly to transform the body of law which provides for that “Form of Government”. This being “the Right of the People” alone, neither the “destructive” “Form of Government” nor any of its officials can claim any say in the process, or assert any right, power, or privilege to resist any stage of the transformation. Rather, both are exposed without recourse to whatever changes “the People” may make and whatever means “the People” may employ to make those changes, and labor under a moral, political, and legal duty to acquiesce in the result.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">* The declaration “when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce the [ People ] under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government” affirms, not only an explicit right and duty, but also an implicit power, of “the People”. But not, quite revealingly, a privilege – for a privilege is the opposite of a duty; and because, under the posited circumstances, it is “their duty to throw off such Government”, “the People cannot be free or at liberty not to do so. On the other side, because every “Government” is no more than a mere creature and instrument of “the People”, and it is “the [ People’s] duty, to throw off [an abusive] Government”, then no “such Government” can claim either a right or a power to oppose ”the People’s” fulfillment of that duty. Indeed, because it is “the People’s” “right” under “the Laws of Nature and of Nature’s God” to “throw off such Government”, it is the correlative duty of every “such Government” to allow itself to be “throw[n] off.” Any resistance interposed against “the People” is fundamentally unlawful. Thus “the People’s “ “right” and “duty” imply an absolute immunity from interference by rogue public officials and a correlative absolute disability in those officials.</p>
<p>Skip to page 12 –</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">From the foregoing can be deduced:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">(1) We The People’s original right and power of declaration, ordination, and establishment of the supreme law of the land (the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution).<br/>
(2) We The People’s right of on-going supervision and participation in the operations of the governmental apparatus at every level of the federal system – by voting for various “representatives”; by investigation, exposure, and criticism of public officials through exercise of “the freedom[s] of speech” and “of the press”, and by “petition[ing] the Government for a redress of grievances”; and especially by serving in “the Militia of the several States”.<br/>
(3) We The People’s Right of Resistance against every manifestation of usurpation and tyranny.<br/>
(4) We The People’s Right of Restoration of a government of “just powers” at every level of the federal system.<br/>
First, by the simple recognition that the Constitution does fully incorporate the principle of the Declaration of Independence that “Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers” – and only such powers – “from the consent of the governed”. The Preamble to the Constitution identifies as one of its purposes “to***establish Justice”. The Preamble establishes an overarching rule of construction and application with respect to everything that follows in the Constitution. Therefore, all of the powers delegated to the General Government and reserved to the States must be so construed as to constitute “just powers” only, and must be applied only to that extent – precisely as the Declaration asserts must always be the case for every legitimate “Form of Government” under “the Laws of Nature and of Nature’s God”.<br/>
Second, by reliance on the right of reformation – the right to preserve what is good and eliminate what is bad; to repair, alter, and improve what has proven defective but can nonetheless be salvaged; and to compel wrongdoers in public office to make as complete reparations for their nonfeasance, misfeasance, and malfeasance as possible, in accordance with the requirements that they all “shall be bound by Oath or Affirmation, to support th[e] Constitution”.<br/>
Third, when all else fails, by recourse to the right of “revolution” – yet “revolution” only in a narrow sense: namely, “to abolish” an old and “destructive” “Form of Government” and “to provide new Guards for the [People’s] future security”, by “institute[ing] new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to the [ People] shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness” in conformity with “the Laws of Nature and of Nature’s God”.<br/>
(5) Through the exercise of all of these rights, We The People’s Right of Renewal of their government, and through it of their Nation. For if The PEOPLE enjoy a right to form their own nation in the first place, they certainly possess a right to renew its vitality from time to time as the need arises.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Thus can be identified We The People’s most important Three Rights as against any corrupted “Form of Government” and the rogue public officials who administer it; Resistance to bad government, Restoration of good government, and by those means Renewal for the Nation. Self-evidently, all of these rights also implicate duties, because if they are not exercised in a timely and effective manner, and rogue officials cause the existing “Form of Government” to degenerate to the point at which it cannot be salvaged, THE PEOPLE will be compelled to exercise “their right” and to fulfill “their duty, to throw off such Government” entirely. So, well before THE PEOPLE arrive at the point at which circumstances compel them to exercise that “right” and to fulfill that “duty” – that is, even while the situation involves systematic usurpation and tyranny eating away at the vitals of public administration, but has not yet led to a state of affairs in which that “Form of Government [has] become [ irreparably] destructive [of the true ends of Government]” – THE PEOPLE must not only enjoy a right but also must labor under a duty to exercise and enjoy their other various rights, powers, privileges, duties, and immunities in such a way as will render their assertion of “their [ultimate] right” and their fulfillment of “their [ultimate] duty” unnecessary.</p>
<p><em><strong>-End quoted passages from Dr. Vieira’s “Three Rights” –</strong></em></p>
<p>I am saying that in Dr. Vieira’s writings we see the very rare marriage between common sense and academic excellence ordained by the unbridled conscience of the human race universal. Each movie James Jaeger completes in his Constitution series not only gets the voices of Edwin Vieira, G. Edward Griffin, Ron Paul and others onto the record — each new film James produces also lends new credence to our American heritage of Constitutional freedom, prosperity, and the pursuit of happiness.</p>
<p>One may go to Amazon dot com and buy Dr. Vieira’s books. There are no finer teaching tools than his books and the James Jaeger collection of Constitutional documentary movies. We’ve been right all along, and here’s the proof!</p>

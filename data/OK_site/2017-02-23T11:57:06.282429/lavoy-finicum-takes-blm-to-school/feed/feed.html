<content:encoded>AMEN.  AMEN.  In every way that we each can and everytime we can stand, stand my brothers and sisters in everyday that we each can stand as we journey to restore liberty.
<p>With God all things are possible. God has His hand on us and our actions to restore our God-given Constitution and the liberties that this great documents reflects to America and to the world.</p>
<p>With rightous indination we can and we must challenge unConstitutional actions by our federal government and we must and we will hold each traitor accountable for treason, which has no statute of limitations.</p>
<p>Justice will be served.  We are a nation of laws and while our government may refuse to abide by our Constitution, our supreme laws, we will lawfully restore our Constitution and hold each and every traitor accountable.  So, my brothers and sister, stand together and fear not for God is for us no one can justifiably be against us. Peace to men and women of good will. Peace…</p>

<p>By John W. Whitehead</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“A government which will turn its tanks upon its people, for any reason, is a government with a taste of blood and a thirst for power and must either be smartly rebuked, or blindly obeyed in deadly fear.”—John Salter</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We have entered into a particularly dismal chapter in the American narrative, one that shifts us from a swashbuckling tale of adventure into a bone-chilling horror story.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As I document in my new book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Battlefield-America-War-American-People/dp/1590793099/ref=asap_bc?ie=UTF8" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.amazon.com/Battlefield-America-War-American-People/dp/1590793099/ref=asap_bc?ie=UTF8', 'Battlefield America: The War on the American People');" target="_blank"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Battlefield America: The War on the American People</span></a>, “we the people” have now come full circle, from being held captive by the British police state to being held captive by the American police state. In between, we have charted a course from revolutionaries fighting for our independence and a free people establishing a new nation to pioneers and explorers, braving the wilderness and expanding into new territories.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Where we went wrong, however, was in allowing ourselves to become enthralled with and then held hostage by a military empire in bondage to a corporate state (the very definition of fascism). No longer would America hold the moral high ground as a champion of freedom and human rights. Instead, in the pursuit of profit, our overlords succumbed to greed, took pleasure in inflicting pain, exported torture, and imported the machinery of war, transforming the American landscape into a battlefield, complete with military personnel, tactics and weaponry.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To our dismay, we now find ourselves scrambling for a foothold as our once rock-solid constitutional foundation crumbles beneath us. And no longer can we rely on the president, Congress, the courts, or the police to protect us from wrongdoing.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Indeed, they have come to embody all that is wrong with America.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For instance, how does a man who is relatively healthy when taken into custody by police <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2015/04/19/us/baltimore-freddie-gray-death/" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.cnn.com/2015/04/19/us/baltimore-freddie-gray-death/', 'lapse into a coma and die while under their supervision');" target="_blank"><span style="color: #0000ff;">lapse into a coma and die while under their supervision</span></a>? What kind of twisted logic allows a police officer to <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2015/04/16/us/arizona-police-run-over-suspect/" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.cnn.com/2015/04/16/us/arizona-police-run-over-suspect/', 'use a police car to run down an American citizen');" target="_blank"><span style="color: #0000ff;">use a police car to run down an American citizen</span></a> and justifies it in the name of permissible deadly force? And what country are we living in where the police can beat, shoot, choke, taser and tackle American citizens, all with the protection of the courts?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Certainly, the Constitution’s safeguards against police abuse means nothing when government agents can crash through your door, terrorize your children, <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/texas-calls-dogs-kissing-noises-killing-article-1.1978648" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/texas-calls-dogs-kissing-noises-killing-article-1.1978648', 'shoot your dogs');" target="_blank"><span style="color: #0000ff;">shoot your dogs</span></a>, and jail you on any number of trumped of charges, and you have little say in the matter. For instance, San Diego police, responding to a domestic disturbance call on a Sunday morning, showed up at the wrong address, only to <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/san-diego-kills-pet-dog-knocking-wrong-door-owner-article-1.2154428" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/san-diego-kills-pet-dog-knocking-wrong-door-owner-article-1.2154428', 'shoot the homeowner’s 6-year-old service dog');" target="_blank"><span style="color: #0000ff;">shoot the homeowner’s 6-year-old service dog</span></a> in the head.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Rubbing salt in the wound, it’s often the unlucky victim of excessive police force who ends up being charged with wrongdoing. Although 16-year-old Thai Gurule was charged with resisting arrest and strangling and assaulting police officers, a circuit judge found that it was actually the three officers who unlawfully <a href="http://www.oregonlive.com/portland/index.ssf/2015/03/judge_rules_portland_teen_xxxx.html" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.oregonlive.com/portland/index.ssf/2015/03/judge_rules_portland_teen_xxxx.html', 'stopped, tackled, punched, kneed, tasered and yanked his hair');" target="_blank"><span style="color: #0000ff;">stopped, tackled, punched, kneed, tasered and yanked his hair</span></a> who were at fault. Thankfully, bystander cell phone videos undermined police accounts, which were described as “works of fiction.”</p>

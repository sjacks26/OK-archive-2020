<p><em>This article was written by Zen Gardener and originally published at <a href="http://www.zengardner.com/ignore-obvious/" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.zengardner.com/ignore-obvious/', 'ZenGardener.com');">ZenGardener.com</a></em></p>
<p>I have a hard time with people not being willing to recognize what’s obviously in front of their faces. It’s a voluntary mind game people play with themselves to justify whatever it is they think they want. This is massively exacerbated by an array of social engineering tactics, many of which are to create the very mind sets and desires people so adamantly defend.</p>
<p>But that’s no excuse for a lack of simple conscious recognition and frankly makes absolutely no sense.</p>
<p>We can’t blame these manipulators for everything. Ultimately we all have free choice. Plainly seeing what’s right in front of our noses, no matter how well sold or disguised, is our human responsibility. That people would relinquish this innate right and capability totally escapes me.</p>
<p><strong>The Handwriting On the Wall</strong></p>
<p>Actually, it’s much more obvious than even that. Pointless wars costing millions of innocent lives, poisoned food, air and water, demolished resources, manipulated economies run by elitist bankers who nonchalantly lend money with conditions for “interest”, corporate profiteering at any cost to humanity, a medical system built on sickness instead of health, media mindmush poisoning children and adults alike, draconian clampdowns for any reason, and on and on.</p>
<p>Why is this not obvious to people that something is seriously wrong, and clearly intended to be just the way it is? Do they really think it’s gonna iron itself out, especially with clearly psychopathic power mad corrupt maniacs in charge?</p>
<p>That’s what they’ll tell you. “Give it time, we’re just going through a hiccup. Everything works out…” yada yada. Why? Because that’s what they want to believe. And the constructed world system is waiting with open arms to reinforce that insanity. And “Heck, if millions of others feel the same as me I can’t possibly be wrong.”</p>
<p><strong>Fear of Drawing Conclusions</strong></p>
<p>That’s pretty much the bottom line. Acceptance for seeming security. However, if even one of these inroads of control vectors becomes clear to people then their whole world threatens to turn upside down. When two or more start appearing then the discomfort becomes quite intense, and that’s when the decision takes place. Either they keep pursuing this line of awakened thought or they shut it down.</p>
<p>It’s all about comfort. And what a deceptive thing that is! Call it sleepwalking to oblivion or what have you, it’s endemic to today’s dumbed-down society. This is why the education system was their primary target since way back, conditioning humanity from childhood to not think analytically but to simply repeat whatever is in their carefully sculpted curriculum.</p>
<p>But most of all do not question authority.</p>
<p>We see this in the news cycle daily and how people react, or should I say don’t react. They’re taught that until the so-called authorities determine what really happened, whodunnit and all the rest, they’re not allowed to make any sort of judgement. No matter how obvious, whether it’s the “suicide” of a prominent whistleblower by several impossible gunshots to the head or clearly engineered false flag events, they won’t form a decision until they get the “signal” it’s OK to think that way.</p>
<p><strong>The Cost of Cowardice</strong></p>
<p>It’s not just infuriating but literally costing those very people, their children and the rest of us, our lives. We can only hold ourselves accountable for such cowardice. Each of us. Unless we stand up against it. And that is an individual choice, not a group one.</p>
<p>We each answer for ourselves. And once we do answer the call to wake up we take action. That’s the only rational response. We’ll tell others like there’s no tomorrow, because there may not be one if we don’t. We take appropriate action in our own lives first and move to prepare our loved ones for what may be immediate consequences of what we’ve realized is going on and how to avoid or mitigate it. We change our eating and buying habits, we re-evaluate our livelihood, personal attachments and living conditions.</p>
<p>All the while intelligently yet passionately sharing what we’ve discovered to be true and the possible consequences.</p>
<p>That’s called waking up. And it’s not comfortable. It’s a lot of hard work, and takes a lot of courage. But really we’re only acting in a responsible manner when we do so, simply doing what’s right. It’s not that big of a deal – unless our priority is how we appear to others, and keeping old patterns of behavior and possessions that we call “comforts”.</p>
<p>How misleading can anything be?</p>
<p>They say a rut is just a grave with the ends kicked out. I heartily agree.</p>
<p><strong>Waking Up Is A Choice</strong></p>
<p>No one can take away our right to choose. We can comply with circumstances or we can make our own path. We can be true to the truth at any time we choose, or we can go along with the deceit and cover up all around us and just get by, thinking that’s the way of self preservation.</p>
<p>Cover your ass, as they say. It’s insane to the core.</p>
<p>The irony is that that is the biggest lie of all. What happens to one happens to all. When innocents are being slaughtered, whether next door or in some far away land, those are <strong>our</strong> sons and daughters, brothers and sisters. If we allow this inhumanity to man to flourish it will soon consume all of humanity at the hands of those who think they have the most to gain.</p>
<p>We live in such a world. We have to face it for what it is and respond. That’s the only conscious choice. Not in anger or fear, but in full awareness and an overwhelming love for truth and our fellow man.</p>
<p>It’s the only choice.</p>
<p>Choose – and act – wisely. Don’t shirk it. We all suffer as a result.</p>
<p>Know that to the bone…because it’s the Truth.</p>

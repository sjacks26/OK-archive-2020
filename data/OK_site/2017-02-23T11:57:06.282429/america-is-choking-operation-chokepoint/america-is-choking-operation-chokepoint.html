<p style="text-align: justify;">Operation Chokepoint is another means of driving small businesses out of business. Why? Because the PTB want you totally dependent on big business for your every need. It is the “New-Feudalism”. – Shorty Dawkins, Associate Editor</p>

<p>by Mike Maloney</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Last fall, I got a strange request from the bank I’ve been doing business with for more than 10 years. For the first time ever, this bank asked to see our books. When we asked why, they told us that they needed to review our risk profile.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It seemed odd to me, because we do everything by the book and are about as low-risk as a grocery store or a dry cleaning service. Not to mention the fact that, through all of the various fees we have to pay, our company generates tens of thousands of dollars in revenue for our bank each month.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With nothing to hide, we complied with the request. And naturally, we passed our unexpected risk assessment with flying colors. The bank thanked us for our cooperation, but never really explained the situation to my satisfaction.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A month later we were going through our semi-annual anti-money laundering (AML) training. This is another way we make sure our business is squeaky-clean at all times. Our employees are all trained to spot and report anything that has the appearance of illegality.</p>

</div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I casually mentioned to our AML trainer that our bank had put us through this bizarre risk assessment a couple of months earlier.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“Oh, that’s because of Operation Choke Point” he said, as if it was common knowledge.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“Operation What Point?!” I replied.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He went on to tell me the full story, and it was so frightening that it literally caused the hair on my neck to stand on end.  Though he didn’t use these exact words, the point of what he was telling me was that the US government is waging a new war.  It’s an undeclared war.  It’s an underground war.  It’s a covert war.  But now, slowly but surely, more Americans are becoming aware of this war because they are finding out that they are the targets in this war.  They have become the enemy of the state.  That’s because this war is a war on small business in America.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If this power grab by the executive branch of our government is allowed to continue, Americans soon won’t be able to buy gold, guns, or a variety of other goods and services, because the businesses that sell them won’t exist. Operation Choke Point is a war on liberty that’s using ideological intimidation to put certain small businesses out of business.</p>

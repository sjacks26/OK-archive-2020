<p>By Corinne Rose – 21Alive</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">FORT WAYNE, Ind. (21Alive) — As Oath Keepers continue their daily protection detail at Fort Wayne’s Armed Forces Career Center, more and more people are stopping by to thank them.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Here’s the update to the story that’s captured the attention and hearts of so many of our viewers.</p>
<p><script src="https://player.bimvid.com/v2/vps/wise/cc7cb700a7c16aa110735d4c4f050afffc43db2b/ref=aHR0cDovL3d3dy4yMWFsaXZlLmNvbS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsL1Blb3BsZS1zaG93LXRoZWlyLWdyYXRpdHVkZS10by1PYXRoLUtlZXBlcnMtc3RhbmRpbmctZ3VhcmQtYXQtcmVjcnVpdGluZy1jZW50ZXItMzE4MjA3NTYxLmh0bWw"></script></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Like others across the country, this group of veterans and first responders is guarding military recruiting centers, since the servicemen inside are not allowed to carry weapons, even after the deadly attacks at a center last week in Chattanooga, Tennessee.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The men tell 21Alive news they’re humbled by the thank you’s, drinks and food that people continue to offer.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“People stop, shake our hands, say thank you. A couple people have broke down into tears. They drop water, donuts, food, the businesses, I mean, it’s just really good. Everyone seems to be real supportive,” says Bryan Humes from Oath Keepers.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Some of the businesses are letting the Oath Keepers use their facilities, property managers say the men can be wherever they’d like, and shoppers tell them they feel safer since they’re here.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Bandido’s Taqueria even gave them dinner the other night.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“First of all, they’re veterans. I noticed… I come in early, 7am in the morning, and some of them were out there from seven to six at night protecting fellow armed forces servicemen and things like that. Just the fact they’re veterans and they’ve done a lot for us, it was a simple decision, I think,” says manager Dan Knepper.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“It’s not about us, it’s about them, you know, making sure they’re protected. They’re not allowed to be armed. If they were, that Tennessee thing would have never happened. So we want to make sure it doesn’t happen here,” Humes says.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A mom of twin girls enlisting in the Navy got choked up about their act of generosity.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“These people are phenomenal. For somebody to stand up and protect the servicemen who do so much for us and who protect us and our freedoms, I think that it’s… I’m just beside myself. I think it’s beautiful,” Staci Glaze says.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Something else people appreciate — many of these men are self-employed.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">But they say they’re happily giving up days of work to protect the servicemen inside.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“For me to be out here for a few days, it’s a little sacrifice, but I’m willing to do so,” says Hugh Franks of Oath Keepers.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Oath Keepers say they’ll remain outside this recruiting facility until the military members inside are allowed to be armed or until others step forward to relieve them of their protection detail.</p>

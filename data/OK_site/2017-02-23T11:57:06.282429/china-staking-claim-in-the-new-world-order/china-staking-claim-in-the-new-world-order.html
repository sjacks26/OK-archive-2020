<p style="text-align: justify;">For those in the Liberty Movement who can’t help but think that somehow Russia and China, along with the BRICS, are slated to be the saviors of the world, somehow, the truth is, that Russia, China and the BRICS all support the New World Order. It is the old con game of controlling both sides of an argument that is not being noticed by those same Liberty Movement individuals. Brandon Smith of Alt-Market.com, (and Associate Editor of this website), has pointed out, on numerous occasions, the absurdity of thinking that world leaders who openly speak of the New World Order, are here to save us. – Shorty Dawkins, Associate Editor</p>

<p>by Alex Newman</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Learning to speak Chinese may be a really good investment — at least if the globalists get their way.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In 2009, billionaire establishment power broker George Soros, a close ally and financier of Obama, called for the communist regime ruling mainland China to “own” what he referred to as the “New World Order.” Speaking to the Financial Times about what Obama should discuss while in Beijing, the self-styled philanthropist declared that the United States and the U.S. dollar were on their way down, and that the Communist Party regime must step up to the plate.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“I think you really need to bring China into the creation of a new world order, financial world order,” Soros told the Financial Times. “I think you need a new world order, that China has to be part of the proc­ess of creating it and they have to buy in, they have to own it in the same way as the United States owns … the current order.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It was hardly a slip up. The next year, while receiving the Globalist of the Year award from the Canadian International Council, Soros again called for China’s participation in the emerging global-governance regime. “They have now got to accept responsibility for world order and the interests of other people as well,” declared Soros. “Today, China has not only a more vigorous economy, but actually a better functioning government than the United States.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Soros, of course, is hardly the only senior globalist who has been openly celebrating the rise of Communist China’s rulers as key players in the emerging “New World Order.” From Beijing to Moscow and Washington, D.C., to London, globalists are all openly pushing for this new order, which is essentially just a euphemism for world government.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In a joint statement put out by Obama and then-Chinese dictator Hu Jintao, Obama made clear that he was fully on board with the agenda. “The United States reiterated that it welcomes a strong, prosperous, and successful China that plays a greater role in world affairs,” the declaration reads.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The internationalists’ intent to make China an integral part of the New World Order — to even “own” it, according to Soros — should tell us a great deal about the type of New World Order Soros and his ilk envision. After all, not only does the People’s Republic of China hold the distinction of murdering more people than any other regime in history, but China today still brutalizes and oppresses its citizens, from forcing women to undergo abortions in compliance with its one-child policy to persecuting believers for practicing their faith (see the related article “<a href="http://www.thenewamerican.com/world-news/asia/item/21026-chinese-tyranny-2-0" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.thenewamerican.com/world-news/asia/item/21026-chinese-tyranny-2-0', 'Chinese Tyranny 2.0');" target="_blank"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Chinese Tyranny 2.0</span></a>“). If such a regime is “actually a better functioning government than the United States,” as Soros claims, how would Soros have the new world function? How about his fellow globalists?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Anyone who doubts that a communist regime as despotic as China’s could realistically become a leading player in the New World Order need only to survey the record to learn otherwise. This record, summarized below, includes China’s ascendency in the existing “global governance” institutions — the United Nations, the International Monetary Fund, and more. It also includes the new global governance architecture that China is building that will complement the already-existing structure, according to the architects themselves. Finally, the record shows that China is by no means single-handedly increasing its dominance — that Western globalists’ fingerprints are all over China’s rise.</p>

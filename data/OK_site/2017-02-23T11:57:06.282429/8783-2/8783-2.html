<p><strong>ASSOCIATE EDITOR’S NOTE:  The only point where I would disagree with Bob is that the evidence shows the globalists are seeking to destroy the Petrodollar, not save it, hence the dramatic fall in oil prices facilitating the threat of a Saudi depeg.  Otherwise, a very well done article.  – <em>Brandon Smith</em></strong></p>
<p>Every so often an event occurs that lays bare the fraud of government better than anything that can be written or said. We saw such an event last week.</p>
<p>In my writing of late, I’ve focused on the Machiavellian strategies employed by the government and its main players to steal from you your wealth and liberties and to turn this once-Constitutional republic into a Third World collectivist nanny-state hellhole, all under the sweet-sounding sake of safety and name of democracy. You can read some of them <a href="http://personalliberty.com/immigration-has-become-the-seminal-issue-of-our-time/" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://personalliberty.com/immigration-has-become-the-seminal-issue-of-our-time/', 'here');" target="_blank">here</a>, <a href="http://personalliberty.com/the-american-terrorist-white-christian-owns-guns-and-believes-in-liberty/" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://personalliberty.com/the-american-terrorist-white-christian-owns-guns-and-believes-in-liberty/', 'here');" target="_blank">here</a>, <a href="http://personalliberty.com/the-nwo-and-its-open-border-gambit/" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://personalliberty.com/the-nwo-and-its-open-border-gambit/', 'here');" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="http://personalliberty.com/the-nwo-and-its-open-border-gambit/" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://personalliberty.com/the-nwo-and-its-open-border-gambit/', 'here');" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>The massacre of 14 people (plus 21 wounded) in San Bernardino, California, by American Muslim Syed Rizwan Farook and his Pakistani wife, Tashfeen Malik, peeled back the veneer of massive government fraud and deception. The so-called war on terror, the surveillance state, the security state and oppressive gun laws are nothing more than feckless distractions designed to give the illusion of safety while your liberties are stolen from you one by one.</p>
<p>The American government and its shadow, deep state operatives, along with allied governments and their intelligence agencies, used Muslim sectarianism to create al-Qaida and ISIS, supplying them with weapons and training in proxy wars and for the purpose of overthrowing sovereign governments. This is part of the globalists plans to blow up the Middle East, preserve the petro-dollar and ensure the dominance of our “allies” in the region: Saudi Arabia, Turkey and Israel. This is part of the long-range neocon plan as outlined in the <a href="http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/pdf/RebuildingAmericasDefenses.pdf" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'download', 'http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/pdf/RebuildingAmericasDefenses.pdf');" target="_blank">Project for the New American Century (PNAC)</a>.</p>
<p>It began in the 1950s with the CIA operation, funded by Kermit Roosevelt with CIA money, to overthrow the elected government in Iran via a “spontaneous” popular revolt, continued with the first Gulf War attack on Iraq, and evolved into the now 14-year-old war in Afghanistan, and the subsequent destruction of Iraq, Libya and now Syria.</p>
<p>After 9/11, orchestrated (if you believe the government’s conspiracy theory) by CIA operative Osama bin Laden, the government embarked on a “war on terror” to “keep us safe.” The idea, George Bush the lesser assured us, was to kill “them” over there so we wouldn’t have to kill “them” over here.</p>
<p>So for 14 years straight, and nigh on <a href="http://personalliberty.com/operation-desert-storm-beginning-perpetual-war/" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://personalliberty.com/operation-desert-storm-beginning-perpetual-war/', '25 years');" target="_blank">25 years</a> if you take it back to Bush I’s unconstitutional first Gulf War, which never really ended, we have been killing “them” over there. But that didn’t keep “them” from setting off a bomb in the World Trade Center in 1993. It didn’t keep “them” from flying airliners into the World Trade Center and the Pentagon in 2001. And it didn’t keep “them” from creating a bomb factory and acquiring weapons and hording ammo for a big attack in San Bernardino last week.</p>
<p>Nor did the surveillance state, which monitors everyone’s communications and bank and credit card transactions to such an extent that the NSA felt the need to create a $1.5 billion 1 million square-foot data center in Utah to store everything it’s ever collected on everyone.</p>
<p>Farook was an American citizen who, despite trips to countries with histories of radicalizing young men and frequent communications with what the security state describes as people on the FBI’s radar because of their connections to terrorism, remained under their radar while he and his wife acquired paramilitary training and, along with a group of a half dozen or so other “Middle Eastern” men built bombs in the middle of a residential neighborhood. The Department of Homeland Security’s “See something, say something” program failed because saying something, as DHS requests in pamphlets and public service announcements, often gets one tagged as racist or Islamophobic or xenophobic. (See <a href="http://www.breitbart.com/texas/2015/10/23/clock-boy-ahmed-may-leave-texas-school-district-silenced-telling-side-story/" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.breitbart.com/texas/2015/10/23/clock-boy-ahmed-may-leave-texas-school-district-silenced-telling-side-story/', 'the response');" target="_blank">the response</a> to Ahmed Mohamed, the clock boy.)</p>
<p>Malik was a vetted foreigner — vetted by the security state — and allowed into the country despite her ties to Muslim countries known to support terrorism. As <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/san-bernardino-shooting/tashfeen-malik-mother-san-bernardino-massacre-pledged-allegiance-isis-leader-n474246" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/san-bernardino-shooting/tashfeen-malik-mother-san-bernardino-massacre-pledged-allegiance-isis-leader-n474246', 'NBC explains it');" target="_blank">NBC explains it</a>: “Malik entered the U.S. on a K-1 visa, which is required of a fiancé [in this case, a fiancée] engaged to a U.S. citizen. These visas are granted after the applicant undergoes a rigorous security screening process aimed as (<em>sic</em>) preventing so-called ‘Green Card’ marriages.”</p>
<p>In addition to collecting all our communications and financial transaction data, the security state <a href="http://personalliberty.com/the-4th-amendment-may-it-rest-in-peace/" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://personalliberty.com/the-4th-amendment-may-it-rest-in-peace/', 'watches us');" target="_blank">watches us</a> with drones and security cameras on every corner, as well as with vehicles containing backscatter cameras that see through our walls and into our vehicles. It gropes and/or forces us into radiation spraying scanners before we can travel, questions us at random checkpoints, and paws through our bags and forces us to empty our pockets before entering public venues.</p>
<p>California has some of the strictest gun laws in the nation. Yet Farook and Malik used legally acquired weapons with appropriate background checks. No word has yet been uttered from the MSM or the FBI whether the bomb-making material they possessed was legally acquired, however.</p>
<p>So as we now see, none of this “keeps us safe”: not the so-called war on terror, the surveillance state, the security state or the oppressive (for law-abiding citizens) gun laws. For who feels “safer” from the threat of terrorism in America today than he did 25 years ago? Certainly not the American public, despite assurances from the mainstream media and the government men and women who claim that’s the purpose of the war on terror, the surveillance state, the security state and oppressive gun laws.</p>
<p>So what do we hear from the MSM and the government men and women? After hours of hoping the shooters were conservative white men and, failing that, trying to hide the ties to radical Islam and attempting to deflect from the terrorism angle, we hear from the establishment and the government men that what we need is more war on terror, more surveillance state, more security state and more oppressive gun laws.</p>
<p>Oh, and we also heard — before the MSM was even comfortable with releasing Farook’s name — from the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), who dutifully explained once again how Islam is a religion of peace. CAIR, it must be noted, has a history of funding terrorism and is a front group for the Muslim Brotherhood, a terror organization bent on destroying the west. The MSM, somehow, let that little tidbit slip past as CAIR “condemned” the terror attack and Farook’s relative explained how no one saw it coming.</p>

<content:encoded>You can easily build a Tesla device at home that generates free electricity, I found the instructions &amp; video proof at <a href="http://reviewcrewtv.com/how-to-create-a-tesla-free-energy-device-that-generated-free-electricity/" rel="nofollow">http://reviewcrewtv.com/how-to-create-a-tesla-free-energy-device-that-generated-free-electricity/</a>

<content:encoded>Jessie my brother your thoughts are my thoughts about this issue. Cept for the cop thing. (I haven’t ruled that out though) I’ve been trying to prep for about a year and a half. Have accumulated some of the necessities but I’m aware that I have to ramp up due to the government ramping up with their obvious non action.<br/>
 I don’t understand why so many people refuse to see what’s so obvious to me. Open southern boarder, letting Ebola come into the country, our foreign policy towards Isis. They are causing all of the problems and positioning themselves to act when the people finally wake up. They are prepping in a sense to me,  to act against us more than they are prepared for the southern invasion or allowing a viral invasion.<br/>
 As far as I can tell Jessie it’s not when the SHTF. It’s already hitting! The fan is on low speed right now but the finger is on the switch waiting to push to level two. I’m prepared some but not enough. I’m the type who’s never fully prepared. Even if I was? I’m never happy. You can always be more prepared in my mind.<br/>
 You know that you can talk sometimes till you’re blue in the face to people about this and they just don’t get it. Just yesterday my brother in law was at my house and I was talking to him about my thoughts and when it got to explaining about what this administration is doing he said to me “I don’t get involved with govern stuff! Now this is a guy who is an avid hunter, he has the protection, he has the knowledge of survival due to his years of hunting, he had a 6 month supply of meat till his house was raided by the local police with the game warden. Why? cause someone said he was trapping on their property. He didn’t go to jail but he’s paying dearly for it. I scolded him when it happened. I said this is what I’m talking about. The only thing that made him think was when I explained to him about a possible EMP attack. He didn’t know what it was. I explained to him what would happen. And what desperate people would do if they knew he had food.<br/>
 When I told him there would be no food on the shelves, no fuel, no water, and the reasons why. That’s when he got it! He said you mean I’d have to live off the land? I can do that. Yea but it’s not enough I said. I told him I’m buying a walkie talkie set and that I’m giving him two, one for him and one for my sister so we can stay in contact.<br/>
 You know brother it’s frustrating. Money? I’m not that worried about it. It’s going to be useless anyway. I have some for an emergency but my priority right now is food water and ammo. The bio gear? If it gets that bad we’re probably doomed anyway. They’ll have to shoot me before they come to take me and my family to a fema camp. Good luck to you and yours pal. I’ll pray for those who are foolish not to at least try to be ready. I won’t feel sorry for them though.

<content:encoded>PS-as far as prepping?<br/>
Country/Rural  people have always stocked up.<br/>
So they don’t have to go into “town.”<br/>
Because “town” is nothing but TROUBLE.<br/>
Cops, thugs, thieves, liars, politicians…… guess politicians is redundant….I already listed thugs, thieves, liars?<br/>
Anyway….we country people AVOID town.  Because the afore mentioned ALWAYS try to steal and make problems.
<p>Last Month:<br/>
“You went 2mph over posted speed limit.” The cop said.<br/>
cost $75. I was going with traffic flow. Likely a little slower. My truck is old.<br/>
That is WHY Cop pulled me over. Truck is old and is work truck with dirt.<br/>
$75 for what?  Made up Nonsense.</p>
<p>Another occasion:<br/>
Tool box was stolen from back of pickup.  But cop didn’t have time for report.<br/>
Said, “I was careless for leaving things in pick up bed.” Cop Scolded me for someone STEALING from me.<br/>
Tool box was locked. But not bolted in. They took whole cross bed tool box. </p>
<p>I know nothing about “preppers”.  But a man is a fool to depend on ANYONE for Anything.  Unless if they are blood family or you have known them for 25 years, played sports with, or served in your squad.</p>
<p>I would advise all men of thought, to get your house in order. Get out of town. Get out of USA.<br/>
Sell out and LEAVE. Remove money from bank YESTERDAY.<br/>
But what do ignorant country people know?  City folk are so darned smart and pretty with shiny things.</p>

<content:encoded>There is NOTHING ACCIDENTAL about this Ebola.<br/>
YOUR supposedly elected Amerika president<br/>
KNEW the consequences.<br/>
CDC KNEW consequences. CDC had a stand down in Dallas.<br/>
Feds and president  ALLOWED Flights from Ebola infected areas into  Amerika.<br/>
Feds and president REFUSED to secure our borders and to enforce immigration Law.<br/>
Feds transported KNOW infected immigrants across Amerika to spread disease.<br/>
Feds have pre built camps.<br/>
Feds have had coffins pre manufactured years ago.<br/>
Feds have the DOT rules already in place that allows drivers to go past standard DOT<br/>
rules for rest when transporting bodies.  That was in place over 5 years ago that I know of.
<p>What we have is Bio-Warfare by Amerikan CDC Fed officials and the president AGAINST the AMERICAN people.<br/>
That is what happened.  Stop being a child and believing these things were not planned YEARS ago.</p>

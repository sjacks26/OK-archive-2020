Please take the time to listen to this interview with Sam Andrews of the MO, Oath Keepers who was spearheading the Oath Keepers operations in Ferguson both a year ago and now. Please share this out with everyone you know.” [Click to go to YouTube]</p></div>“The Southern Poverty Law Center describes the Oath Keepers as a ‘fiercely anti-government, militaristic group,’ Cassandra Vinograd <strong><a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/michael-brown-shooting/oath-keepers-turn-michael-brown-protests-ferguson-missouri-n407696" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/michael-brown-shooting/oath-keepers-turn-michael-brown-protests-ferguson-missouri-n407696', '“reported” for NBC News');" target="_blank">“reported” for NBC News</a></strong> about members of the group assuming protective duties for businesses in Ferguson. It’s a meme the establishment media is desperate to plant in the collective consciousness, along with implications of racism being a prime motivator.
<p>“If there were black and brown people in this country who showed up in the streets open carrying assault rifles in paramilitary garb would they still be received the same way?” Patricia Bynes, Democratic Committeewoman of Ferguson Township, asked. “It seems to be that especially when it comes to the Second Amendment there seems to be a different way that it is enforced.”</p>
<p>The media has been so busy trying to promulgate that lie, they apparently didn’t have time to do the most basic of searches to find Oath Keepers’ unequivocal position decrying violent racism in Ferguson, and reminding residents of their absolute right keep themselves safe. Because the group is calling on them to do just that.</p>
<p>“You have the power to police your own neighborhoods, and keep them safe for all,” Jeff Ford of Oath Keepers declared in <strong><a href="../oath-keepers-open-letter-to-the-people-of-ferguson-missouri/index.html" target="_blank">an open letter</a></strong> the media has chosen to remain oblivious to – or to keep buried. “Black veterans have a proud and noble example to follow, in the Deacons for Defense and Justice, who were World War II and Korean War veterans who stood up to the violence of the Klan, except this time, you must defend against violence by anyone, whether outsiders or locals, of any race, against anyone, of any race.</p>
<p>“If you take care of your own neighborhoods, it removes the sense of emergency that is used to justify a heavy police presence,” Ford elaborated. And that can also have a lasting effect even after the protests are over. Be your own ‘police.’”</p>
<p>No wonder those jealous of power, such as St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar, described people providing for their own protection, and volunteers, as “both unnecessary and inflammatory.” He’s the same oath-breaking “official” who tried to illegally order them to stand down, until <strong><a href="https://www.scribd.com/doc/249001595/Letter-for-Oath-Keepers-to-Chief" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'https://www.scribd.com/doc/249001595/Letter-for-Oath-Keepers-to-Chief', 'a letter from Oath Keepers’ attorney');" target="_blank">a letter from Oath Keepers’ attorney</a></strong> made him stand down instead.</p>
<p>Still, as Oath Keepers, you know all this and I know all this – but what does the general public “know” that hasn’t been planted by media Fourth Estate Fifth Columnists?</p>
<p>“Heavily armed ‘Oath Keepers’ inject disquieting element in Ferguson,” Scott Malone of <strong><a href="https://ca.news.yahoo.com/heavily-armed-oath-keepers-inject-unease-riot-hit-085709866.html" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'https://ca.news.yahoo.com/heavily-armed-oath-keepers-inject-unease-riot-hit-085709866.html', 'Reuters injected into the narrative');" target="_blank">Reuters injected into the narrative</a></strong>. “Four white men carrying military-style rifles and sidearms added a disquieting element to riot-torn Ferguson, Missouri…</p>
<p>Malone goes on to give the obligatory nod to SPLC smear tactics, and then quotes Talal Ahmad, a guy whose <strong><a href="http://www.burquemedia.com/index.php/2015/07/19/reflections-on-ferguson-boots-on-the-ground-by-talal-ahmad/" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.burquemedia.com/index.php/2015/07/19/reflections-on-ferguson-boots-on-the-ground-by-talal-ahmad/', 'whole shtick');" target="_blank">whole shtick</a></strong> seems to depend on blaming “white privilege” for all social ills.</p>
<p>“You’re going to bring some uncommissioned citizens, white citizens, into a black community like this? It’s disrespectful,” Ahmad opined. “Here, in a black neighborhood, we’re already living in a state of terror.”</p>
<p>That Oath Keepers has pointed to the way to maintain respect and not to live in terror, and then led by example, seems not to have registered. It does not seem to occur to him that protesting against the police and then demanding they be the only ones with guns are contradictory. Some people would evidently rather hold on to their prejudices than consider what they preach contributes to the problem.</p>
<p>That’s something the establishment media shares. The same insinuations about race, the same references to SPLC, the same repetition of the “inflammatory” comment by the political cop who can’t (won’t) do anything about real flames, were all showcased by various “news” outlets that dominate where most Americans learn about current events.</p>
<p>“Oath Keepers arrival at Ferguson protest ‘inflammatory,’ top cop says,” <strong><a href="http://www.foxnews.com/us/2015/08/11/oath-keepers-arrival-at-ferguson-protest-inflammatory-top-cop-says/" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.foxnews.com/us/2015/08/11/oath-keepers-arrival-at-ferguson-protest-inflammatory-top-cop-says/', 'Fox News insisted');" target="_blank">Fox News insisted</a></strong>. “Presence of militia-style group in Ferguson questioned,” <strong><a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/presence-of-militia-style-group-oath-keepers-in-ferguson-questioned/" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.cbsnews.com/news/presence-of-militia-style-group-oath-keepers-in-ferguson-questioned/', 'CBS News added');" target="_blank">CBS News added</a></strong>. “Two Images Show the Double Standard for Black and White Protesters in Ferguson,” <strong><a href="http://mic.com/articles/123697/two-images-show-the-double-standard-for-black-and-white-protesters-in-ferguson" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://mic.com/articles/123697/two-images-show-the-double-standard-for-black-and-white-protesters-in-ferguson', 'News.Mic wailed');" target="_blank">News.Mic wailed</a></strong>. “Armed white men from Oath Keepers arrive in Ferguson, stoking tension,” <strong><a href="http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2015/8/11/armed-white-oath-keepers-arrive-in-ferguson.html" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2015/8/11/armed-white-oath-keepers-arrive-in-ferguson.html', 'AlJazeera shrieked');" target="_blank">AlJazeera shrieked</a></strong>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, those who would bring about the destruction and death the presence of Oath Keepers can discourage are producing nowhere near the media hysteria as do what the elites really hate: Americans exercising the Second Amendment-recognized right to keep and bear arms in order to provide for the common defense, ensure domestic tranquility and secure the blessings of liberty.</p>
<p>“<strong><a href="https://twitter.com/phampel/status/630586362412961793" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'https://twitter.com/phampel/status/630586362412961793', 'We[’re] ready for war!');" target="_blank">We[’re] ready for war!</a></strong>” a mob prepping for mayhem chants.</p>
<p>And the media reserves its condemnation for Oath Keepers there to preserve the peace.</p>
<p>Again, you know all of this and I know all of this, but most people will never learn of it because the “mainstream media” so dominates the narrative.  But we can do more than complain about it—we can go through, over, under or around the gatekeepers by being force multipliers for the Oath Keepers message, which all of us should be doing as a matter of course, and simply put, as a matter of duty.</p>
<p>Take a moment, right now, as soon as you’re done reading this, and share the link to <strong><a href="../oath-keepers-open-letter-to-the-people-of-ferguson-missouri/index.html" target="_blank">the open letter</a></strong> we talked about and to <strong><a href="https://youtu.be/7sf8ajvPFdQ" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'https://youtu.be/7sf8ajvPFdQ', 'this powerful video');" target="_blank">this powerful video</a></strong> of Sam Andrews from Missouri Oath Keepers explaining the Ferguson situation in a way the media will not. Send links to those within your sphere of influence you think will be receptive to them, and ask them to share as well. Also include in your communiqué a link to Shorty Dawkins’ latest offerings, “<strong><a href="https://oathkeepers.org/oath-keepers-in-ferguson-the-truth-behind-the-lies/" target="_blank">Oath Keepers in Ferguson: The Truth Behind the Lies</a></strong>,” and “<a href="https://oathkeepers.org/msm-tries-to-demonize-oath-keepers-as-usual/" target="_blank"><strong>MSM Tries To Demonize Oath Keepers (As Usual</strong>)</a>,” and “<strong><a href="https://oathkeepers.org/a-snowball-named-reuters/" target="_blank">A Snowball Named Reuters</a></strong>” by Elias Alias. And don’t forget to include the link to this article as well.</p>
<p>While you’re at it, it wouldn’t hurt to copy local or national media, just to make sure they have no excuses left for their shoddy agenda reporting. And it would also be very helpful to leave comments under slanted accounts to help correct the record for people who might not otherwise even be aware they’re being manipulated by the press.</p>
<p>Effective command and control are impossible without reliable communications and intelligence. If each Oath Keeper – if you — took just five minutes each day sharing the latest information, the articles, the email alerts, the notices, from national and from your state leadership, it would provide an  informational  force powerful enough to bypass and counter establishment media ignorance and lies.</p>

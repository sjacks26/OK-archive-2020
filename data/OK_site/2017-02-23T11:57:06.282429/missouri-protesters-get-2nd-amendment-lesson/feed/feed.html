<content:encoded>It would be nice to see the oath keepers protecting people from the militaristic psychotic police rather than protecting property.  I think their numbers and image would swell if they took that approach.

<content:encoded>If Missouri is an Open Carry State, why aren’t the “Blacks” allowed this same standard. Why are unarmed Blacks being killed at will here instead of being able to protect themselves?
<p><strong>–<br/>
[Editor’s note: Dee, the Blacks are citizens just like anyone else, so of course they have the lawful right to open carry in Missouri, so long as they do not carry in a threatening manner. I think the reason most Blacks do not consider open carry is because they have been taught not to, or have been intimidated from doing so. Maybe you should ask the local government in Ferguson about that, yes? Oath Keepers is teaching Blacks in Ferguson, and indeed all over America, that carrying our arms is a Constitutionally-protected right that shall not be infringed. If the authorities at Ferguson have a problem with that, then the face of tyranny is truly bared and exposed. No law-abiding American should be denied the right to self-defense, self-protection, and to the right to keep and bear arms. If this country were to go back to universal bearing of arms, so that everyone was armed, crime would be next to Nil and the police would have a much easier job.<br/>
Help Oath Keepers spread the word, yes? Thank you for reading here.<br/>
Salute!<br/>

<content:encoded>It’s hard to take an organization like the Southern Poverty Law Center seriously when it was founded and run by a fiercely anti-American pedophile…

<content:encoded>It would seem to me that this Missouri law shoots itself in the foot by saying the Right to keep and bear arms is held un-a-lien-able and the Right to keep and bear arms will not be held in question. Then it goes on to say “restrictions”….. If the state of Missouri really upholds the 2A, why is there a CCW permit system in the state? Is it a Right or something else? How about permits to think, pray or speak? More later.

<p>by Brandon Smith at Alt-Maket.com</p>
<p>With the Crimea referendum passed and Russia ready to annex the  region, the United States and the European Union have threatened  sanctions. The full extent of these sanctions is not yet known, and  announcements are pending for the end of March.  If these measures are  concrete, they will of course be followed inevitably by economic  warfare, including a reduction of natural gas exports to the EU and the  eventually full dump of the U.S. dollar by Russia and China. As I have  discussed in recent articles, <a href="http://www.alt-market.com/articles/2041-deluded-currency-cultists-believe-the-dollar-is-invincible" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.alt-market.com/articles/2041-deluded-currency-cultists-believe-the-dollar-is-invincible', 'the result');" target="_blank">the result</a> of these actions <a href="http://personalliberty.com/2014/03/04/ukraine-crisis-just-another-globalist-engineered-powder-keg/" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://personalliberty.com/2014/03/04/ukraine-crisis-just-another-globalist-engineered-powder-keg/', 'will be disastrous');">will be disastrous</a>.</p>
<p>For those of us in the liberty movement, it is now impossible to  ignore the potential threat to our economy. No longer can people claim  that “perhaps” there will be a crisis someday, that perhaps “five or 10  years” down the road we will have to face the music. No, the threat is  here now, and it is very real.</p>
<p>The loss of the dollar’s world reserve status will destroy the only  thread holding up its value, namely, investor faith. There are only two  possible outcomes from that point onward:</p>
<p><strong>A)</strong> The U.S. will be forced to default because no  nation will purchase our Treasury bonds and support our debt spending,  causing the dollar’s value to implode.</p>
<p><strong>B)</strong> The Fed will choose to restart and expand  quantitative easing measures, confiscate pension funds, raid bank  accounts or issue new taxes in order to keep the system afloat; this  will also end in the eventual collapse of dollar value and  hyperinflation.</p>
<p>The consequences will lead to an explosion in prices — first in  commodities and necessities like petroleum, imported raw materials,  food, electricity, etc. and then in all other goods and services.  Austerity measures will be instituted by Federal and State governments.  Cuts to social welfare programs, including food stamps, are probable.  Civil infrastructure will suffer. The cost effectiveness of maintaining  public utilities could become unrealistic.  Anyone relying on such  services may find themselves cut off for days, weeks or indefinitely.  Public suffering will invariably rise, along with public crime.</p>
<p>If events like Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans are any indication,  the Federal government’s response will be inadequate, to say the least.  The Federal Emergency Management Agency clearly cannot be relied upon to  provide food, shelter, medical care or protection for communities. In  fact, in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, the Feds did far more harm  than good, corralling people into camps where death was rampant and  disarming outlying neighborhoods so that they could not defend  themselves. Tens of millions of dollars in donated and Federally  purchased necessities were never delivered to aid survivors. Trucks were  turned away, and help from civilian sources was denied.</p>
<p>The point is, if you find yourself in the midst of a national or  international catastrophe, you should assume that you will be on your  own with whatever preparations you made beforehand. To assume otherwise  would be foolish, given our government’s track record.</p>
<p>There are some people who will argue that during an international  crisis, such as an economic war or a world war, there is no purpose to  preparedness. They will argue that there is nothing an individual or  family can do to weather the storm or fight back, because the scale of  the threat would be “too great.” There is no place for such defeatism in  the life of the liberty-minded. The scale of the threat is irrelevant,  and only cowards give up a fight before it even begins.  Survival and  freedom require an unwavering conviction.  Nihilists will fulfill their  own prophecies, suffering a fate exactly as they imagine for the rest of  us; living in fear, slavery, and obscurity.</p>
<p>That said, it is also important to acknowledge the truth that the  majority of Americans today are utterly unready for a minor localized  disaster, let alone a national or global crisis. This problem, though,  could be easily remedied with a few simple beginning steps. I find that  most people are not averse to the idea of preparedness, but many have  trouble taking the first steps in the right direction. For longtime  preparedness champions, the information listed here might seem like  old-hat.  However, I challenge each liberty movement member to approach  at least one friend or family member who could benefit from the steps  below.  Prepping appears daunting to the uninitiated; show them how  simple it can actually be.</p>
<p>Below is a list of goals that every liberty movement member and  American can easily achieve starting today and continuing over the  course of the next month. If enough citizens were to take the initiative  to do these things, all threats — no matter how imposing — could be  overcome.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><strong>Buy Three Months Of Food Stock</strong></p>
<p>Food supply is the greatest Achilles’ heel of the American populace.  Most homes store less than one week’s worth of food items at any given  time. The average person needs between 2,000 and 3,000 calories per day  to maintain sufficient energy for survival. It takes around four to six  weeks for a person to die of starvation and malnutrition. In a collapse  scenario, most deaths will likely occur within the first few months,  either by weakness and illness, or by looting and violence. The idea is  to at least get through this first catastrophic phase without becoming a  villain, or falling victim to one.  One person removed from starvation  is one possible threat removed from the equation.</p>
<p>Three months of supply is not ideal by any means, but it will buy you  precious time.  Start with 2,000 calories per day per person. Bulk  foods can be purchased cheaply (for now) and can at the very least  provide sustenance during emergencies. A 20-pound bag of rice, for  instance, can be had for less than $15 and provides about 30,000  calories, or 2,000 calories per day for 15 days for one person.  Supplement with beans, canned vegetables and meats, honey for sugar, or  freeze-dried goods, and you will be living more comfortably than 90  percent of the population.</p>
<p>Food stockpiling is one of the easiest and most vital measures a  person could take. Yet, sadly, it is one of the last preparations on  people’s minds.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><strong>Buy A Water Filter</strong></p>
<p>Do not count on city water to remain functional. Even during a  drawn-out economic downturn rather than an immediate crisis, there is a  good chance that some utilities will be sporadic and unreliable. This  means you will have to focus on rainwater collection, as well as water  from unclean sources. Boiling the water will kill any bacteria, but it  will not kill the taste of sediments and other materials floating  around. A high-grade survival filter is the best way to get clean water  that tastes good.</p>
<p>The average person needs about a gallon of water per day to remain  healthy and hydrated. I highly recommend the Sawyer Mini Water Filter,  which is a compact washable filter that can cleanse up to 100,000  gallons of water. It uses no moving parts, making it harder to break;  and it costs only $20.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><strong>Buy A Small Solar Kit</strong></p>
<p>Try going a week or two without electricity, and you may find how  dismal life can truly be. The very absence of light at night reduces  one’s productivity time drastically, and using fuel for lanterns is not  practical in the long term. Solar power is truly the way to go for a  grid-collapse scenario.</p>
<p>I’ve heard much whining about the cost of solar power, but small  systems that will serve most electrical needs can be set up for less  than $1,000. Two 100-watt panels, a power inverter, charge controller  and four to six 12-volt deep-cycle batteries are enough to deal with  most electrical needs in a survival situation; and all these items can  be contained in a portable foot locker for minimal cost. New solar  panels are much more effective in low-light conditions and winter  weather as well, making solar a must-have prep item.</p>
<p><strong>Store A Fuel Source</strong></p>
<p>Twenty gallons of gasoline treated with fuel saver is not expensive  to purchase today, but in the midst of hyperinflation, it may be  impossible to obtain tomorrow.  Kerosene is useful for heating and  cooking.  Propane can be stored for decades and runs numerous  appliances.  If you live in a forested area, dried wood can be had for  free, and can keep you warm throughout the winter months (keep in mind  the your local danger factor when using fire).  It is vital to have a  means to stay warm and fed during the most difficult seasonal changes,  especially during a grid down scenario.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><strong>Find Alternative Shelter</strong></p>
<p>There are no guarantees during a full-spectrum disaster. Having all  your eggs in one basket is not only stupid, but unnecessary. Always have  a plan B. That means scouting an alternative location for you and your  family in the event that your current shelter comes under threat. This  location should be far enough away from large population centers but  still within a practical range for you to reach them. It should also  have a nearby water source, and be defensible. Establishing supply  caches near this site is imperative. Do not assume that you will be able  to take all of your survival supplies with you from your home. Expect  that surprises of a <span style="font-style: normal;">frightening</span> variety will arise.</p>
<p><strong>Buy One Semi-Automatic Rifle</strong></p>
<p>At this point I really don’t care what model of rifle people  purchase, as long as they have one, preferably in high capacity and  semi-automatic. AR-15, AK-47, Saiga, SKS, M1A: just get one! Every  American should be armed with a military-grade rifle. If you are not,  you are not only negligent in your duty as a free citizen, but you are  also at a distinct disadvantage against the kind of opponents you are  likely to face in a collapse situation.</p>
<p><strong>Buy 1,000 Rounds Of Ammunition</strong></p>
<p>Again, this is by no means an ideal stockpile, but it is enough to  get you through a couple rough patches if you train furiously. Cheap  AK-47 ammo can be had for $5 for a box of 20 rounds. Get what you can  while you can, because the prices are only going to skyrocket in the  near term.</p>
<p><strong>Approach One Friend Or Neighbor</strong></p>
<p>Community is what will make the difference between life and death  during a SHTF collapse. I challenge everyone in the liberty movement to  find at least ONE other person to work with in the event of disaster.  Lone-wolf operations may be strategically practical for short periods of  time; but everyone needs rest, and everyone needs someone else to watch  his back. Do not fall into the delusion that you will be able to handle  everything on your own.</p>
<p><strong>Learn One Barter Skill</strong></p>
<p>Learn how to fix one vital thing or provide one vital service. Try  emergency medical training, gunsmithing or metal working, as long as it  is an ability that people will value. You have to be able to produce  something that people want in order to sustain yourself beyond the point  at which your survival stockpile runs out. Be sure that you are seen as  indispensable to those around you.</p>
<p><strong>Grow A Garden</strong></p>
<p>Spring is upon us, and now is the perfect opportunity to grow your  own food supply. If you have even a small yard, use that space to grow  produce. Focus on high-protein and high-vitamin foods. Buy a dehydrator  or canning supplies and save everything. Use heirloom seeds so that you  can collect new seed from each crop to replant in the future. If every  American had a garden in his backyard, I wouldn’t be half as worried  about our survival as I am today.</p>
<p><strong>Prepare Your Mind For Calamity</strong></p>
<p>The most valuable resource you will ever have is your own mind. The  information held within it and the speed at which you adapt will  determine your survival, whether you have massive preparations or  minimal preparations. Most people are not trained psychologically to  handle severe stress, and this is why they die. Panic equals extinction.  Calm readiness equals greater success.</p>
<p>The state of our financial system is one of perpetual tension. The  structure is so weak that any catalyst or trigger event could send it  tumbling into the abyss. Make no mistake; time is running out. We may  witness a terrifying breakdown tomorrow, in a year, or if we are lucky, a  little longer.  The path, though, has been set and there is no turning  back.  All of the items above can be undertaken with minimal cash flow.   If you receive a regular paycheck, you can establish a survival supply  for yourself and your family.  There are no excuses.</p>
<p>Take the steps above seriously. Set your goals for the next four  weeks and see how many of them you can accomplish. Do what you can  today, or curse yourself tomorrow. What’s it going to be?</p>

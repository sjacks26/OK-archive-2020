## Alex Jones; Stewart Rhodes

Alex Jones: [00:00:00] The target you need to realize that. And the good news is they wouldn't be trying to shut us down, Stewart Rhodes founder of Oath Keepers, if we weren't effective. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:00:09] Absolutely they understand that they have a window of opportunity that's shrinking and we have a window it's expanding. The longer the Internet is free and the longer we have free speech communication amongst ourselves, the more the veil is lifted and they know that. 

Alex Jones: [00:00:23] Stewart you've, other points in the last 10 minutes we've got, other other programs that Oath Keepers is launching. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:00:29] Well we want to support the police, military, and firefighters directly when they when they keep their oath. and so we've started a new program called family safe. We're launching today if folks go to our Web site Oath Keepers dot org. There's a banner across the very top that links to family safe. That's going to be is Oath Keeper members will volunteer to host the families of any current serving police officer, military, or fire personnel during a time of emergency. So they don't have to worry about their family being safe, like retired cop will host a family of current serving. 

Alex Jones: [00:00:59] And they don't want the community getting involved with the police. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:01:02] Well sure. And what better way to show we have their back and who their friends are than to support them directly by making sure their family is safe. 

Alex Jones: [00:01:09] And look at DU look at Agent Orange. The government doesn't care about the troops and police. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:01:13] Absolutely not, ask any guys who have been injured in the military. They'll tell you usually they try to duck and cover and take you out no benefits. It's happening all the time right now. So you bet. 

Alex Jones: [00:01:23] Stewart where do you see America going. I mean we're defeating them on the swine flu hoax, on the government takeover of health care that's really a new tax. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:01:30] Climate change hoax. 

Alex Jones: [00:01:31] Climate change hoax. So they're in trouble on every front. They in their own white papers. I have Cass Sunstein, White House science czar, White House technology czar, White House information czars, all calling for an end to free speech and talk radio. We have the new head of the FCC saying they may restrict free speech. I mean they're really sending up trial balloons. We've got to get the word out now that we're not going to put up with this. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:01:55] Right. Big the big danger is it is a potential crisis like an economic collapse for example that could be the catalyst to cause people to accept draconian government extreme measures, you know so-called martial Law which is nowhere in the Constitution whatsoever. But that's the that's the biggest danger is that a short term could be a crisis whether it's real or manufactured or amplified that could cause people to say Oh we must turn to the government for help. Like like an economic collapse for example. 

Alex Jones: [00:02:21] And by the way there were three articles last week by top neo cons and a Democrat saying we need a new war or we need a staged event. The people are waking up to us. They even write news articles admitting that. Governor Ridge admitted last year that they would issue fake terror alerts for political game folks. You are the target of the police state we have the MIAC and Homeland Security reports. Stewart in closing What is the New World Order. What are they openly announced. Well why did you wake up. Why are you resisting them. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:02:52] Well I think the the the bedrock of it is a is a belief that you have no natural rights and that the elite are going to be like a new oligarchy that will rule over you as though they were your slave master. And you know most of these people are internationalist elites. They don't believe in sovereignty of any nation. They want to destroy US sovereignty. So that's that's the rock we have to defend is our common, our common bond is our Declaration of Independence, the idea of the consent of the governed and our natural rights. 

Alex Jones: [00:03:20] That's the hedge of protection. Without that we're not America anymore. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:03:23] Absolutely right. Without that, exactly right. We no longer exist as Americans. 

Alex Jones: [00:03:27] Well everybody knows something is wrong. And the elite has gamble with this takeover. I mean they openly announce this is world government we're going to pay our taxes to private banks. this is private banks making themselves kings. It's illegitimate. It's fraudulent. Will we say no. Everybody infowars.com, prison planet dotcom are now censored across the board all over the globe it's being announced. Other sites it's your site tomorrow. This is so you don't have a capacity to really reach people. it's all the big sites now. It's the smaller and medium size sides tomorrow. This is a huge issue and you won't be able to visit oathkeepers dot org soon. If you don't get the word out. we have to let them know that we're not going to put up with censorship. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:04:10] Absolutely. We said earlier use it or lose. Now says this is it. 

Alex Jones: [00:04:14] Well we have to show that when they do these probes and they're probing right now to see if we'll accept this, that we get the word out even more and we boycott the ISPs that are censoring and we sue them and we expose them and we get the word out. or they're going to expand it. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:04:29] And you should also make sure the politicians know that if they vote for it you're going to kick him out of office. When you got you've got to attack a few hides on the on the door to big. 

Alex Jones: [00:04:37] That's right. They pass the greenhouse gas tax in the house not the Senate. They passed a lot of stuff in the house. They passed the cybersecurity bill. The Senate version. We've got the head of the committee Senator Jay Rockefeller West Virginia saying we'd be better off without the Internet. People better grow up and realize tyranny happens everywhere and it's happening here right. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:04:57] And grow a pair and do something about it. 

Alex Jones: [00:05:01] Stewart when you talk to military and police, I mean I get their calls I get the documents they send me. I see the polls. They're really waking up though right now. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:05:09] They are. And we have some that are that are joining the Oath Keepers. We always tell them Look we don't expect you to join in if you don't want to. You don't have to but quite a few more like hey you know what, if I get in trouble for joining this organization. That's an indicator where we are. I don't mind being the canary in the coal mine. But that's an individual choice for each one of them. 

Alex Jones: [00:05:27] Well that's like when I had the idea to have states and cities in over 800 cities four states pass laws against the Patriot Act saying we'll follow the bill of Rights, Constitution. And I mean if that's dirty and bad then what's happened to our country. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:05:41] Exactly right if you get in trouble for keeping your oath and simply reaffirming that you will follow the supreme law of the land then then that that rips the mask all the way off. That has not happened yet but if it does well you know what. Throw me in that briar patch or don't throw me in that patch. You know. 

Alex Jones: [00:05:57] Well Stewart Why do you think for the last 20 years they denied world government they just, they denied it was a banking cartel. And then the last six months they came and said OK it's world government run by banks and we're going to do. I mean why, do you think they were losing traction lying about it. So now they put a good face on it. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:06:13] Well I think they might they might actually think that most Americans will accept it now. I mean if your dollar crashes you might accept a namero. If things are bad enough for you you might go with it. And they've also been indoctrinating our children you know, Not mine, mine are home schooled, but indoctrinated most people during through public school, the model U.N. programs etc. They think the U.N. is wonderful you know. 

Alex Jones: [00:06:35] Well Stewart we're going to go to a break. My my show's going to end. Some stations don't carry it quite a few do. Jason Bermas does three hours every Sunday. You're going with him for the first hour. Appreciate you staying up for that. And we're going to be. You can flesh out more your concerns about what's happening in the world with Jason and I also want to tell listeners Jason is going to continue with phone calls at 8 8 8 2 0 1 2 2 4 4 for Ken, Caillaud, Randy, Drew, and others, specifically who have witnessed Info Wars dot.com or prison planet dotcom being censored by your ISP or by governments. and calls from China. Calls from New Zealand. calls from Italy. They've all announced this and tomorrow we're going to have all the facts, all the screenshots, all the extra proof. it's all right here in the news. We're going to expand on it. The key story right now is up at prison planet. Dot.com Internet censorship major truth providing web sites blocked by Asia Netcom and many other major ISP to New Zealand users. Same thing Italy, same thing Australia, England, Canada, and many areas of the US. So the fact that they're shutting us down in a coordinated operation worldwide right now really concerns me about staged terror attacks and other events because the globalists are stalling on every front. The only card they've got left to play their ace in the hole is stage crises. do you agree Stewart? 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:07:57] Well I think so. I mean throughout history people have always during crisis been willing to give up their liberty and so why would not a government or elites who want to pull the plug on our public, use crisis. 

Alex Jones: [00:08:07] Well we need to send the message right now. Everyone even if we don't even agree with everything we talk about on the show. Get the articles and info wars dot com and prisonplanet.com, facebook, myspace, twitter, local talk stations. Email this article about Infowars censored in New Zealand. More detailed how it's happening worldwide will be out tomorrow morning at Prison planet dot com by 8 a.m. Central Standard Time. Folks we've got to do this together now. we've got to stand up against censorship, and the media will spin it and say well have a Web site wants to restrict comments or something that's ok. This isn't a web site you own or a newspaper Somebody owns restricting what they say, that's fine. You know I'm all for free speech because I own a printing press is the saying. This is governments, the UN, the US government, Cass Sunstein, and major governments openly saying it. Bill Gates coming out last week saying we need net censorship. Google's saying they're working with the NSA. I mean this is really happening. the time for denial is over. We've still got YouTube before they ban all our stuff and they banned us before, fall of the Republic, Free, over five and a half million views just on one channel alone there's hundreds that have it. I mean this film's been seen over 40 million times that we know of free. you know sell a few thousand DVDs, funds the operation. but I'm not even here saying buy the DVDs at infowars.com and support us. You want to that's great. Endgame, free online everywhere. just google endgame blueprint for global enslavement. Use it while you can. Ladies and Gentlemen this is really happening. this is life and death for free speech. They are robbing you. They are raping you. They are destroying our society. They control both parties in every major nation. Great job crew. I'll be back tomorrow live 11:00 a.m. Central. Jason Bermas coming up with another three hour

<content:encoded>I don’t find anywhere in the Constitution that allows for martial law as a result of criminal activity taking place in the United States.  Anyone that think that this is true doesn’t read the founding documents.  And if our government thinks that they can do this, get ready war.

<content:encoded>SgtRock-you are correct. With all the internal strife going on i.e. white officer shooting black civilian they are succeeding at dividing us. This is part of “their” scheme. We need to pull together all classes,races and religions in order to accomplish this. Unfortunately the division of race and religion will prevent this I am afraid.

<content:encoded>” If so then why can,t we just go about our lives as CITIZENS…”
<p>I repeat myself here, but THERE IS NOTHING THAT “overrides” THE US CONSTITUTION except TREASON, If you want to call that an “override”.</p>
<p>“But Seriously if that all there really is to it and I am a simple guy KISS sounds like the best way to get it started. Sooner it is started sooner it is finished.”</p>
<p>Treason, nor the traitors that are committing it are not simple in any way. There are those who are/were “dumbed down” after decades of misinformation that are “just following orders” and “just doing their jobs” without realizing that their job and priority “order” is within that Oath.  It REQUIRES them to be a Constitutionalist – up to even putting their life on the line for it (speaking of military/LE’s here).  But that is actually required of all.</p>
<p>But if one does not know the US Constitution and their state’s Constitution how can they know what is, or is not, lawful in THIS nation?  How do those who serve within our governments actually know the Contract they are under? How do the people themselves know what is allowed and what is forbidden, or even what is forbidden except under specifically laid out circumstances and requirements to be met?</p>
<p>If one does not know our government for themselves, be they citizens or serving within the governments, how do they know right from wrong? How do they know if a superior is lying about the authority they have or if a citizen can tell if the “law or regulation, etc” is a lawful one here in America?</p>
<p>When we have judges who have been trained incorrectly as to their duties, and do not bother to learn what they are required to do to remain in office – do we send someone to train them?  Will they understand that they are learning the laws of our nation, or will ego step in the way and they throw that person out? </p>
<p>None of this is easy.  OK started it out correctly by teaching about the Oaths, the responsibility that goes along with those Oaths.  But it must not stop with the military and LE’s, though they are the ones that will be used against us as force.  It must also be those who serve within the governmental agencies that are unlawfully using the authority of all three branches while they only have the lawful and legal authority of ONE – the one they are under.  As long as those people “just keep doing their jobs” they are a huge part of the destruction of our legitimate government and are traitors to the USA and the American people through their ignorance and on action with no knowledge on their part that they are.</p>
<p>Etc.</p>
<p>None of it is easy. I do not have the answers to all, and as we all must, do what I can where I can effectively (one hopes) make changes.  There are many things we can all do, from using and assisting the tenthamendmentcenter.com, to Oathkeepers, to the CPT’s, to cspoa.org, to the 3%ers, and support people like Gaven Seim (might have spelled it incorrectly – if so, sorry), to places that fight election fraud, whatever works for each of us.  But do something!</p>
<p>God Bless!</p>

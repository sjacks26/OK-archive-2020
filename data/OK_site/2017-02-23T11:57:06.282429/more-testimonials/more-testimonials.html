<p style="text-align: justify;">Testimonial:  Fellow American Citizens and Soldiers. Now, more than ever, I fear we are giving/throwing our rights off the cliff, and unknowingly submitting to the powers that be. We can no longer standby and watch as our civil rights are being violated and our constitution destroyed. The price is too great to do nothing. To be undecided is, or to not care is, exactly what they want. So turn off Jersey Shore, turn off Fox News and look at what is going on around you. Take five minutes to read the Declaration of Independence and you will see the many similarities that our current government has to oppressors at the time. It will wake you up.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I have served two tours in Iraq and one in Afghanistan. I was fighting for the men and women beside me. But I was put there by our elected government. I took an oath to support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies foreign and domestic. As I watch the world situation unfold in a predictable fashion, I can see a change in our way of life in the United States. Our government would have you believe that the NDAA does not apply to US Citizens. Don’t be fooled, any one of us can be taken away in the middle of the night, put into indefinite detention and never given trial. This is against everything in our Constitution. I will not obey unlawful orders or those which violate the Constitution. We must stand up for our rights, for the future of this proud nation and the preservation of Liberty. Be informed, think, don’t just obey. God Bless America!</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Mike in fear of losing his rights</strong>:</p>
<p>Testimonial: There has been tremendous debate and anger over Obama’s and Diane Feinstein’s proposals against lawful gun owners, so in doing research, I went to the current Supreme court rulings on Federally protected rights. Especially the first ten Amendments of our Consitution.  You can obtain a copy directly from the U.S. Justice Dept. yourself by going to:</p>
<p>http://www.justice.gov/usao/ne/press_releases/Civil%20Rights%20Book-NE-2.pdf</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The text below is cut and pasted from page 10 of 31.<br/>
The most recent Supreme Court ruling from this website is dated 2008. But I’m sure Stewart Rhodes can provide anything that might be missing. What is really interesting is that the 2nd Amendment has been incorporated in to the 14th amendment as of 2010. This being the current case by the Supreme Court establishes a protection afforded by the US. Constitution. Whereas I believe, (personal opinion), that President Obama and or Diane Feinstein have absolutely no grounds to usurp the current law of the land. Executive privilege is not withstanding. I will ask Stewart Rhodes or another one of Oath Keepers attorneys to comment on for the rest of the members to understand.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I’m a simple citizen and USMC Vet who happens to be a Patriot. I’m angry that our congress, nor the Supreme Court, have not invalidated Obama’s current use of executive power to override the Supreme Court’s latest rulings. Please read this for yourself and download a copy as well to have on hand for reference.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">[text below cut &amp; pasted from “Know your Rights” Document NE-2.PDF U.S. Justice Dept. Web site.]
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In 2008, the U.S. Supreme Court officially denounced the states’ rights argument. In District of Columbia v. Heller, the Supreme Court formally recognized the Second Amendment as protecting the right of individual<br/>
citizens to possess firearms for lawful purposes without interference by the federal government. Then, in 2010, the Supreme Court “incorporated” the Second Amendment into the due process clause of the Fourteenth<br/>
Amendment in order to protect an individual’s right to bear arms from intrusion at the state level. Still, the right to bear arms is not an unlimited right. Gun laws remain on the books in virtually every state as well as at the federal level. At this time, there is much debate about which laws will be upheld and which ones will be struck down as unconstitutional.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Supreme Court has made it known that certain regulations are acceptable, such as prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill, laws forbidding firearms in schools and government buildings, and rules requiring firearm dealers to apply and qualify for licensing. It is unclear how courts will ultimately treat these and other restrictions. If recent trends are any indication, we will likely see clarification by the Supreme Court on the treatment of firearm regulations. In the meantime, lower courts are taking various approaches. Some courts are looking to see if a particular regulation unduly burdens an individual’s ability to exercise the right. Such a burden exists if the regulation is overly severe or lacks a legitimate, rational justification. Other courts are allowing time, place, and manner restrictions similar to the limitations permitted on the freedom of speech. Certainly one of the chief guarantees of freedom under any  government, no matter how popular and respected, is the right of the citizens to keep and bear arms.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[T]he right of the citizens to bear arms is just one guarantee against arbitrary government and one more safeguard against a tyranny which now appears remote in America, but which historically has proved to be always possible.]

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Anonymous</strong>:</p>
<p>Testimonial: Fellow Patriots,</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I’m an officer in a Military Police company that will assume a Defense CBRN (Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear) Response Force (DCRF) status in the near future. Some aspects of our mission are classified, so please pardon my vagueness. I found this site recently and was reluctant to do anything but monitor it from a distance, but after reading the article about military vehicles being spotted patrolling in-CONUS, with a picture of an ASV (a kind of truck unique to the MP corps), I felt compelled to offer my perspective such as it is. If this puts me on somebody’s watch list, well to hell with it, I’m probably on there already.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The DCRF mission involves rendering humanitarian aid to American citizens following a dirty bomb attack, or similar disaster. It involves federal Soldiers rendering assistance to local police in the event they are overwhelmed by such disaster. Local police are not equipped to deal with large-scale emergencies like that, so we are there to supplement the emergency services you have on hand. Yes, it does involve riot control, and yes it does involve management of displaced civilians.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I believe I speak for just about all of us when I say we’re fully aware that deploying Soldiers inside the U.S. is constitutionally perilous. None of us want to see another Katrina-sized disaster, but even more disturbing is the idea that such a disaster could be used as a pretext for turning parts of our country into a police state with a curfew, and we know that using federal Soldiers to do it would be tantamount to declaring war on our own people. If such a war ever occurred, I know what side just about everyone I know would be on.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As Soldiers, we all know our job is not to patrol American streets. There are, however, a few boundaries that need to be put plain, beyond which none of us shall ever go. Among those boundaries are the following, regarding our presence in your neighborhood:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">1. We are not, and will never be, armed.<br/>
1a. We know you are.<br/>
1b. The only exception to the above would be to guard federal installations, such as government buildings, and that order would have to come directly from the Pentagon.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">2. Contrary to what some believe, the States are still sovereign. We can be lawfully there only at the request of your Governor, and only until your Governor asks us to leave.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">3. We can’t force anyone into an internment camp. If a hasty facility was made to gather displaced civilians, it would be there only until proper lodging could be arranged for them, and the guards at those facilities would be facing out, not in.</p>
<p>4. If we appear in riot gear, it will be because your police are overrun.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">5. If we encounter looters, even of our own gear, we are instructed to let them walk.</p>
<p>6. We are not going into your house or church, ever.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I hope this helps to put the “training exercises” in perspective a little bit. Just know that there are patriots on both sides of this thing, all of us are loyal to the<br/>
Constitution, and none of us can stomach the idea of disarming, interning, enslaving the American people, or what have you. I for one will be instructing my Troops to be extremely cautious, and conscious of the civilians’ God-given rights.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To everybody who sees this, thank you for your service. I’d love to hear your feedback. I’d be particularly interested to hear from any fellow MPs who are or have been on DCRF status.</p>
<p>Stay frosty y’all. Six out.</p>

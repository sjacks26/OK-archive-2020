<p>Here in Eureka, MT, the CPT project has overcome one of the most difficult aspects of organization, namely, finding the right people for various team leadership positions. Our criteria? Experience in the particular field they are coordinating, a good and humble character, and a relentless mindset. If a person doesn’t have all of these attributes, leadership (leadership by example) is simply not possible.</p>
<p>Once team leaders are established, the real work can begin. The mission of CPT is to prepare for numerous possible crisis events and offer the community a point of stability by which average people can find aid in rebuilding, or aid in survival if the crisis is truly terrible. One of the most vital members of your team when it come to planning is your Preparedness (logistics) Team Leader. This person must have solid organizational skills and an knack for attention to detail. They must be a doer, not a complainer.</p>
<p>I recommend making logistics a subject of high priority for your team in the month of May. Economic and social conditions have grown increasingly erratic lately, and supply issues should be dealt with immediately. Here are some suggestions on how to begin…</p>
<p><strong>Gear And Food Check</strong></p>
<p>All team members should participate in a regular monthly gear check. This means they should have all the operational essentials, including their primary rifle, chest rig, mags and ammo, IFAK, bug-out-bag, operation clothing and footwear, communications gear, etc. They should also have lightweight operational food, starting with two weeks supply. Keep in mid that this is not standard food prep, it is food that can be loaded and transported at a moment’s notice. Make sure that if a team member does not pass the gear check, you HELP THEM figure out how they can fill the holes in their logistical supply.</p>
<p><strong>Cache Project</strong></p>
<p>Every team member should assemble at least two caches within the next month. These caches should contain a mix of vital supplies including fire, water filtration, food, shelter, clothing, and defense. I have found that a 5 gallon bucket with a Gamma Seal is one of the cheapest and most effective options for a cache container. Add in some moisture and oxygen absorbers and you are ready to go. Cache foods should be compact, lightweight, dried or freeze dried, and be very high in calorie content. Caches should also be placed in locations far from danger areas but close enough that they can be reached by foot if necessary. Think about what you need to prioritize as far as supply. Keep in mind that food and ammo would likely be at a premium in a crisis situation.</p>
<p><strong>Team Food Supply</strong></p>
<p>Every team member should have their own ample food supply already, but you may want to begin building a team supply as a backup. During the frantic moments of a disaster, there is a high probability that some people will lose a portion of their supplies, or in the worst case, all of their supplies. A backup helps to accommodate for any unforeseen loss of logistics. And, it can also provide aid for family and friends who are driven from their homes without a supply on hand.</p>
<p><strong>Community Food And Water Supply</strong></p>
<p>Remember, CPT goals include providing aid where possible and practical, so that the general community does not implode, or turn to more corrupt organizations for “help”. Often, large supplies of grains and legumes can be obtained from local farmers at a very low price, and water filtration these days is cheap and effective. Teams can voluntarily pitch in a certain amount of cash for this supply. This does not necessarily mean that your job as a team is to feed every poorly prepared person that happens along, but the bottom line is, those who provide food, water, shelter and safety will be the people who determine whether a community remains free, or is enslaved. Do not let the wrong people become the providers for your community, or they may be able to convince the local populace to submit to less than honorable authority.</p>
<p><strong>Overall Medical Supply</strong></p>
<p>Your medical personnel should have a mobile medical supply, and possibly a sturdy tent that can be turned into a sterile aid station. Medical supplies are some of the first items to disappear during a disaster event. Make sure your team is well stocked, not just for yourselves, but also for other people that might require your help in the future.</p>
<p>In our efforts to prepare for the worst the question of “timing” always seems to arise. When will such an event occur? I can only say that the frequency of negative signals has increased greatly, and I recommend that people always assume they have one year or less to get squared away. If we end up with more time, then consider that time a gift, be grateful for it, and continue prepping in the knowledge that you are a year ahead of those people who assume their time is abundant. CPT is not our “life”, but it is a part of our life, and should be treated as valuable as any other endeavor, from work to family.</p>
<p>Self sufficiency and strong community require time and patience, but also considerable effort – logistical effort. Make this effort now and mark my words, one day it will serve you well.</p>

Andrew Napolitano: [00:00:00] The Southern Poverty Law Center compiled a list of political menaces to society. My next guest Sheriff Richard Mack is on that list and so am I. So if you dare. Stay with us on this one. 

Andrew Napolitano: [00:00:15] The Southern Poverty Law Center recently listed 40 individuals it says are leaders of the patriot movement. And it doesn't mean that in a positive way. the end of, the group likens these individuals to dangerous domestic terrorists and rogue militias. And not only does it put me your humble hosts on this list, it also places my next guest on it as well. Joining me now in studio is my good friend. A true American patriot. Sheriff Richard Mack. as many of you know Sheriff Mack is the former sheriff of Graham County Arizona and a longtime crusader for freedom and constitutional rights. Sheriff welcome here. the first time it's a pleasure my friend. 

Richard Mack: [00:00:53] I always wanted to shake your hand. I know have shaken it a lot but since we got on the SPLC list I wanted to shake all 40. 

Andrew Napolitano: [00:01:01] We will some day do that. 

Richard Mack: [00:01:01] I've done about 15 now. 

Andrew Napolitano: [00:01:03] Maybe we'll have the other thirty in here, at least one of them was a colleague of mine in this building. When you and I first met. And we were talking about the role of the police in our society, you told me something which startled me because I had rarely heard it from a high ranking police officer. And that is if your officers under you were ever asked to do something that violated the laws of the state in which you were working, Arizona, the federal laws, the Arizona Constitution, or most importantly the federal Constitution, you would expect them to disobey that order. How would that work. 

Richard Mack: [00:01:36] That's correct. Well my whole case when I sued the Clinton administration was based on that principle. The Brady bill actually forced the sheriffs in this country to comply with a federal gun control scheme. Right. That forced us to violate our oath of office. The oath comes first the Constitution comes first. And that's why I gave every one of our deputies a little pocket sized constitution. 

Andrew Napolitano: [00:02:00] That is a very famous Supreme Court opinion in which you were the plaintiff along with other sheriffs from Arizona and other parts of the country. 

Richard Mack: [00:02:07] Prince and Mack. that it ended up being the Mack Prince case. 

Andrew Napolitano: [00:02:10] And that in that case the Supreme Court basically said to the Congress you can't tell these sheriffs how to do their business. They're in charge of protecting freedom first and safety second. And you can't interfere with that. 

Richard Mack: [00:02:21] To back that point up. Judge Roll at the district court the federal district court level, the first hearing that we had where I testified. The only time I testified. he said that Mack is forced to choose between keeping his oath Or obeying the act. Now that's exactly why I filed the lawsuit. because my own government was forcing me to violate my oath of office. and that's my message to sheriffs and chiefs and police officers, Peace Officer sorry, all across this country that we must comply with our oath of office before we do anything else. 

Andrew Napolitano: [00:02:54] Does the government tell the truth. is the government trustworthy when it tells us things or do we need to look deeper and beyond its words. 

Richard Mack: [00:03:01] The founding fathers told us never to trust government. And we're not supposed to but we're supposed to bind them down with the Constitution. And I guarantee I haven't seen much coming out of Washington D.C. That was true. The only true thing I ever heard in the last 10 years from Washington was when Wilson said You lie. 

Andrew Napolitano: [00:03:17] You're talking about Congressman Wilson from South Carolina to the president of the United States. Do most police officers who put their lives on the line Agree with you Or what would most police officers just do what they're told, even if it meant if it meant a violation of the natural rights, the constitutionally protected rights of whatever whoever they're going after. 

Richard Mack: [00:03:36] I spend all my time now, I've dedicated my life, all my time is to teaching and and hoping to change the minds of cops that we will not be puppets for out of control congress or local legislatures. We cannot allow ourselves to be in that position. I'm all into the Rosa Parks story. OK. She was arrested. I want to ask every peace officer and every sheriff and chief in this country, if you could go back in time would you have arrested Rosa Parks. 

Andrew Napolitano: [00:04:06] Great question great question. I would hope that they would say no. 

Richard Mack: [00:04:09] Absolutely not. 

Andrew Napolitano: [00:04:10] That Their fidelity would be to the constitution correct. no cop in their right mind would arrest a black lady for sitting at a lunch counter because of some local biased law correct. Sheriff Mack it's always a pleasure. Thanks very much for joining us. 

Richard Mack: [00:04:21] Judge thanks so much. 

Andrew Napolitano: [00:04:22] Defending that constitution. I know you have a copy of it in your pocket here too. All right. Thank you

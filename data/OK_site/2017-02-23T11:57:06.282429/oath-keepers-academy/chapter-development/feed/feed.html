<content:encoded>Scott,<br/>
Thank you for your request.<br/>
The listing of State chapters is in the right-hand menu on this page. Click on “Find A Chapter Near You” and when the pop-up window comes up just select “Missouri”. Here is the page for Missouri:

<content:encoded>I served as a Rifleman in the Marine Reserves.  After getting out I met a wonderful woman who joined the Navy several years after we got married.  We have maintained or Utah residency the entire time.  She’s active duty and permanent shore duty, thus we PCS every 2-3 years.  While in Chicago I had my wake up call.  I’m now in Philly.  I’d like to speak to somebody about becoming an Oath Keeper.  How would I join?  What chapter would I join?  How would I remain a member, or transfer membership, every time we PCS?  What about if we get stationed overseas?
<p>Any help would be appreciated.  Also, I’m using a cell phone to view the Oath Keepers website, so the options I’m seeing are very limited.</p>

<content:encoded>I’m a veteran living in Missouri, and after learning of your organization, I am interested in learning more.  Is there a registered chapter in Missouri? If there is how do I apply to become a member? If not , how and what can I do to create a chapter ?

<p>“From 2004 to 2014, over 2,000 terror suspects legally purchased guns in the United States,” Christopher Ingraham of <strong><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/11/16/why-the-nra-opposed-laws-to-prevent-suspected-terrorists-from-buying-guns/" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/11/16/why-the-nra-opposed-laws-to-prevent-suspected-terrorists-from-buying-guns/', 'The Washington Post asserts');" target="_blank">The Washington Post asserts</a></strong>. “Given France’s strict gun laws, the terrorists who attacked Paris on Friday may have turned to black market sources for the weapons they used. But in the United States, known and suspected terrorists are allowed to purchase firearms under federal law.”</p>
<p>It’s hardly a new charge he’s dusting off for a convenient occasion—The New York Times was screaming the same hysterical narrative <strong><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/20/us/politics/20watch.html" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/20/us/politics/20watch.html', 'six years ago');" target="_blank">six years ago</a></strong>.  PBS and AP picked it up <strong><a href="http://www.pbs.org/wnet/need-to-know/the-daily-need/on-terrorist-watch-list-but-allowed-to-buy-guns/8927/" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.pbs.org/wnet/need-to-know/the-daily-need/on-terrorist-watch-list-but-allowed-to-buy-guns/8927/', 'in 2011');" target="_blank">in 2011</a></strong>, then NPR<strong> <a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/itsallpolitics/2013/04/24/178668578/people-on-terror-watch-list-not-blocked-from-buying-guns" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.npr.org/sections/itsallpolitics/2013/04/24/178668578/people-on-terror-watch-list-not-blocked-from-buying-guns', 'in 2013');" target="_blank">in 2013</a></strong>…</p>
<p>What did Rahm Emanuel say about never letting a serious crisis go to waste?</p>
<p>But then again, <strong><a href="http://waronguns.blogspot.com/search?q=WaPo" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://waronguns.blogspot.com/search?q=WaPo', 'WaPo');" target="_blank">WaPo</a></strong> in general and <strong><a href="http://waronguns.blogspot.com/search?q=Christopher+Ingraham" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://waronguns.blogspot.com/search?q=Christopher+Ingraham', 'Ingraham in particular');" target="_blank">Ingraham in particular</a></strong> being monopoly of violence cheerleaders is an old story, too. And to reiterate what ought to be the first thought for any liberty-minded person, a free society does not infringe on unalienable rights without due process.  As we’ve seen in the past, all it takes to get added to a “terror watch list” is taking a <strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150504155324/http:/www.examiner.com/article/should-owning-a-giant-pink-inflatable-pig-make-you-a-prohibited-person" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20150504155324/http:/www.examiner.com/article/should-owning-a-giant-pink-inflatable-pig-make-you-a-prohibited-person', '25-foot giant inflatable pink pig');" target="_blank">25-foot giant inflatable pink pig</a></strong> (really!) to protest rallies, and as for unintentional additions, if it took <strong><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A17073-2004Aug19.html" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A17073-2004Aug19.html', 'Ted Kennedy');" target="_blank">Ted Kennedy</a></strong> and his staff three full weeks to get his name off the “No Fly” list, how long do you think it would take you? Especially with the entire process being kept secret?</p>
<p>And now, like eye-rolling sharks in a feeding frenzy, check out <strong><a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=gun+terror+watch+list&amp;oq=gun+terror+watch+list&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j69i60l2j69i64l2.6330j0j4&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;es_sm=0&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=gun+terror+watch+list&amp;tbm=nws" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'https://www.google.com/search?q=gun+terror+watch+list&amp;oq=gun+terror+watch+list&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j69i60l2j69i64l2.6330j0j4&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;es_sm=0&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=gun+terror+watch+list&amp;tbm=nws', 'the current Google news feed');" target="_blank">the current Google news feed</a></strong>.

<p>What happened in Paris was entirely predictable, and in a rational society, would be significantly more preventable.  Combine an influx of members of cultures inimical to Western values with edicts prohibiting citizens from the means of personal defense, and the only surprise is it’s taken this long.</p>
<p>So what else do we see from the media?</p>
<p>We see <strong><a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/11/14/the-thin-blue-line-between-isis-and-you.html" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/11/14/the-thin-blue-line-between-isis-and-you.html', 'police state cheerleader Michael Daly');" target="_blank">police state cheerleader Michael Daly</a></strong> ignoring the fact the terrorists were able to get military grade weaponry in spite of draconian French citizen disarmament laws and charging “such a group in America would have had an even easier time acquiring weapons than do their murderous counterparts in France. Thanks to the National Rifle Association and its friends in Congress, simply being on the terrorist watchlist does not bar you from acquiring an assault rifle. One federal database might keep a guy off an airplane while another would clear him to arm himself with enough firepower for a massacre.”</p>
<p>Like they would go to a gun shop for full-autos and “suicide” vests… and like being told they were prohibited wouldn’t tip them off the government was on to them.</p>
<p>It’s insane. Here’s just a sampling of how the public is being manipulated:</p>
<p>French citizens angered by the betrayal of their sovereignty by their government and who want their country back are <strong><a href="http://www.express.co.uk/news/world/619463/Paris-attacks-Anti-Muslim-protests-Islam-France-terrorism" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.express.co.uk/news/world/619463/Paris-attacks-Anti-Muslim-protests-Islam-France-terrorism', 'portrayed by the media as “far right extremists');" target="_blank">portrayed by the media as “far right extremists</a></strong>.” This at a time when the Islamic State is bragging it has <strong><a href="http://www.express.co.uk/news/world/555434/Islamic-State-ISIS-Smuggler-THOUSANDS-Extremists-into-Eur" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.express.co.uk/news/world/555434/Islamic-State-ISIS-Smuggler-THOUSANDS-Extremists-into-Eur', 'smuggled thousands of its jihadists into Europe');" target="_blank">smuggled thousands of its jihadists into Europe</a></strong>.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.infowars.com/merkel-calls-for-tolerance-towards-migrants-after-paris-massacre/" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.infowars.com/merkel-calls-for-tolerance-towards-migrants-after-paris-massacre/', 'German Chancellor Angela Merkel');" target="_blank">German Chancellor Angela Merkel</a></strong>, who has done more to sell out her people than perhaps anyone since the guy holding down the job in the Thirties and Forties, “responded to the Paris massacre by calling for ‘tolerance’ towards migrants and respect…” Her sentiments were echoed and amplified by Madonna, who also called for <strong><a href="http://www.ammoland.com/2015/11/madonnas-call-for-unconditional-love-doesnt-apply-to-her-armed-guards/" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.ammoland.com/2015/11/madonnas-call-for-unconditional-love-doesnt-apply-to-her-armed-guards/', 'giving ISIS terrorists  “unconditional love');" target="_blank">giving ISIS terrorists  “unconditional love</a></strong>.”</p>
<p>And the problem isn’t just with “progressives.” It’s also with those the establishment wants us to think of as “conservatives.”</p>
<p>We see presidential hopeful Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham trying to double funding to <strong><a href="http://www.wnd.com/2015/11/forget-paris-gop-candidate-to-double-funding-for-refugees/" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.wnd.com/2015/11/forget-paris-gop-candidate-to-double-funding-for-refugees/', 'bring 100,000 Syrian Muslims to the U.S.');" target="_blank">bring 100,000 Syrian Muslims to the U.S.</a></strong> We see “<strong><a href="http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/11/16/exclusive-house-freedom-caucus-chairman-no-commitment-paul-ryan-block-import-muslim-refugees/" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/11/16/exclusive-house-freedom-caucus-chairman-no-commitment-paul-ryan-block-import-muslim-refugees/', 'no commitment');" target="_blank">no commitment</a></strong>” from new Republican Speaker of the House Paul Ryan “to curb the nation’s importation of Muslims on visas.” And now we see Ryan floating additional due process-eviscerating* “<strong><a href="http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/260280-ryan-points-to-mental-health-bill-as-response-to-gun-violence" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/260280-ryan-points-to-mental-health-bill-as-response-to-gun-violence', 'mental health” gun bans');" target="_blank">mental health” gun bans</a></strong> as an in-your-face to every gun owner who ever voted for him.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.sprword.com/books/quigley/" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.sprword.com/books/quigley/', 'A quote');" target="_blank">A quote</a></strong> from Bill Clinton’s college mentor Carroll Quigley comes to mind:</p>
<blockquote><p>The argument that the two parties should represent opposed ideals and policies, one, perhaps, of the Right and the other of the Left, is a foolish idea acceptable only to the doctrinaire and academic thinkers. Instead, the two parties should be almost identical, so that the American people can “throw the rascals out” at any election without leading to any profound or extreme shifts in policy.</p></blockquote>
<p>Here’s the thing: When – not if – threatened attacks happen on U.S. soil, odds are they will also happen in “gun free” zones and in areas administered over by “progressives” – just like Paris. But the fallout will cover us all, as Oath Keepers Editor and Midnight Ride Associate Producer Elias Alias noted in <strong><a href="http://campaign.r20.constantcontact.com/render?ca=b801cc86-1008-4f55-a982-e89e33adb078&amp;c=d6a5a020-cd60-11e3-bc3d-d4ae5275b3f6&amp;ch=d7a583f0-cd60-11e3-bd85-d4ae5275b3f6" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://campaign.r20.constantcontact.com/render?ca=b801cc86-1008-4f55-a982-e89e33adb078&amp;c=d6a5a020-cd60-11e3-bc3d-d4ae5275b3f6&amp;ch=d7a583f0-cd60-11e3-bd85-d4ae5275b3f6', 'his announcement');" target="_blank">his announcement</a></strong> about this coming Friday’s free repeat performance of the documentary:</p>
<blockquote><p>The goal of the “terrorism” is to tighten government control over our lives. Midnight Ride, the documentary film which examines the four types of Martial Law in the bright light of the Constitution, is indeed an extremely important movie. What the French government has done in response to the attacks in Paris is exactly what the ruling elite in America will do to our society if they can successfully execute a similar attack here on U.S. soil – or – if there is a banking failure of serious magnitude, an EMP, or whatever other calamity may chance to afflict our way of life. All Americans need to know what the Constitution says about “emergency powers” (which are not granted in the Constitution), so that we all may reject the coming police state’s tyrannical control over our lives.</p></blockquote>
<p>And the “domestic enemies” who will be cracked down on will be patriots, gun owners, veterans, Oath Keepers…</p>

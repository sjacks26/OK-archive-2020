<p style="text-align: justify;">by Shorty Dawkins</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">President Obama <a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/mar/18/obama-calls-mandatory-voting-us/" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/mar/18/obama-calls-mandatory-voting-us/', 'recently endorsed the concept');" target="_blank">recently endorsed the concept</a>, at least, of mandatory voting. He didn’t say he would push for legislation, but mentioned it would be a means to curb the influence of big money on elections, though how it would accomplish that feat he didn’t say, naturally. This looks to me to be a new meme, along the lines of “inclusiveness” and “openness”, which are hallmarks of the two major political parties, particularly the Democrats. Of course neither Party is really in favor of inclusiveness or openness, the Memes being put out there to deceive the public, as usual. For instance, President Obama made the idea of “openness” an important part of his campaign rhetoric, yet his administration has been the most secretive in history. No surprise there. And by “inclusiveness”, both Parties really mean become like us. By all means, do not hold differing opinions from the Party leadership. Recite the mantra we endorse, they insist, and all will be well. Of course they don’t mention how similar the mantra is for both Parties. They can’t admit that. Good heavens no! And that is the problem. That is perhaps the biggest reason eligible voters choose not to vote.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>What difference does it make?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If there are two political Parties, and both are headed in basically the same direction, why vote? The outcome will be basically the same. Of course, that has been the plan. When you get tired of one Party, throw them out, in disgust, but then the same outcome, with minor variations, unwinds, all the while the two Parties bicker and present their Theater of the Absurd, a circus for us to watch, and to join in, taking partisan sides.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you doubt what I am saying, consider the path we have been on for the last hundred years. Each Congress, each President, in one way or another, has moved us down the path to socialism. Democrats and Republicans alike have pushed the ideas of socialism, all the while proclaiming to be champions of Free Enterprise. Both Parties have been chipping away at the Constitution, all the while proclaiming to be loyal to it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To put it simply, there is no real choice. The two political parties are almost identical, and both are steadily depriving us of our Rights. They proclaim the beauty of the two-party system, which is really a one-party system in disguise, and both continuously deride the creation of new political parties as being disruptive to the two-party system. Of course they won’t publicly state their fear of losing the power they share between them.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>What If …..</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Let’s for a minute suppose that mandatory voting is enacted, (though I doubt it will be). If everyone votes, will they publicly announce the number of blank votes? Of course not, though there could very well be millions of them. And what if neither of the two parties receives more than 30% of the total vote? (How embarrassing!) Who wins? Can any government claim a mandate with less than 30% support? Not truthfully. And what of those who left their ballots blank? Where does that take us?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Governments, if they are not outright dictatorships, need to pretend they have the consent of the governed. And that is what the meme of mandatory voting is about: pretending they have consent. They proclaim a lack of public dissent is, in reality, consent, though they do everything in their power to stifle dissent. The meme of the “consent of the governed” is all-important to them. And it is their weakness. If mandatory voting were to be instituted, I would turn in a blank ballot, (if I voted at all, which is not out of the realm of possibility). I would then look to see if the vote totals for the “accepted parties” came anywhere near the number of votes cast. Of course the voting process is rife with corruption, and the totals are rigged, but it would be curious to watch them twist themselves into knots, trying to justify their “mandates”. It could get interesting.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Not Voting Is A Choice</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I leave you with one thought. Not voting is a choice, also. If there is no one to represent you, the act of not voting is a viable choice. You are saying your ideas, your choices, are not being represented, so you are opting out of the charade.</p>

Stewart Rhodes: [00:00:00] My name is Stewart Rhodes. I'm the founder of Oath Keepers. We are all Americans. We all share a common ground of our Declaration and our Constitution and in particular our Bill of Rights. That's our common ground. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:00:16] Our mission is simply to use the First Amendment to reach out and remind all active duty military police and firefighters of their civic obligation and their legal duty and responsibilities under Article 6 of the US Constitution. The oath is not a good idea or some tradition that we just do. It's a requirement it's a legal requirement. So our mission is simply to remind them of that oath. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:00:47] The fact that it is to the law the oath is to the highest law of the land and in this country the Constitution reigns not some man or woman. It's not an oath to an individual. Now the founders were no dummies that did this for a good reason. Throughout history the oath was to the king because who own the country? The king owned the country right. Divine Right of Kings. So of course the office was to a person and even in modern times even after the fall of monarchy you had an oath to individuals the oath in Nazi Germany was to the fuhrer. You know the oath was there was I swear to to obey the fuhrer and give my life for the future. Now why was that. Because in that country in Nazi Germany Hitler's word was law. Opened his mouth, the law emanated. That's what a dictator is. He dictates just by talking. He opens his mouth he becomes law. He is the law. He is the nation so the oath is to him. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:01:47] And this country in sharp contrast, the oath is to no man to no woman no individual. Now why is that. Because we live under the rule of law not of men. That's what a republic is and it's not a democracy. You look in the Constitution you'll never see the word democracy used anywhere in there nor in the declaration of independence is nowhere to be found. Yes the government is established by the consent of the people as the declaration makes clear. Deriving their just powers from that from their consent. But it's not majority rule. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:02:21] That's what a democracy is. Democracy is 51 percent get to tell the 49 percent what to do Absolutely, no restraints on their power. No limitations. In such a system as that as Madison pointed out the minority whether it be a racial minority whether it be a cultural or religious minority our political minority the minority is in a put up a creek without a paddle because the majority can reign over them and tyrannize over them at will and in a real democracy a real democracy is what put Socrates to death. They don't like the way he was talking to the youth. They put him to death by a vote. That's what a democracy is. Or some have said a democracy is two wolves and a sheep deciding what's for dinner. OK the minority will always fare worse of any kind in a democracy. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:03:12] That's why the founders set up a constitutional republic. Now What that means is it's a republic in the sense of Representatives and also in the sense of multiple sovereignties coming together in multiple states. But even above them when they send us someone to Washington D.C. as a representative they don't go there and just do what they want. It's not a representative democracy. They don't is rule by majority rule. They passed legislation by majority rule. But what's higher than legislation. The Constitution. So the Constitution is the highest law of the land not the will of Congress on any vote. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:03:49] If their rule, if their law that they pass is contrary to the Constitution as the Supreme Court has said many times it is null and void as if never enacted in the first place. A law contrary to the Constitution is null and void, has no force of law. A law that violates freedom of speech for example, a law that bans criticism of the president for example like the Alien and Sedition Acts and that turmoil and anxiety over perceived domestic enemies aiding foreign enemies like we have now. You have had anxiety and desire there to be able to reach out and stop the criticism of political opponents and they passed the alien and sedition act which were a direct violation of the first amendment. Almost immediately after it was enacted. Pretty sad history frankly. This is what happens in times of trouble and turmoil and fear that people will react by trying to tear down the constitutional barriers and get at their political opponents. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:04:49] So there's an example right there of a statute that was passed that was in violation clear inviolate clear violation of the First Amendment. Hopefully you will have legislatures who won't dare pass such a statute. They should look at every bill and take personal responsibility for making a determination of whether or not that legislation has been proposed that bill whether or not it complies with the Constitution. isn't that correct. Shouldn't they make an individual decision about that. And yet all too often Congress and other legislatures will defer that decision to the courts. They'll just vote on whatever they think is right. Leaving it to the courts to sort out what is constitutional. now is that in keeping with their oath. How is that supporting the Constitution the United States. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:05:33] It's not. so that's why I started this organization because I understand looking at the history that you can't count on the political process to always keep violations from happening nor can you always count on the courts as the Alien and Sedition Acts show. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:05:54] This is what happens with courts also during times of emergency. During World War II, you had Korematsu which was the case that upheld the internment of over 100000 citizens the United States of Japanese descent. The court figured out some way to explain away that as being necessary for national survival. Where'd they get that. Is that in the Constitution that if the nation's survival is at stake according to the court they can give a pass to something that otherwise would be obviously unconstitutional. No it's not. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:06:25] There's no escape clause in the Constitution for government to do whatever it thinks it needs to do of any branch including including the legislative the judicial branch. Whenever they feel like they have to do it it doesn't exist. But yet in times of emergency it happens. As corrupt and rotten as professional politicians are and as corrupt and rotten as the party leadership is, sad to say in almost every state on both parties. The rank and file out there the people of this country still have principles and they're still willing to do what's right. So I looked at that and said Well holy cow Let's stop worrying about what's going on with these people up here. Let's stop going to the to the political elites hat in hand asking them to respect the constitution to respect the boundaries to respect our rights. Instead let's go around them. Let's ignore them for a while. Well not entirely. But let's focus our effort on each other on making sure that we are constitutionalists making sure that we honor our oaths and by doing so what ever they decide they're going to do in our little secret meetings in a smoke filled room or whatever they're doing they can't enforce that, they can't put that upon us without our consent. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:07:47] And so for too long people have assumed that the police will just do whatever they're told. They assume the military will just do whatever they're told because we are in our constitutional ignorance, we have forgotten about the oath, a common bond, a common bond of brotherhood and sisterhood, all willing to give their lives, their fortunes, their sacred honor. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:08:15] That's what this organization is about, is to heal those divisions to heal those fears to break down those false walls, to reunite the American people with their fellow citizens who are police and military and to reacquaint them with us, make it very clear to them we've got your back. We support you so long as you keep your oath. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:08:41] We do want the military and police to keep their oath. We'd like them all to keep their oaths. But the focus on the military and police is precisely because we see the dishonor and the deviousness among politicians and judges who would violate their oaths. And we want to make sure that if they willfully violate their oaths it won't be the end of our republic. Plain and simple. OK. Whenever that comes to that day comes, we want to be a thing where they go look we can't do it. All these people are saying that are going to keep their oaths. Just keep your oath. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:09:17] And is not to the ten orders you will not obey. That's a teaching tool that's a good example that we think. If you disagree fine. Just be sincere in your defense know the constitution and then have the the personal integrity and honesty in dealing with each other and everybody else. It's your conduct that's going to matter. Like Washington said on the eve of the battle of Long Island that's the quote we use he said the future of this nation whether Americans will be free whether their children will be free depends upon the conduct of this army, that's what he said. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:09:56] Well for all of us all the American people whether our children will be free depends upon our conduct, not to just in capacity as Oath Keepers or police or military or whether we are, as Americans. It's our responsibility. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:10:11] So that's why in this organization the bedrock is good will, its integrity, its honesty, and its civility and we insist upon it. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:10:27] This is what Americans do. They step up. You don't wait for somebody else to do it. You see some that needs to be done you step up and you do it. That's our mission here with the Oath Keepers is to make sure that we remind those in service about their obligations under that civic duty.

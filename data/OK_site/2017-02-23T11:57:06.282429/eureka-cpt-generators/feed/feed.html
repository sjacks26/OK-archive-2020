It depends on if you want to be off-grid. Off-grid property can be very cheap near Eureka.

<content:encoded>Thanks, hey we all make this kind of error now and then, you know either the fingers getting ahead of the mind or the mind getting ahead of the fingers.
<p>People really need to read up on this type of subject for sure. Need to learn the differences of Clean and  Dirty Sine Wave as well as Frequency control of the Gen. All of course are not created equal and running a modern Refer off a dirty sine wave that is not within spec of the 60Hz will have unwelcome surprise.</p>
<p>Tried to find your email in Member List, no luck.</p>
<p>Thanks again for a needed article.</p>

<content:encoded>Ron, My mistake. That should read 240 volts, not amps. I’ll change that in a minute.<br/>
Regards factoring in higher wattage than rated: It is presumed that not everything kicks on at once. Also, any lights in use will merely dim. The rating given on the device should be for “Maximum Start-up”. “Running time” will be less.
<p>Thanks for your noticing my mistake.</p>

<content:encoded>Mr. Dawkins would you clarify the section of your very good article about well pumps possibly drawing 240Amps? If this is correct at what voltage, 125V or 220-240V? If drawing (240A * 125V = 30,000Wsec) the at say (240A * 220V = 52,800Wsec), did I miss something here? I also wonder about the Generators, aren’t they rated in both Peak Power and Continuous Power? I have seen during hurricanes people burning out generators because they thought you could draw 5200W Peak from a 4700W Continuous Rating Unit. Again another thought, don’t many motors such as AC Units draw a considerable additional Power at initial Startup and then settle down during operation? If the Peak draw is not know or the Peak output from the Generator is exceeds for any length of time, I think maybe smoke?
<p>Looking forward to you article on Solar, good this info is getting out there.</p>

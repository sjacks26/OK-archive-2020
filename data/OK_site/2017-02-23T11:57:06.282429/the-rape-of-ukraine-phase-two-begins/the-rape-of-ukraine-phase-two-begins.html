<p>By F. William Engdahl</p>
<p>An legitimately-elected (said by all international monitors) Ukrainian President, <strong>Viktor Yanukovich</strong>,  has been driven from office, forced to flee as a war criminal after  more than three months of violent protest and terrorist killings by  so-called opposition. His “crime” according to protest leaders was  that he rejected an EU offer of a vaguely-defined associate EU  membership that offered little to Ukraine in favor of a concrete deal  with Russia that gave immediate €15 billion debt relief and a huge  reduction in Russian gas import prices. Washington at that point went  into high gear and the result today is catastrophe.</p>
<p><strong>A secretive</strong> <strong>neo-nazi military organization reported linked to NATO played a decisive role in targeted sniper attacks</strong> <strong>and violence that led to the collapse of the elected government.</strong></p>
<p>But  the West is not finished with destroying Ukraine. Now comes the IMF  with severe conditionalities as prerequisite to any Western financial  help.</p>
<p>After the famous leaked phone call of US Assistant Secretary of State <strong>Victoria Nuland </strong>(photo,  left) with the US Ambassador in Kiev, where she discussed the details  of who she wanted in a new coalition government in Kiev, and where she  rejected the EU solutions with her “Fuck the EU” comment,<a>[1]</a> the EU went it alone. Germany’s Foreign Minister, Frank-Walter  Steinmeier proposed that he and his French counterpart, Laurent Fabius,  fly to Kiev and try to reach a resolution of the violence before  escalation. Polish Foreign Minister, Radoslaw Sikorski was asked to  join. The talks in Kiev included the EU delegation, Yanukovich, the  three opposition leaders and a Russian representative. The USA was not  invited.<a>[2]</a></p>
<p>The EU intervention without Washington was extraordinary and reveals  the deeping division between the two in recent months. In effect it was  the EU saying to the US State Department, “F*** the US,” we will end  this ourselves.</p>
<p>After hard talks, all major parties including the  majority of protesters, agreed to new presidential elections in  December, return to the 2004 Constitution and release of <strong>Julia Tymoshenko</strong> from prison. The compromise appeared to end the months long chaos and give a way out for all major players.</p>
<p>The diplomatic compromise lasted less than twelve hours. Then all hell broke loose.</p>

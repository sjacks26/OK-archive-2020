Alex Jones: [00:00:00] Rhodes, founder of Oath Keepers a year ago exploding all over the country and the world is our guest. Tell us briefly about Oath keepers. Go over the ten orders you will not follow. This will Hamstring the Achilles heel of the New World Order. and let's get into your home safe Program. 

Alex Jones: [00:00:18] Ladies and Gentlemen this is real. foreign offshore banks have seized the United States. we're being censored and infowarsdotcom prison planet dotcom. They don't want you to see follow the Republic The Obama Deception. I mean I sell the DVDs of my films but it's free and high quality on YouTube. Take advantage of these $200000 films. Give me It took me two hundred thousand bucks to make. It's free to you. I'm for real. We have a vision of defending the Republic. I want to add. Jason Bermas is coming up for three hours after us. Stewart Rhodes is going to be with him for the whole first hour. so the infowars.Dotcom streams are local AM and FM. While you can still get it. Stewart I want to get to into Oath keepers but people better use the Internet while they've got it. That's right. Use it or lose it. Okay, get into old keepers. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:01:08] The whole point of the Oath Keepers is the Founders were smart enough to make the oath to the Constitution not to any man or office. and so we are reminding all the police and military that they took a constitutionally required oath to support and defend that document against all enemies foreign and domestic. The It's very powerful weapon on our side. So focus is there. Remind them of the oath and teach them more about the constitution. They've been intentionally dumbed down and kept ignorant through public schooling and also lack of education on the Constitution In the military. they are not taught about the Bill of Rights in the military. So we're going to make sure they know what they're doing. 

Alex Jones: [00:01:44] The good news is though when I say that the military is on fire with Oath keepers the 3 percenters they are. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:01:49] They are absolutely. They understand that something's wrong. Many of them are very traditional Americans and very sincere Patriots and so we know they have the courage, but courage without knowledge will not be sufficient. 

Alex Jones: [00:02:02] It Will be used by evil. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:02:03] That's right. Courage. That's right, it can be can be twisted into thinking that you're being patriotic by defending that of the people against these evil extremist haters. And so that's that's that's that's a tactic of our enemies. but our tactic is to remind them of the basic knowledge we're trying to impart about our Bill of Rights, about the declaration of independence, the core principles of. 

Alex Jones: [00:02:22] Because it's a hedge when you don't have that you're just like North Korea or Mexico. Mexico has triple the resources we do there in squalor and tyranny because they have a corrupt system. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:02:32] Well sure that mean the whole point of America is liberty. The Declaration of Independence makes very clear whole point of the government is to secure your natural rights. 

Alex Jones: [00:02:39] Meanwhile FEMA is running around demonizing the founding fathers. Stewart go over the ten orders you will not follow. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:02:44] Well the Ten Orders are not the oath. A lot of folks were kind of mistaken about that. The oath is to the Constitution that we all swore our public services. but this declaration, the whole point of this is that get them thinking about the very clear lines in the sand. The most dangerous stuff. It's not everything that will be unconstitutional. I get emails from guys saying all what about posse comitatus. You know you mention that. Well this is only a start, but these are the most dangerous ones. Number one we will not obey any order to disarm the American people because that is what led to fighting in the first American Revolution. 

Alex Jones: [00:03:14] 1775. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:03:15] You betcha. So after all the abuse that they had suffered of all of all their other natural rights, it was the attempt to disarm them that finally got got to the point where they had to fight back. Number two is we will not obey orders to conduct warrantless searches of the American people, their homes, vehicles papers or facts, such as warrantless house to house searches for weapons or persons. And that happened during Katrina. 

Alex Jones: [00:03:35] The first thing they went for was the guns in the high and dry areas. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:03:38] That's right. So people say well you're being paranoid it's never happened in America. 

Alex Jones: [00:03:42] They're having knock and talk everywhere. They're shut down gun shows without laws. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:03:46] That's a very, here in Austin that's right. now that that was a terrible example of arbitrary and capricious fiat law. No law at all just rule by by Authority saying I'm going to do this, right. No law passed by Congress. The ATF just came in and said you cannot have private sales inside of the gun show. Yep so number three is we will not obey any orders to detain American citizens as unlawful enemy combatants or subject them to trial by military tribunal. And this claim power is to me that the most dangerous is the claim that the president as commander in chief, Can apply the laws of war to you and I, American citizens. 

Alex Jones: [00:04:21] Notice they are now saying we will kill U.S. citizens. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:04:24] Right, they'll target U.S. citizens. And what is the difference between targeting a U.S. citizen in the Sudan and one here. Where is the constitutional separation between those two things. Its not there. If they can do it over there they'll do it here too. But Deo was arrested in Chicago O'Hare International Airport. Doesn't make a difference where you are. 

Alex Jones: [00:04:41] And we don't give up our Bill of Rights because of some fake boogeyman it's come out the underwear bomber was protected by the government, that's mainstream news. Go ahead. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:04:48] Well the basic point is whether or not an American citizen is actually making war in his own country the remedy is the article. 

Alex Jones: [00:04:54] They get due process because they throw out the entire due process if we don't. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:04:58] Absolutely if you're so afraid of of Islamic terror that you're willing to tear apart the Bill of Rights and throw it away. You'll wind up a Nazi Germany. 

Alex Jones: [00:05:05] Which we are now doing. Go ahead. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:05:07] That's exactly right. Number four is we will not obey orders to impose martial law or a state of emergency on any state or enter with force into a state without the express consent and invitation of the state's legislature. 

Alex Jones: [00:05:18] You have to do that because the John Warner Defense Authorization Act says even if the governor say no we're going to do it. And now he's created a puppet 10 member governorship. They claim he has power over the states and they admit they are taking over the states and a secret homeland security documents admit it's actually for take over of America. I mean we have the documents this is for the American people not for guys in turbans. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:05:38] That's the whole point of the council of governors is to circumvent the requirement of the of the authorization of state legislature. Article 4 Section 4 of the Constitution says that only upon the application the state legislature or if they can't be convened the executive, can the feds come in even to stop an insurrection against the state. Like say it is insurrection against the government of Texas and they want to and the feds want to come in to stop that. They can't do anything without the invitation of your legislature or your governors. 

Alex Jones: [00:06:04] Because The states created the federal government go ahead. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:06:06] That's exactly right. So number five is we will not obey orders to invade and subjugate any state that asserts its sovereignty and declares a national government to be in violation of the compact by which that state entered the union. We are a dual sovereignty system. States have the power and the responsibility to intercede and guard that. 

Alex Jones: [00:06:25] And now a whole bunch of attorney generals and states are moving to block unconstitutional gun laws, Government health care, everything and the feds are moving in continue. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:06:33] With their asserting their sovereignty. It's it's a to-. Two systems. If these states were to interfere with that with the sovereign sphere of the national government they will defend that. It's. 

Alex Jones: [00:06:44] Everything is the separation of powers. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:06:46] That's right. We will not obey orders to blockade American citizens cities thus turning them into detention camps. 

Alex Jones: [00:06:53] And that's the in all these executive orders this biological attack order. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:06:58] It Also was done during Katrina. People were not allowed to leave out of New Orleans across the bridge. It's in our film it's on our Web site. At oathkeepers.org, you can go there and watch that video. We have clips of Shepard Smith from Fox News standing on the bridge saying they will not let them cross this bridge to get out of their. 

Alex Jones: [00:07:13] Continue. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:07:14] We will not obey any order to enforce America to force American citizens into any form of detention camps under any pretext. And that was done already in our history to the Japanese Americans. 

Alex Jones: [00:07:24] And the Italians and we now have the national emergency centers act that admits they built the camps. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:07:31] That's exactly right. They're putting together. A lot of this stuff is dual use. They'll put together a detention center or an emergency center supposedly for refugees from other countries et cetera. But they always have dual use. 

Alex Jones: [00:07:42] Well back in 99 with that staged event in the Seattle the WTO they put them on the Sandpoint naval FEMA brig and. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:07:51] Also in New York City to. 

Alex Jones: [00:07:53] Pier 57. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:07:54] We will not obey orders to assist or support the use of any foreign troops on U.S. soil against the American people to keep the peace or to maintain control. 

Alex Jones: [00:08:02] We know the Army War College is teaching they'll use foreign troops in LEO 9 last year FEMA with 14 nations trained to quote take on American terrorists. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:08:10] We also had also had a weird thing where you had foreign troops training with our National Guard across the country. You had Uzbekistani troops up in Montana of all places. And once again it's an example of dual use. They say that they're for only training them to go back home and do it. 

Alex Jones: [00:08:24] Then they admit it's for domestic use Go ahead. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:08:26] Right. We will not obey orders too. So there we would consider such use of foreign troops against our people to be an invasion and an act of war. Number nine we will not obey any order to confiscate the property of the American people, including food and other essential supplies, Under any emergency pretext. 

Alex Jones: [00:08:43] And that's an executive orders. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:08:46] Oh absolutely. 

Alex Jones: [00:08:46] Take the food. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:08:47] It's also been used historically as a weapon of war as well. No easier way to subjugate the people than to cause a famine or to confiscate like was done to the Kulaks. But by Stalin. So number 10 is that we will not obey any order which infringes on the right of the people to free speech, to peaceably assemble, or to petition their government for redress of grievances. 

Alex Jones: [00:09:07] And we have the free speech zones, we have the provocateurs they hire to go to events, we have the clear program going on of restriction. Let's talk about the new programs that Oath Keepers are launching. I want to tell listeners again infowars.com 

Alex Jones: [00:09:25] Foreign banks engineered the banking collapse. They're meeting secretly in Australia according to the news of Australia. They are coming in with this criminal take-over. They are not going to be able to get away with their crimes if the people stand up against them. That's why they're coming in to censor the Web now. They can stage fake attacks on the Internet as a pretext to shut it down. They're saying that's basically what they're going to do. The underwear bomber, it's even in the Detroit newspapers, was let on the plane, protected by the U.S. government. In every case you are

SR: It’s interesting we’re talking about the oath. I always tell people, OK didn’t invent the oath. It’s been there since the founding of the nation, it’s right there in the Constitution itself. I now these discussions have always been going on among people. It’s good to hear one more confirmation that people in the military are waking up, they’re discussing the oath. You were talking about this in 2004. My enemies, even if you kill me or find some way to stamp out OK, it doesn’t matter cause the oath is already there and guys like this are in the military and they’re not going anywhere.

JM: And I have friends.

SR: And he has friends, and you don’t even know who they are. So you can’t stop it. It was already from the beginning designed to be this way. (0:00:48.5) The Founders put it there for a reason. The genie is out of the bottle. They’re going to talk about the Constitution whether you like it or not. They’re gonna learn whether you like it or not. It doesn’t matter whether I’m around. Do what you want with OK, it doesn’t make a difference. Thank you for your service and for being a stand up guy. Thanks for taking the risk to talk to us. Of course, this isn’t an ongoing operation you’re talking about, this is the past. But I think it’s important for people to know that Katrina was a wake up call. It can happen here, it has happened here. Gun confiscation happened in Katrina. I was just talking to Bill O’Reilly, he said this is never gonna happen. Well it happened right there. This is a good example. People do contact us and say how come no one stood up, how come no one stood down or refused to go along with those orders. The perception is that the military is going to blindly follow orders. We know that’s not the case.

JM: Not me and my buddies, anyway. (0:01:43.3)

SR: Whenever I go across the country talking to folks, I hear that all the time. So you’re not alone. But it’s good to hear that this is how you felt during Katrina and you did stand down. When you went into New Orleans, you knew there was an order from the police chief to disarm people. And what did you say to that?

JM: I said not doing it.

JM: (0:02:10.9) I’d like to put a challenge out to my fellow service members mostly. Same challenge my buddy gave me years ago. Know your Constitution. Know why you put your hand up and said yes I will. You need to understand that and what your obligation to that is. If you remember your oath, you solemnly swore to do that, so help you god. Take it seriously. Get real. Figure out what it is. Get your pocket Constitution like I have, walk around with it and understand what you swore to uphold and defend. That’s all I have to say.

SR: One point of clarification. Sometimes our enemies will say, they’re ignoring the part of the oath that says I’ll obey the orders of the President and the officers appointed over me.

JM: It says lawful order.

SR: Subject to the UCMJ, that means only lawful orders. Well, I really do appreciate you. Just for the record, he’s not a member of OK, never even heard of us. We welcome him aboard if he wants to, but I don’t really care about that. I care that, it warms my heart to know there are guys like this who are constitutionalists in the military who are doing the right thing, being a vocal minority. It only takes one guy to step up and tip the balance towards the Constitution.

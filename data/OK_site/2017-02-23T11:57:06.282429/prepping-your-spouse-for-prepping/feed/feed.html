<content:encoded>I agree!! I ditched my wife of 30 yrs. I connected with my old gal before I got married; for the past 3yrs we have been together sharing the same political views. My wife  had no clue, she is a blind sheep, like the rest of the herds.

<content:encoded>If you have a problem with the significant other on the current state of affairs and your significant other is aware of the current state of the Union, then you married the wrong personâ€¦. You need to get this straight before you commit, really. The only marriage that lasts is one where you both are almost twins in your views of the world and events. I can speak from a solid base, just enjoyed our 46th year and we are in lock step, never a need for one to convince the other.

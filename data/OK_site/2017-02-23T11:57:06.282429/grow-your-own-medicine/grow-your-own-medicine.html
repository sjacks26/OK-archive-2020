<p style="text-align: justify;">In a speech in New York State, Stewart Rhodes recently put the call out: <a href="../index.html?p=7071" target="_blank"><span style="color: #0000ff;">OATH KEEPERS URGE PREPARATION FOR ECONOMIC COLLAPSE</span></a>. So, what does it mean to prepare for an economic collapse? Obviously stockpiling food is at the top of the list, followed by guns and ammo, to protect your family and your stored food, but close behind these two needs are medicines. As has been seen in Greece, and other collapsing economies, food and medicines are quick to disappear from store shelves. We all know medicines are expensive, so, with a limited budget, what can you do? Well, we advise you to learn to grow your own food, and to also grow and make your own natural, herbal remedies.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Many modern medicines are derived from plants, of one kind or another. The pharmaceutical industry has, for years, known the benefits of plants and uses them to make medicines they can patent. Herbs and plants were used for thousands of years to treat a whole host of ailments. And they were effective remedies. Your grandparents, no doubt, had many favorite home remedies. It is this knowledge that is being lost. It is this knowledge that we need to reclaim.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I recently came across a BBC show called, Grow Your Own Medicines. It is a decent show, though not extensive in its scope, that gives the viewer lots of useful knowledge on how to grow and to prepare your medicinal plants for a variety of illnesses. James Wong is what he calls an ethno-biologist, and in each of thirteen shows that are available on YouTube, he teaches the viewer how to make some ointments, tinctures, infusions, teas, or balms, to treat diseases or conditions. For the beginner, these shows are very good. Using plants and herbs available in most Natural Food Stores, or found in your backyard, or a nearby field, he, step by step, walks you through the creation of the desired remedy. He also gives tips on growing them, based on his living in the UK.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Creating your own medicines is a good deal cheaper than buying them at the pharmacy, and you can be assured of the contents of your medicines as a side benefit. As James Wong shows, it is not difficult to make your own home remedies, using the wisdom of the ages, and some innovations of his own design.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I urge you to begin learning about herbal medicines. When the stores are empty, you can still have medicines for you, your family and your neighbors.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">All 13 of the shows are available to be seen, and can be accessed on the right sidebar on the you tube page.</p>

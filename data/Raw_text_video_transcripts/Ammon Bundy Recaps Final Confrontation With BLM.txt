SR: AB was recapping strategy and what went down today. Reports are saying we’re encouraging terrorism, which is nonsense.

AB: My father had talked with the county sheriff. We rallied and the people supported us. When we had the most public support, we gave the sheriff an ultimatum: called the sheriff to his duties and made him choose in front of the people whether he would do his duty. (0:01:14.1)

SR: That was this morning about 9, 9:30?

AB: Yeah. He chose not to. We gave him one hour to do certain things, basically take his duties back, disarm the BLM. That didn’t happen. Also, it was the media’s responsibility to find out whether this happened, and the sheriff was supposed to report back. (0:01:56.0) That didn’t happen. After the deadline, my father let the people decide how much longer we wanted to give him. The people said 5 minutes. We waited another 5 minutes, it didn’t happen, so we rolled in and confronted them. Our intent was peaceful, although we did have militia and weapons. That was important because they didn’t know for sure if we were gonna fire on them (0:02:45.5). Our intent was to “make a big enough stink” that the sheriff would come get it done. Meanwhile, there’s a faceoff, and my father is asking the county sheriff to do his job. Because of pressure from the press, the sheriff sent a deputy down and did his job. 

SR: (0:03:35.6) This is after. First, the sheriff showed up and said BLM is going to open the range and stop rounding up cattle. But the question was what would happen with the cattle they already took.

AB: The people were asking that, but my father said that’s not good enough. You need to disarm them.

SR: That’s what he wanted the sheriff to do?

AB: Yep.

SR: So that’s the background. They had already backed off, but they still had your cattle. So you confronted them with the goal of getting the sheriff to step up. What happened when the Las Vegas Metro showed up. (0:04:18.6)

AB: Before they showed up, we had a heated dialogue, where BLM tried to get us to back down, which weren’t going to do. Once the deputy came down, we stopped talking to the BLM agent and went to the deputy. We said this man [the BLM agent] does not have authority, this man [the deputy] does. We asked the deputy what he wanted to happen, and we got the deputy to get the BLM to back down. We had backed down a bit, they were slow to do so. We said if we’ve won this thing, why are they still there? He went back and literally got them all out of there. That was all done through the sheriff.

SR: What I saw was Metro stepped in, BLM left, Metro took over. You went in and took your cattle back. (0:05:37.9)

AB: I walked where we couldn’t be, the deputies were there, they didn’t even question me. I wanted to make a political statement, the deputy wasn’t sure, I said I would go higher up his chain of command if I needed to. He didn’t want looting. BLM was far gone. I agreed that I’d only have 10 people down there and we’d lay things down. Then we shook all their hands and said thank you, we respect you. There was tremendous respect to the deputies.

SR: That’s how it should be (0:06:42.2).

AB: The county sheriff, we’re gonna try to get him gone gone gone.

TC (Reporter for Northern Nevada Fox News affiliate): I was there when cows were released. Could you tell us what time the Feds left and what time your cows came back. Most importantly, what are the condition of your cattle?

AB: (0:07:16.1) Time frames were very short. My father made them very short. Once we got them to give up, he gave them 30 minutes for the first one to roll out. Cattle’s feet were sore, they were run really hard. They were run hard then captured and put in a pen, so their muscles were sore. We found several dead animals and calves separated from their mothers. We don’t know what’s on the range yet.

SR: You probably expect a lot of dead cattle, right? (0:08:10.8)

AB: Certainly. The way they were treating them.

SR: They were run with a helicopter, right?

AB: Yeah, run with a helicopter, and that’ll separate cows from calves. This is our calving season. You run them so hard you could run them to death. Or their feet get really sore. They lose a lot of weight.

SR: When you gather them, you use traps. You lure them in with food and water and trap them in a little corral. It’s a slow process. They’re trying to get them out as fast as possible, probably killing a bunch in the process (0:08:50.6).

AB: Absolutely.

TC: I saw a young one, it still has the umbilical cord attached and it hasn’t eaten yet. What would you say to Americans who are still under the assumption this is about protecting a desert tortoise? (0:09:12.4)

AB: It is a complete farce. The desert tortoise is a tool to get the people’s sympathy so the BLM can do what they want. That’s what it is.

SR: What’s the message to the American people? Why is this a significant moment?

AB: Because we the people expressed our power and the sheriff, representing that power, took control of the county. If he will continue to do that, the people’s rights will be maintained. So it’s about state and county sovereignty. And about governors and sheriffs doing their job to protect the agency of man. (0:10:10.6)

SR: It was wonderful to see Michelle Fiore and other Nevada state legislators, Arizona state legislators coming Monday or tomorrow. It’s critical to see legislators standing up. So you had good office holders doing their duty under their oath. You had good officers who finally did their duty under their oath. This is a critical example of how to do it right. You had the people, you had good elected representatives, you had officers who did their job. It took people on the other side of the fence doing the right thing too. (0:10:57.9) They deserve a lot of credit for keeping things cool. As far as I’m concerned, this was a combined arms effort, a coalition effort, between your family, standup cowboys, and the people who rallied from all over the country – average Joes and cowboys. You had Sheriff Mack who showed up with his guys. Good sheriffs need to step up across the country, lead by example, get other sheriffs to do their duty. If they won’t do their duty, it’s time for a new sheriff.

AB: Absolutely.

SR: I wanna thank you both [Ammon and Lisa]. You did a good job, you set a good example, so God bless you.

AB: If it’s a model, it’s a model.

SR: You stressed earlier, the point was to get the sheriff to do his duty. It wasn’t to use violence, it was making him see his responsibility.

AB: (0:12:30.9) Because the sheriff is so close to the people, and the people have the power. It’s designed that way. The people’s power and the sheriff. You can do something with protest. If you go too high up, it’s too far to reach.

SR: You’re right. The Founders intended that we both sovereign citizens on our own land. That’s the Jeffersonian ideal. We took care of our own affairs. Beyond that, it was up to the sheriff to keep the peace, with you as the posse. Everything else at the state level, that shouldn’t even affect your daily life. (0:13:20.1) You shouldn’t have to worry about outsiders coming in and trampling your rights. It’s just your sheriff. When the feds come in, it’s the duty of the state to step up. Just as Thomas Jefferson and James Madison said back in 1798 when they wrote the Virginia and Kentucky Resolutions. When the national government violates the Constitution, it’s the duty and obligation of the state to step up and enforce the Constitution. Governor, judges, elected representatives, sheriff, every one of them swore that oath. Have a duty to interpose between the people and the out of control federal government.

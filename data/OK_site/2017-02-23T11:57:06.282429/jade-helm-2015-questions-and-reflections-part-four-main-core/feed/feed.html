<content:encoded>Thank you for all your efforts.   In comment, I would like to contribute a thought I had when listening to DJ.<br/>
She had questioned the reasoning that so few SF people (~12-1600 ) are to be deployed to perform this clusterf#@$..
<p>My thought was that the SF job is to OBSERVE the (accuracy of any simulated) attack or attacks  which may be AI computer generated.in the exercise.  Feedback from the onsite SF observers would be used to help the computer LEARN..   This would of course be completely in line with the duties SF troops have been trained to  carry out in all their operations.</p>
<p>Actually, I truly believe FREEFOR is Screwed unless somehow we can UNPLUG this bastard computer.  The bastard is a faster thinker than my squad leader, and faster acting  than the gunny, and it will not spoof more than once….</p>

<content:encoded>Elias, 
<p>Thank you for all your effort and work in gathering and putting together all this information.  This took a lot of time and effort, and it IS much appreciated.</p>
<p>Sorry all, this will be long, with probably more added as I go through this over and over again.</p>
<p>“We note that neither the American People nor the Congress of the United States of America are party to the transformation.”</p>
<p>Which means that it is TREASON on the part of all involved in this “transformation”. None of this is lawful in any way, with this, “… neither the American People nor the Congress of the United States of America… ” underscoring and making it clear that Jade helm, and all previous actions leading to this is a deliberate attack on US soil against the USA and the American people by domestic traitors and foreign enemies.</p>
<p>Just because the “the Trilateral Commission has absorbed our government from within…” does not absolve those that served/still serve from their own actions, they could have always chosen to KEEP their Oath and honor by standing by this nation, the US Constitution, and the American people.  </p>
<p>The fact that those that SERVE WITHIN our government are “now being used to destroy American sovereignty, our value system, our moral codes, our culture, our social institutions, and indeed our very lives as free Americans” shows that the choice was theirs and they chose being traitors. </p>
<p>This “pet project — the transformation and trans-positioning of America into a “New Economic International Order” is the destruction of America, the American people, the US Constitution and they had to know, and actively participate in this treason – over decades for some them like James Clapper and others; all of those that have served within the US Military of high rank had to know and they did not bring it to the light nor stop it on their own making them TRAITORS also.  </p>
<p>Then we have the three branches of the general government, many of those current and prior are going to be hard pressed defending themselves from treason charges as this IS something they had to be aware of or SHOULD have been since all funding starts from the legislative; while backing up and enforcing those unlawful actions were those serving within the executive and judicial branches.</p>
<p>Personally we need to start bringing charges of treason BEFORE they implement Jade Helm, because there are many ignorant people out there that this will assist them in starting to understand the things they felt were wrong, but were too propagandized and “dumbed down” to even know where to look for answers.  Those charges are something they WILL understand and most will work to learn why the charges were brought and decide who to back.</p>
<p>It is the quickest way to get to the front and open to the people themselves that there is NO such thing as “emergency powers” or “martial law” here in America, and if it is declared it is actually an ATTACK on US soil by enemies both domestic and foreign. That is a very important thing to do quickly, and it IS understandable by all people where some of this is not.</p>
<p>Also, Rand Paul did a great job within the video about Clapper lying and that it is a crime that Clapper needs to be charged and prosecuted for.  </p>
<p>He himself does not seem to really understand the US Constitution because when he said that “… you have a right to privacy, and it should be protected” he seems to not know that under our LEGITIMATE government, the US Constitution, it IS a protected FROM those who serve within our governments Natural Right of the people. What he should have said was that Clapper and company went against the PROTECTED FROM-those-who-serve-within-our -governments, and that protection is in writing! That is something he should have made a point of when bringing up Clappers crime of lying, and quite possibly much more as those actions are treasonous against the people.  </p>
<p>Oh, and guess what, NO ONE WHO SERVES WITHIN OUR GOVERNMENT IS ALLOWED TO DO THINGS IN “SECRET”.</p>
<p>Patrick Henry, American colonial revolutionary: “The liberties of a people never were, nor ever will be, secure, when the transactions of their rulers may be concealed from them.”</p>
<p>Thomas Paine: “A body of men holding themselves accountable to nobody ought not to be trusted by anybody.”</p>
<p>John Adams: “There is danger from all men. The only maxim of a free government ought to be to trust no man living with power to endanger the public liberty.”</p>
<p>Thomas Jefferson: “The opinions of men are not the object of civil government, nor under its jurisdiction.”</p>
<p>Thomas Jefferson: “Tyranny is defined as that which is legal for the government but illegal for the citizenry.”</p>
<p>The problem is that it is not enforced. That the Militia whose duty it is to enforce the laws; including the US Constitution and all that is in Pursuance thereof it, all state Constitutions, has been unlawfully disbanded in some areas of our nation, and much misinformation spread about to discredit the Militias of the several states, etc.</p>
<p>Constitution of the United States of America, Second Amendment:  “A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.”</p>
<p>It is the only thing the founders felt was actually “necessary” within the US Constitution, that without it we would be getting into trouble – and they were once again proved correct.<br/>
US Constitution, Article 1, Section 8, Clause 15: “To provide for calling forth the Militia to execute the Laws of the Union, suppress Insurrections and repel invasions. </p>
<p>The Militia is REQUIRED by our US Constitution.</p>
<p>Clause 16: “To provide for organizing, ARMING, and disciplining, the Militia, and for governing such Part of them as may be employed in the Service of the United States, reserving to the States respectively, the Appointment of the Officers, and the Authority of training the Militia according to the discipline prescribed by Congress”.</p>
<p>How else can a US President have them available so the president can call them out as needed as the ONLY Constitutionally assigned force to execute the Laws of the Union, “counter Invasions” and “Domestic Violence” within our nation? </p>
<p>John Adams: “… The fundamental law of the militia is, that it be created, directed and commanded by the laws, and ever for the support of the laws.”</p>
<p>Alexander Hamilton, Federalist Papers 28: “The militia is a voluntary force not associated or under the control of the States except when called out; [when called into actual service] a permanent or long standing force would be entirely different in make-up and call.” </p>
<p>Thomas Jefferson: “For a people who are free, and who mean to remain so, a well organized and armed militia is their best security.</p>
<p>Tench Coxe: “Who are the militia? are they not ourselves. Is it feared, then, that we shall turn our arms each man against his own bosom. Congress have no power to disarm the militia. Their swords, and every other terrible implement of the soldier, are the birth-right of an American…The unlimited power of the sword is not in the hands of either the federal or state governments but, where I trust in God it will ever remain, in the hands of the people.”</p>
<p>That is the ONLY lawful, constitutionally recognized and required enforcement arm of the nation.</p>
<p>(more, much more to come)</p>
<p>Stay Safe Everyone!</p>
<p>God Bless!!</p>
<p>Molon Labe!!</p>

<content:encoded>It’s a ton to digest, hope to dig in.  I’m down here in so-called “hostile” TX.<br/>
    Whiny formatting Note:  visually, I found the giant photos of the integrated circuit chip bothersome.  I guess it was a fun metaphor–but I got it with the first one.

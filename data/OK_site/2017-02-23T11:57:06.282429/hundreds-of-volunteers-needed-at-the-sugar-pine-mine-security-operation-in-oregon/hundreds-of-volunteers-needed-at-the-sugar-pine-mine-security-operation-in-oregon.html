<p>We need hundreds of volunteers to help secure the mine, and to work in support of the security operation. You do NOT have to be an Oath Keeper member everyone is welcome. We need all people who are willing to stand up for the Constitution. We have had non-members such as Three Percenters volunteers and others from the beginning. If you want to help we will put you to work. We WILL reimburse you for your gas money to get here as long as we receive enough donations to cover that. So far, we have been able to reimburse volunteers for gas and other travel expenses and as long as enough donations come in we will continue to do so.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: If you cannot make it in person to help, at least donate to help pay for the travel expenses of those who can make it. You can donate here:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&amp;hosted_button_id= VCUAB9ZBDNP3G" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&amp;hosted_button_id= VCUAB9ZBDNP3G', '');"><img alt="" src="../wp-content/uploads/2014/08/DONATE-TO-SPM.png"/></a></p>
<p>That link takes you directly to the Josephine County Oath Keepers PayPal account, and all money donated is used exclusively to support this mission of protecting the mine. Priority is given to reimbursing out of state teams who travel long distances, but anyone who shows up will get gas money reimbursed as long as we have sufficient donations.</p>
<p>Why do we need help? It is critical that we protect the mine, and the cabin and equipment at the mine, because of the well documented history of BLM burning down cabins and confiscating property at whim, without due process. We have spoken to multiple miners and even retired BLM officers who have relayed past examples of BLM setting fire to cabins, including occupied cabins (with residents having to scramble out of a burning cabin to avoid being killed). The miners do not trust the BLM for good reason and they fear that once there are not enough security volunteers BLM will drop the hammer on them Burning their cabin and stealing their equipment which is common (which is then held for years, while the miners try to get it back – that is BLM’s standard M.O.). That is why they asked for help in the first place, and that need has not gone away.</p>
<p>It is critical that we support and protect patriotic Americans who are standing up for themselves and their rights. The miners are now making a brave stand against the pattern of BLM abuse that they have suffered for years. We need to stand with them, and you need to stand with them. Please volunteer to help them.</p>
<p>If you show up, we will put you to work. If you are not young and fit enough to pull security at the mine, no sweat. There is plenty of work to go around in the staging area/base camp.</p>
<p>In particular, we need:</p>
<p>HAM radio operators, medical personnel, tactical teams, do it yourself guys, logistics, IT people, patrol and security crews.</p>
<p>We run teams around the clock so we need hundreds of volunteers. It’s time to step up and serve your beliefs. You will learn skills as well that you can take back to your own community.</p>

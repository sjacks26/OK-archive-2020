SR: Here with Eddie and Ada Gilbert. Eddie, you’re current serving police officer in Cleveland, correct?

EG: Yes

SR: Tell us about before that.

EG: I was a Marine in the 70s. I was a North Carolina National Guardsman in the 80s, Ohio National Guardsman in the 90s. (0:00:34.3)

SR: You are still in the military reserve, is that correct?

EG: I’m switching over from the Ohio Military Reserve and I’m going into the Ohio Naval Militia.

SR: You were a Marine, then a police officer in North Carolina, then National Guard, then state military reserve, current serving police officer, now you’re going into the naval militia. Most folks didn’t know Ohio has, very unusual.

EG: Right

SR: Earlier you were telling us that your wife got you off the couch, to get involved, right? (0:01:08.4)

EG: We got married in 1990. She asked me who I was gonna vote for in the next election. I said I don’t vote. She said how can you be a former Marine and not vote? You’re not patriotic? I said yes I am, I vote with my combat boots, with my service weapon. I vote for America. She said that’s talk, you gotta walk it. She held my feet to the fire. Every election, I’m in there voting. Perot, Perot, Buchanan, Ron Paul. But I voted. She’s the reason I decided to do anything.

SR: Ada, what do you think about OK and him doing this?

AG: I think OK is a fantastic organization. Eddie’s the researcher, he had been doing a lot of research. He presented OK to me, said I found this organization who believed in, once we saw the 10 points that were key to what you believe, I was sold on the idea myself. I told Eddie, I’m 100% behind this organization. Whatever you do, I’m going to support you, if you become a part of it. It’s unlike me, but once I went to the website, I joined.

SR: Oh you did?

AG: I did. I really believe in what OK stands for. I’m an avid supporter, looking to step up my support. I always support my husband. It’s good to see that he took my advice and has become involved in doing something other than just saying I vote with my boots. 

SR: I lot of guys are kinda macho, I’m willing to fight for freedom, that enough. And you’re saying it’s not enough.

AG: No. So this is good.

SR: So you didn’t serve in the military yourself.

AG: I didn’t (0:03:12.8). I have a high honor for those who did. I know that because of what guys in all the services did, has given me my freedom in many ways and the freedom of so many people. I support all facets of the services.

SR: Good. Today, did you take part in the oath ceremony?

AG: I sure did. It was a great feeling. I felt like I had served at some points in the military. Just taking the oath, it really meant something to me. It wasn’t just a formality.

SR: Good. Like Commander [can’t hear the name] said, we always tell people you’re welcome to join us and take the oath, but don’t do it unless you’re serious. I have no doubt, you’re pretty serious.

AG: I’m very serious. You’ll see how serious. Just watch for me (0:04:02.7).

SR: A lot of folks don’t realize that you don’t have to be prior service to take part in OK, you can be a citizen OK and help with our mission. Like getting him off the couch is an important part of that.
 AG: Exactly.

SR: Also you stepping out too. Well thank you for coming. It’s funny, a lot of time we’ll hear from police officers or active duty, my wife doesn’t want me to get involved, because she’s worried about my pension, my career. You’re the exact opposite. It’s kind of refreshing to hear a story that’s the opposite.

AG: (0:04:40.9) Yes, Eddie is so passionate about anything military. To be his wife, I couldn’t help but be passionate. I mean I love him so naturally, I’m passionate about a lot of things he’s passionate about as well.

SR: Good. God bless you both. Thank you both for stepping up. Anything else you want to say?

AG: I know this organization is going to do a lot of good for our country. I’m looking forward to that and I’m glad to be a part of it. (0:05:10.1) It means a lot.

SR: What about you, Eddie? Anything you want to say to current serving police officers who are afraid to put name on the line.

EG: Yeah I do. If you swore to support and defend the Constitution, when you became a police officer, you didn’t do it for a paycheck. You can be an electrician and make more money. But you raised that right hand and swore to protect and defend and support the Constitution. All we’re asking is just do it. Step up. Grow a pair. Just say no. If you know it’s wrong, just say Lieutenant, I’m going to do that. I guarantee, 10 other guys on the line with you will say he’s right, we’re not going to do it either. But it’s going to take you to be the first one.

SR: (0:06:05.6) How was it to be a policeman’s wife? What’s your experience like? I’ve heard it’s kind of rough.

AG: Yes. I was glued to the television all the time. Any time the news came on, I was right in front of the TV. Any time I heard about an accident or anything involving a police officer, I was waiting to see who it was. It was funny, I finally talked him into wearing a pager.

SR: So you could page him whenever you wanted?

EG: Oh yeah

AG: I did. We had a funny incident. He was actually in a pursuit, in a backyard with dogs barking, and the pager went off.

EG: I had my gun out. The suspect was on the ground on the other side of the fence. I’m through the fence, telling him stay still, freeze, don’t move. Dogs this far from me. And the pager vibrates. 

AG: Once he told me about that, I sort of backed off a little bit. I just thought I’m going to trust and pray that he’ll be okay. It’s still intense. Even more intense when I see the condition of our economy and crime is at an all-time high. I still worry about him every day. Although he’s not on the streets every day, I still worry about him a lot. 

SR: (0:07:37.6) You’re concerned that with the economy going bad, people are going to be more desperate and more crime?  AG: Yes.

SR: It’s rough.

AG: Yeah. Not just for my husband, anyone’s husband. All of our police officers who are out there on the streets, serving in that capacity. I know it’s a dangerous job.

SR: What did you think of the family safe thing we talked about?

AG: It was running through my mind, what part of that can I participate in? I think it’s a great idea.

SR: You can be a host family (0:08:15.1)

AG: Most definitely.

SR: You’d be an ideal host family. We’d like to have police officers paired up with other police officers and retired.

AG: We’re open to that. It would be good to see that taking place. Anything I can do to assist with that, I’ll be looking for the opportunity.

SR: You bet. There are a ton of other things, that’s just scratching the surface of all the things you can get involved with.

AG: I had a lot of ideas, believe me.

EG: Oh yes.

AG: This spurs a whole other facet of Ada.

SR: Hey, you have a good idea, you just let us know.

AG: One thing is the Oath Kept, I think that’s a nice catch.

SR: Let them know what you said. She wrote on the corner of her piece of paper, Oath Kept.

AG: Yes. I’m not military or a police officer, but I’m kept by the Oath Keeper. So I’m Oath Kept. I thought that was pretty good.

SR: By this one anyway (0:09:20.2)

AG: I’ll see what I can do with that.

SR: I thought you meant you kept your oath. It can mean that too.

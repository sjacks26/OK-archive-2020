## Video is kind of rough. Ammon Bundy and someone else are on a platform in front of a podium. AB begins talking moments after the video starts.

AB: People have asked me about the dialogue between the agent, who was head of the power out here, between us and what went on. When we came to the fence, he was wanting to take control again, of how far we came up to the fence. We quickly made sure he understood he wasn’t in control anymore. This kept going on, he kept trying to control because that’s what he does and it’s who he is (0:00:47.2). Then a deputy sheriff came, and I could tell this man had the power of the people, he had the power there. The sheriff didn’t act in the way he should have, but he was there and still had that power. He immediately defused the situation. The sheriffs took over, and the BLM rolled out, the feds rolled out. Right?

## Crowd cheers

AB: That happened because of the people, we the people on both sides of the fence. We the people on one side of the fence protesting, saying we’re not having any more of this, and we the people on the other side of the fence, our sheriffs, saying we have the power out here and you guys get the hell out of here.

## Crowd cheers again

AB: (0:01:58.3) That’s what happened. I would have loved to be down in that camp when they said you guys have 45 minutes for 250 guys to leave. I’ve been down there the last several hours because I didn’t believe it would be right to leave one damn panel standing up.

## AB’s voice breaks as he says these last few words.

AB: So we took every damn panel and left it on the ground. (0:02:33.0) We found abused animals, we found dead animals. It made me sick. How could they do that? How could they take our animals and our property, abuse them and kill them? (0:02:57.4) At the gate, that was our federal government bearing their arms down on the people. It’s appalling, we should never stand for that and we have to make them accountable. We cannot stop. The battle has been won but the war is far from over. (0:03:16.0) Remember, we said this from the beginning. This is a war of agency. If we look into society or history, we see that man is not happy without agency. He becomes a subject of misery if he does not have his freedom. We find that there are men and forces that are always striving to take away the agency of man. If man does not fight for his freedom and agencies, they will be taken away (0:03:59.1). Today we fought for our free agency and we still have it!.

## Crowd cheers again. Video pans around. Several OK tab shirts and hats in the crowd.

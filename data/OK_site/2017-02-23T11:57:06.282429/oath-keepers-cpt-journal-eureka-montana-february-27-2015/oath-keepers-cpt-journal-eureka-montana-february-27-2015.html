<p>CPT Eureka has advanced quite spectacularly over the course of the past several months, with membership growing slowly but steadily, and team participants gaining considerable advanced knowledge in numerous fields, most noticeably in Emergency Medical and tactical methods. In the course of our development, I have observed certain timeline requirements that seem to naturally arise for organization to occur. Six months of weekly training has resulted in a solidification of the core team (the group of team members that participate on a regular basis and take on leadership roles). I don’t know if six months is a hard fast rule for organizing to take root, but it seems to be the minimum amount of time needed for members to get to know each other adequately and begin working together efficiently.</p>
<p>I want to stress this “time buffer” for training because all too often I see liberty activists claim that they will eventually start a CPT group, but continually put off organization on the assumption that everything will simply “come together quickly” when they are ready. It really doesn’t work that way. There are too many psychological and social barriers to work through before real training commences, and you will likely be forced to break down all of these barriers within the team over the course of many months. By barriers, I mean finding where people work best, what their strengths are, who is serious, who is not, and how to schedule your training time to create the best environment for progress.</p>
<p>This is the reason why it is ludicrous when certain activists in the Liberty Movement refuse to organize today and call for people to come together after a crisis scenario has occurred. Either out of fear or laziness, they have overlooked the issue of natural organizational tolerances. People do NOT work together all that easily, it’s just a fact of life. They need time to adapt to each other. CPT training is designed to give them the time and tools needed to make team organization happen, but the training must take place in a pre-crisis environment, otherwise, you’ll have a hell of a job getting anyone to cooperate with anyone.</p>
<p>The Eureka CPT now has its team leaders in all categories. Most importantly perhaps, we have separated out operation groups into what we call “Field Teams” and “Home Guard Teams”. Home Guard Teams are composed of those people who are limited in their level of tactical training by their physical conditions. This is what makes CPT different from any other training institution – we do not turn away those who are limited by age or disability, our goal is to train EVERYONE to the best that they are capable. Some people will never be tactically inclined, but we can still teach them to the point that they can defend themselves and others competently.</p>
<p>The Home Guard’s training methods focus more on defensive tactics from static locations, using well placed observation posts, asymmetric concepts, long distance shooting, and force multipliers. Needless to say, an old man or old woman can still be dangerous to a vicious aggressor if they are trained well in fighting from preplanned positions. We are lucky enough to have a Home Guard team leader with an extensive background in military base and perimeter security that has added immense additional knowledge to our library.</p>
<p>The Field Team is perhaps the most vital part of the tactical side of CPT. It is not “more important” than the Home Guard, but a large part of their job is to inspire all other members to push past their own perceived limits. Their mission is to bring the rest of the team up to a level they did not originally think possible. In my view, a solid Field Team makes for a solid CPT Team overall.</p>
<p>Our Field Team participates in extra training outside of regular meetings so that we can continue to learn within other categories. Do not let your field team become a separate entity from the rest of the CPT. This defeats the whole purpose of cross-training. Also, you want to avoid field team members developing the attitude that what they do is somehow more important than anything else, and that all other training should fall by the wayside.</p>
<p>The Eureka Field Team has covered team movement as well as various methods of asymmetrics, and is now going back to cover certain advanced fundamentals, including speed shooting drills, speed reloading drills, and speed transitions drills along with transition to pistol. The speed drills using a shot clock definitely add an element of stress to the training that is important. Training under stress helps to simulate the kind of adrenaline one might face during a real defense situation. The more one trains under stress, the more ready he/she will be when the real thing happens.</p>
<p>Over the course of the next month, all team members will be delving into long distance shooting and designated marksman fundamentals. I will be running a short presentation on the basics of long distance shooting including caliber choices, rifle choices, using a mil-dot rifle scope, range estimation, wind estimation, body alignment, shooting from elevation, etc. As the weather warms up we will run a long distance shooting workshop in which members will apply all the basics they learned and fire their rifle platforms at various ranges.</p>
<p>Soon, our team will be ready for the ultimate mission of Oath Keepers CPT, which is community outreach. Our goal is to present seminars and training events for the community at large, at the town, city, and county level. As I have stated in the past, CPT is not some secret squirrel prepping organization, it exists for the purpose of advancing and educating the general public. Our job is to help people help themselves, feed themselves, provide health care for themselves, and to defend themselves. This is what we do.</p>
<p>CPT members also need to carry themselves as quiet professionals, which is an art form sadly lost amongst many of the activist groups and various militias in the movement over the years. I have heard it argued once or twice that hey, we’ll “never be special forces, so why train with so much discipline? We’re just a bunch of regular Joes, right?” My response is that CPT should be training to the absolute HIGHEST standard possible, or what is the point? We should present a standard that is FAR ABOVE people’s expectations, not limit ourselves to an artificial psychological box. Every CPT member should come into training with the goal of surpassing their own perceived limitations, or frankly, they should stay home. That might sound harsh, but really, if we’re not willing to give 110% to mitigate a collapse of America and save lives, and if we fail our local communities, then in the end and by extension we will fail to defend liberty, and failure in such a fight is unacceptable.</p>
<p>This is Brandon Smith, Oath Keepers Associate Editor and member of the Eureka CPT, signing out.</p>

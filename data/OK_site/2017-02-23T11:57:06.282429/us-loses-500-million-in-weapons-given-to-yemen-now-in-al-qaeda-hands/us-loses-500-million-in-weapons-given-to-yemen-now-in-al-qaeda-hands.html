<p style="text-align: justify;">Once again, US meddling in other nations’ business has turned into a fiasco. History repeats, AND it rhymes. – Shorty Dawkins, Associate Editor</p>
<p><a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2015-03-23/us-loses-500-million-weapons-given-yemen-now-al-qaeda-hands" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2015-03-23/us-loses-500-million-weapons-given-yemen-now-al-qaeda-hands', 'This article comes from zerohedge.com');" target="_blank" title="Source article">This article comes from zerohedge.com</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Nobody could have possibly foreseen that yet another US foreign diplomacy “success story” would turn out to be an epic disaster. Well, nobody, except for those who accurately predict that every US intervention abroad is now a staggering fiasco (for everyone involved except the US military-industrial complex of course). As for Yemen, the outcome was clear long ago:</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">And, naturally, after noting that “the employees said that more than 20 vehicles were taken by the fighters after the Americans departed from Sanaa’s airport” we asked how long until we have a “tabulation of losses to US taxpayers, just like the great Islamic State ‘robbery’ of hundreds of millions in US military equipment in Iraq?” That, of course, was another epic US intervention success story.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Anyway, thanks to <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/pentagon-loses-sight-of-500-million-in-counterterrorism-aid-given-to-yemen/2015/03/17/f4ca25ce-cbf9-11e4-8a46-b1dc9be5a8ff_story.html" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/pentagon-loses-sight-of-500-million-in-counterterrorism-aid-given-to-yemen/2015/03/17/f4ca25ce-cbf9-11e4-8a46-b1dc9be5a8ff_story.html', 'WaPo we have an answer');" target="_blank">WaPo we have an answer</a>: according to Jeff Bezos’ recent media acquisition, “the Pentagon is unable to account for more than $500 million in U.S. military aid given to Yemen.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Obviously, “can’t account for” means “has lost.” But while the US does not know where nearly half a billion in weapons can be found, it is more than informed who is the current owner: there are “fears that the weaponry, aircraft and equipment is at risk of being seized by Iranian-backed rebels or al-Qaeda, according to U.S. officials.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And just like that, America’s now laughable, pathetic foreign policy has not only resulted in another US-supported administration to be exiled or worse, but is has directly armed the adversary. And to think it was only 6 months ago when the Teleprompter in Chief was praising the “Yemen success story.”<a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2014/09/10/statement-president-isil-1" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2014/09/10/statement-president-isil-1', ' From Obama’s Statement on ISIL as of September 10, 2014');" target="_blank"> From Obama’s Statement on ISIL as of September 10, 2014</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“Now, it will take time to eradicate a cancer like ISIL.  And any time we take military action, there are risks involved –- especially to the servicemen and women who carry out these missions.  But I want the American people to understand how this effort will be different from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.  It will not involve American combat troops fighting on foreign soil.  This counterterrorism campaign will be waged through a steady, relentless effort to take out ISIL wherever they exist, using our air power and our support for partner forces on the ground.  This strategy of taking out terrorists who threaten us, while supporting partners on the front lines, is one that we have successfully pursued in Yemen and Somalia for years.  And it is consistent with the approach I outlined earlier this year:  to use force against anyone who threatens America’s core interests, but to mobilize partners wherever possible to address broader challenges to international order.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Some may find it odd then, that 6 months later this “strategy” has been flipped on its head, and the Obama administration is taking out its partners (in Yemen), while supporting the terrorists who threaten us.</p>
<p>But almost everyone will say this was obvious from day one.</p>

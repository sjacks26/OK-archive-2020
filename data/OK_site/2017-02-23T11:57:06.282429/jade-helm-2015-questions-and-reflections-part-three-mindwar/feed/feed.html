<content:encoded>Finally, someone who seems to “get it.”  In reading about the history of Edward Bernays, I could not help but begin to question how much of our existence has been a construct of those that wish to manipulate and control the masses.  Prior to WWII, Bernays understood the art of propaganda as he wrote in his book “Propaganda,” but rather than seeing the potential abuse of what Bernays wrote about, people instead see him merely as the father of public relations.  It is entirely frightening seeing how much influence the methodology Bernays developed had on the American people prior to WWII and knowing that Goebbels prized Bernays’ “Propaganda” as a resource in his exploitation of the German people must make one realize how much our minds are being manipulated.  It is unfortunate that more people cannot see that the construct of our reality has been contrived for if they did we could overcome the triggers that have been created to divide us and rather come together in pursuit of overcoming our common enemy.  I, for one, have come to question the motives behind everything our politicians and media place in front of us.

<content:encoded>Absolutely gobsmackingly brilliant article!  
<p>For a good read on the type of technology actively being used upon American citizens as part of this MindWar, check out the recent book Chameleo by Robert Guffey (<a href="http://www.orbooks.com/catalog/chameleo/" rel="nofollow">http://www.orbooks.com/catalog/chameleo/</a>).  Also check out the concept of “gang stalking.”</p>
<p>In line with Elias’s insights here, might I also suggest the series of books by Seth and Jane Roberts regarding human consciousness.  These provide further extensive explanations as to the reality that underlies our physical existence.  Here is a quote from Seth explaining how our identity is inviolate, including when it comes to psyops:</p>
<p>	“Each identity possesses an integrity that will not allow any affiliation of which it does not approve.  Using an analogy, psychological antibodies are far more potent than physical ones.  The self or identity quite literally closes its boundaries to any forces that do not follow its own purposes and intents.  There are no exceptions<br/>
	This integrity allows the identity always to maintain its own patterns or mark, permitting within its peripheries only those affiliations that serve its unique purposes.  In those terms, the self or identity cannot be defiled.  Here I would like to add a brief side note having to do with cases of apparent “brainwashing,” in times of war, for example.<br/>
	You form your own reality.  Those captured in such encounters, therefore, are captured because they are already operating in a system of beliefs that does suit their greater purposes.  This subject is highly complicated.  Perhaps someday we can pursue it.  But in any case, the so-called brainwashing suits the purposes of those so treated.  This does not mean that no sympathy should be granted them.  A really close examination of their conscious beliefs and purposes, however, would show an acquiescence and acceptance of such experience, and a need for it to occur.”</p>

<content:encoded>Well my goodness!  I can tell by your email address that you are one serious-minded dude. For readers who can’t see your email address I’ll reprint it here:
<p><a href="mailto:nunya@suckit.fucku">nunya@suckit.fucku</a></p>
<p>What can that tell us about your judgment, your consciousness, your general mindset, your status as a spiritual being, your capacity for sentient cognizance, eh?  In my opinion, your email address is not only bogus but is also offensive and indicates your inability to be honest. Would you like to send me your real email address, or are you afraid to do that? Fearful? Distrustful? Overly cautious, lest your identity be forwarded to your CO? Your mind appears to be full of fear’s thought system, marked by a staunch denial and bullheaded adherence to your programming and conditioning. You’ll shoot at Americans in a heartbeat because you see them as “bs”, right? You’ll follow whatever order comes down the chain of command, right? Because you’re on the side of “the good guys”, right? Well, here’s a comment for you, Bubba —</p>
<p>I’ve provided you with ARSOF’s own announcement saying that JADE HELM 2015 is an UNCONVENTIONAL WARFARE exercise. I never said it was anything more than an exercise. What I’m talking about is what kind of exercise it is. Are you willing to deny that JH15 is an Unconventional Warfare exercise?</p>
<p>I’ve provided you with the US Army’s 2008 manual on Unconventional Warfare which states flat-out that PSYOP is a part of Unconventional Warfare. I’ve explained in detail that PSYOP targets the mind.</p>
<p>I’ve given you the whole document from the 7th Psychological Operations Group called “From PSYOP To MindWar” and shown in that document’s own wording that the people of the USA are included in the theater of MindWar, being targeted by military usage of the mass media for propaganda purposes. </p>
<p>Yet you somehow managed to ignore all of that and now accuse me of spouting “bs” as if I’ve said one word about JADE HELM 2015 being something other than an Unconventional Warfare training exercise. </p>
<p>Unlike many other “voices” on the Internet, I’ve never claimed that JH15 was anything other than an exercise. I do not hold any frenzied fear that it will “go live”, but I am keenly aware that “exercises” have generally accompanied peak false-flag events which have been used in MindWar to convince the American people that there is a terrorist behind every bush and outbuilding across America and that they must therefore submit to a total-control government-provided “security system” such as the coming martial law, which General Franks himself characterized as “a military form of government”.</p>
<p>One last question for you — all that “training” which is to be done under the name of JADE HELM 2015 — where is that training going to be sometime in the future deployed, eh? Are our soldiers now war-gaming to conquer the European Union?  Where is the “enemy”? Who is it? Can you think up one? Dude, the only “enemy” our government has in its sights right now is We The People who believe in the Constitution, unalienable rights, freedom, personal responsibility, and the right to own our lives individually out from under the “security” provided by a berserk government which has never been sued for failure to protect anybody. </p>
<p>The mindset under which you labor has been designed, orchestrated, choreographed, implanted, inserted, and reinforced with programming, training, and repetitive conditioning by a mechanism which commands your every action. You will some day grow out of that, perhaps, and when you do, you’ll hopefully not have the guilt on your shoulders for having done the wrong thing for what you had been trained to believe was the right thing. You will some day come to understand the wisdom carried in this line from a dead Viet Nam Veteran named Steve Mason —</p>
<p><strong><em>“Old soldiers with bad gums find out too late whom they really served.”</em></strong></p>
<p>But for now, please try to remember that there are some orders one should never obey, cannot obey without violating one’s Oath. If your Oath doesn’t mean anything to you, then you’ve got no soul and have violated your own lost honor by swearing to something you’ve no intention of honoring. So just do this for me — Remember when nut-cuttin’ time comes ’round — Do not fire on the American people. </p>
<p>Dude, you need to get a grip, and as soon as you do, you’re invited to come back here and answer my questions. If you can’t do that, you lose. 😉</p>
<p>Now run along and behave yourself.</p>
<p>Salute!<br/>
Elias Alias, editor — and — honorably-discharged U.S. Marine and Viet Nam Veteran who has most likely seen more combat than you’ll ever see in any modern deployment for which you’ve “trained”.</p>

<content:encoded>The pys-ops and the delusionary mindset is so strong, most don’t know right from wrong.   I want to encourage you all in that the darker it gets, the smallest light seems bright.   Get prepared.   Know your neighbors.   Be brave.   Be strong.   Be true.

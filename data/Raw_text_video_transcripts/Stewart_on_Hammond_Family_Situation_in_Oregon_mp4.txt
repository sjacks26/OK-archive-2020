Stewart Rhodes: [00:00:00] Know is what I've heard from talking to Ammon Bundy reading on his blog apparently what's going on things are scheduled to be sent back to prison. The judge originally sentenced them to a year, and they serve their time and the government appeal that decision. And the circuit court of appeals ruled that the judge had not sentenced them according to guidelines and so they mandated, I believe it's a five year sentence they have to complete. What I know is that the Hammonds at this time don't want anybody to try to stop that happening. So I think that's one of the main problems with people wanting to intervene is they don't want help. It's I don't think it's right for us to go in there and try to force them to accept our help. It's just like with Kim Davis without her protection against the U.S. marshals arrested treated for contempt of court. That would happen and she declined her help. I can't force myself on somebody. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:00:57] So that's one problem I see with this is that guys are upset about it. And I understand they don't like the BLM. I don't either. And you do have a lot of corruption and a lot of pressure on the people especially of rural America and we all know it's design. It's by design to depopulate the West. And so we do want to resist against it. But if someone doesn't want our help and wants to go to jail you can say well they're being coerced. Yeah. Potentially but if they don't want their family in the middle of an armed standoff I don't think it's right for us to go in there and try to force that on them. It's the wrong way to go. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:01:31] A big problem here is that they were convicted by a jury of peers. And told Hammond, if you could show me some proof that they did not get a fair trial. He said that he believed that the instructions to the jury from the judge were egregious. That said basically if you find that they set a fire at all you can get for a person you know without possibility of being a lawful burn. If that was the instructions then it got a real serious point. that this is not a fair trial. But I have yet to see the evidence. So that's what we need. Your major and most important for the court of public opinion. And if you're going to stand up against abuse. You'd better have your ducks in a row and be able to show that this was not a fair trial otherwise. Like the sheriff pointed out in this letter to the community, he had a trial and the jury found guilty for the peers and maybe it was wrong verdict and it makes it tougher for us to say we're going to stand up. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:02:32] The big problem for me is the fact that they don't want help. I just can't force myself on somebody. 

Unknown Speaker: [00:02:38] So there's no official call to action Right now. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:02:40] No there's not. And that's the big problem is they don't they don't they don't want it. You know it's a problem if they're being coerced they probably are. But I think the coercion was to stop talking to Ammon or we'll come get you early. But you're going to go to jail on July, January 1st which is the first week of January. And from all appearances they want to go because they just decided that's what they think is best for their family. And so you know I think we have to respect that. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:03:07] But look at the Bundy Ranch situation. Somebody else stepped in and said Well Mr. Bundy only wants X Y and Z, wants his cattle back. We want to go beyond that. We want to go with guns in hand, go and remove the BLM, you know destroy their offices would just burn the offices to the ground, and Mr. Bundy doesn't want I think to be overstepping just to defend the family. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:03:29] Here's another nothing. Bundy ranch was a clear situation where it looked like this family was about to be Waco'd. You know they brought in special forces veterans, they hired mercenaries, they brought in snipers. It was looking really bad. And we went in there saying we're here to prevent another Waco situation, that's what we're here to stop. I think that was very righteous. if you Don't have an imminent threat, That kind of situation, I think that also makes it tougher to justify armed intention. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:03:58] So I think it's like I talked about in my speech. we gotta look at the Founders example and they made sure that they retain the moral highground. And your most critical audience I told Ammon when I talked to them was critical audience in this country is the U.S. military, your brother veterans, your gun owners out there. These are the folks you want on your side, if there's going to be a fight you want them on your side. And so how you do it what you do matters and the credibility matters. And so even though we might think that with the government's position is totally illegitimate and it's worth standing up for what really counts is what your fellow American thinks. It's not the lefties in the big cities that count. That's the it's the military, it's the veterans and the people of the country. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:04:41] So you know we have to have credibility on our side. Credibility is the coin of the realm. But it's tough. No one wants to see people that don't deserve to go to prison go to prison. I go back to the ground zero. If they're not being Waco'd And if they don't want help. I don't think. If a family is being murdered I'm not going to ask for their help to help save their lives. But if you're not facing destruction like that and they don't want to help me, simply want to go serve her sentence. Who is who am I to tell them that's not going to happen. So I'm sure I'm gonna get flack for saying that. 

Unknown Speaker: [00:05:16] It's a free country right. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:05:17] If Someone does not want your help. Can't force yourself on like a shop owners down in Ferguson. I can't go on their roof without Their Permission. That would be a violation of their right to decide what they want to do. So if they consent and ask for our help, we'll be there. So that's w now unless I see something you know something else changes. You know

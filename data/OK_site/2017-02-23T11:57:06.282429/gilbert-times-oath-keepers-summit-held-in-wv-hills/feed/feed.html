<content:encoded>Message sent and comment left at newspaper story. Public relations is extremely critical. Note what the politicians and corporations do in their outreach to the masses. Their efforts are based on many decades of extensive research by some of the best-paid minds in all the USA. Your taxes have funded research, multiple billions of dollars worth, to determine the most effective way to influence people. You see the results everywhere; in advertising, what politicians begging for a vote spew relentlessly and elsewhere.
<p>Toss in the advice of folks such as Dale Carnegie with his well-known “How to Win Friends and Influence People” and emulate them. Let other’s efforts assist our efforts. One difference, though. While those others are not always dedicated to the truth; being more interested in grabbing your money, dedication, servitude, complacency and other self-serving to them aspects of life… Oath Keepers and other quality organizations care about PEOPLE. What is best for people in general. Not a select group with power and wealth always striving to amass more more more and to have immense power over others. Nope. Us non-elites care about more abstract concepts such as freedom and equitable opportunity to attain some basic economic security and to do so without economically raping other folks. This can be done without relying upon communism or fascism!!! Just remove some of the artificial barriers placed into the USA economy by the powerful elites (note; elite is a general broad-sweeping term of great complexity used to shorten posts).</p>
<p>Another 876,341,803 words would just begin to scrape the complexity of the topics I have brought here so I shall create thunderous applause in the audience by walking away from the podium and start eating the yummy vittles at the buffet table. Good night.</p>

<content:encoded>Yoda, with all due respect, I ask that you please watch that video through its entirety because your confusion of the all caps and hands and legs reference are their, the corporate, fictional, foreign agent’s words and definitions not Thomas David House of Deegan’s words.  The bottom line is the fact that the foreign agents purporting to be the lawful government in WV and each and every state in the union for that fact have breached their original contract (constitution) by leaps and bounds and each and every government agency or office is unlawfully incorporated.  These three (3) gentlemen from WV have filed petitions followed by a complaint calling these foreign agent’s out to where they can not answer this complaint which results in total default based on the Maxim of law “Silence is Acquiescence” making the petition and complaint true fact in law.  Please go to:  <a href="http://www.hudok.info" rel="nofollow">http://www.hudok.info</a>   and pull down the link on the right titled “legal filings and responses”.  Once you do so, you will see the viability of this action and how such action could snowball into the Holy Grail of righting our listing ship under the guise of true and natural law.  Please feel free to contact me at: <a href="mailto:wrmltd@pacbell.net">wrmltd@pacbell.net</a> if you have any questions.

<content:encoded>I’m sorry, my friend.  I listened to the first two minutes of that video and I had to turn it off.  You may have something here and I might agree and back you up but you just need to get to the bottom line and tell people what the issue is.  All caps and arms and legs.  What the hell!

<content:encoded>Was a great time for a lot of good reasons.<br/>
The professionalism was awesome.<br/>
The people were/are great, and everyone is looking for many of the answers found at this Summit by way of Oath Keepers.<br/>
The reality is that there are many incidents that shows a need for being ready.<br/>
C.P.T. – Community Preparedness Teams offer the ability to use the talents and abilities of local people to help anyone when any disaster or other problem needs addressed. That could be as terrible as getting the grass cut, setting up for an event, or survival after a storm.<br/>
Join us, you will not be disappointed.

<content:encoded>IMO, two of the most important attendees at this summit were West Virginia natives Phil Hudok and Gene Stalnaker. These two gentleman along with a brilliant gentleman named Thomas David House of Deegan from Mineral Wells, WV have lawfully put the three branch’s of their state’s purported government into total default and dishonor via their incredible case filed at the West Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals, Case No. 15-0491. Link to complaint here: <a href="http://hudok.info/files/7614/3" rel="nofollow">http://hudok.info/files/7614/3</a>… Some of you who attended this summit may have visited their vendor booth which contained the large Obama head blowing smoke. These two gentlemen, Gene and Phil attended this summit to solicit assistance from the local and national attendees including the militia personnel to enforce the rule of law in a real case of proven to be breach of their original contract perpetrated by these ‘corporate’, fictional, foreign agent’s who have been purporting to be lawful government of the state of West Virginia as opposed to the case of the Bundy ranch to where Mr. Bundy actually lost his Federal court case yet many from across the nation, including myself were present to assist against the tyrannical actions of those foreign agents who acted way beyond their scope of their purported authority. What has transpired in West Virginia via the lawful action these three gentlemen have taken should be a prime candidate for similar assistance that has been given to the Bundy ranch, Ferguson, military recruiting stations, and the gold mines. Folks, the whole state of West Virginia’s purported government is in total default and dishonor in law and their current offices are lawfully vacant with only their guns and thuggery holding down their positions.
<p>Go to: <a href="http://www.hudok.info" rel="nofollow">http://www.hudok.info</a> to obtain additional information into what many consider to be the Holy Grail of restoring the rule of law back from the foreign corporate takeover which commenced collectively and progressively since or possibly during the signing of the Declaration of Independence.</p>
<p>I respectfully ask that you all watch this edited from Live Stream to YouTube testimony pertaining to their case here: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULu5M9D2I-Y&amp;feature=youtu.be" rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULu5M9D2I-Y&amp;feature=youtu.be</a></p>

<content:encoded>Hey Thanks for taking that pic. Yes, that’s Joseph Rice in the picture at bottom of article. Did not have one of Mouse at the Sugar Pine Mine, but wanted to post a pic from that mine anyway. Thanks for clarifying that for all readers here.<br/>
Salute!<br/>

<content:encoded>Uh… that’s not Mouse in the bottom picture (which I took). I would have to get his permission to send you a pic that I have of him.
<p>For sure, he was a dedicated and inspiring addition to the Sugar Pine Mine operation.</p>

<content:encoded>Hi Steve, I am an Oath Keeper but I am unable to volunteer for guard duty; however,. I wanted to make a point for those that are. Stealth is the key here and open carrying ARs and handguns is not going over very well and making the news, at least in my area, it is scaring other business owners and bystanders, because they are not used to seeing guns in the open except on policemen. Also I think it makes them a bigger target. I would highly recommend (as you did) those who volunteer carry concealed and blend into the surroundings with an Oath Keepers emblem on them somewhere to easily ID them by pre coordinated local police.

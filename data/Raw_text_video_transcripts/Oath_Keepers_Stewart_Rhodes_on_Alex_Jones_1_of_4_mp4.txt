## Alex Jones; Stewart Rhodes

Alex Jones: [00:00:00] Join the rest the apology is going to come on like we sent out a police officer on. That's a perfect segue into that. 

Alex Jones: [00:00:05] He's Stewart Rhodes created a great Web site, constitutional lawyer. but masses of military police have been saying they pledged to be oath keepers and not violate the Bill of Rights, Constitution and follow their oath and it's, it's. When I read it I said this person has a deep knowledge of what's going on because this is how I would have written and probably better than I would have written it. So Stewart Rhodes thanks for coming on sir. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:00:28] Oh you're welcome. You're absolutely right. That was a fantastic segue. That officer is an Oath Keeper. and that's exactly what we are here to do, is bring more men like that out. And most of the members of our of our organization don't use their real names or we don't even want to know who they are because just like that gentleman just did. We want them to be able to continue with their job and continue doing the good work for the American people. 

Alex Jones: [00:00:54] Because the federal government is so out of control and criminal. I mean that's a sad testament to these officers don't really have their own First Amendment to say they don't respect the country being destroyed. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:01:05] That's right. And standing up and saying you might like to actually obey the Constitution can get you canned. So that's that's the world we live in right now. But you've been on our site. You can see the flood of the testimonials we had in from veterans most of the veterans are not afraid to put their name on it because you know they're no longer within reach of being punished for it and they're standing up and saying no we're not going to do this. And the veterans are very important because the veterans are there to teach the young bucks how to behave, to show them what they're supposed to be doing. And so that's our mission is to remind them of their oath, to teach them what it was a sworn oath to defend. And then to steel their resolve to do what's right. And that officer is correct. You've got to do that in advance. That's ahead of time so that when you draw your own lines in the sand and prepare yourself mentally to do what's right and then you'll do it. 

Alex Jones: [00:01:55] Absolutely just amazing testimonials on the site. what gave you the idea to create this and how many people have come on this site and pledge just a few weeks it's been up that they're going to stand by the Constitution, Bill of Rights. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:02:09] Well I was working for because Paul's campaign here in Nevada I used to work in his D.C. office and I was so focused on the campaign. but about a year and a half ago I had the idea that you know what do we do next. And if this campaign's not successful What's our next move. And my thought was this well let's hope our focus of effort be on the men with the guns. If you're going to have an awakening of one million people, you're going to have a chance to awaken one million people to be constitutionalists. wouldn't you want to focus on the military. And those are the men who were supposed to be our guardians. 

Alex Jones: [00:02:45] Exactly. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:02:47] They're the guardians of the republic. That's what they are. 

Alex Jones: [00:02:49] Yes. If tyranny's going to come it's going to come in the form of a uniform. The Ron Paul revolution probably woken up, even the mainstream media has, probably 20 30 million Americans identify. Now imagine if we focused on the police and military game over for the New World Order go ahead. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:03:04] Exactly precisely. It's like maneuver warfare theory, you go to the rear of the enemy, you go to the heart of their strength. It's kind of like in a lot of the Rings how the ring of power. They think the Ring of Power is what these guys are going to do whatever they say. They think the oath is there a ring of power but it's not true. The oath is to the constitution and even more fundamentally is to the people. And so we're going to take that to Mount Doom and toss it, You know right up there shoot. 

Alex Jones: [00:03:28] Oh man that analogy is just pure gold. You are something special. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:03:34] Let me tell you something I write for SWAT magazine and here's what I think got me thinking about this, is about a year and a half ago I wrote a column and in response to that column we got a letter from a U.S. Jr. Yuel, Colonel U.S. Army retired. And he said the Constitution and our Bill of Rights are gravely endangered today and this community of military, veterans, and law enforcement is where they will be saved, if they are to be saved at all. And he had the same insight you did have. Look if they can't do it without those guys. Game over. if you like the end of the movie V for Vendetta. But you know the military stands down and there's nothing between the people and the vultures. Nothing. And that's what our goal is. 

Alex Jones: [00:04:14] Well the police are going to lose their houses they already are they're going to lose their future in this new world order. It's going to lose this second amendment. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:04:21] And their children will be indentured servants for the rest of their lives. That's right. 

Alex Jones: [00:04:27] Yeah the globalist have overplayed their hand. I keep telling listeners, the phony churches on government payroll, I told you this a decade ago. Now it's de-classified, are telling you to stand down. So there's several rings of power. One is the police and the enforcers. The other is is the churches, got to take those back. Stay there sir. Tell folks how they can visit the Oath Keepers Web site. When we come back. 

Alex Jones: [00:04:53] A ragtag band. Declaring. Independence. They laid their bodies down in a bloody war. For liberty for their descendants. Look in the mirror. That's you. That's me. Thanks to the renegades were free today. Thanks to the Renegades. We're free today. Free. Thank God for the renegades and the lives they lead. Far ahead of their Time. Without the Renegades the Lord knows where we'd be. 

Alex Jones: [00:05:45] When it comes to heroes. Renegades are mine and we're going back to the Mordor analogy, you have the tower, the mount of power with the all seeing eye with its armies moving across the world but right here in its command base right here in Empire U.S. It is distracted looking looking everywhere for the ring. That's what this MIAC report is is they're counting on the police and military men or Urakai or orcs or black ships from the east there. They're planning on them going along with this evil and being seduced by the dark side, by being played and manipulated and maneuvered into a war with the American people as they destroy their own futures as they burn their own beds, their own nest. It's going to fail. It is going to fail you have to first believe that and know that and reach out to the police and military now so they understand and educate them. Waking up one police officer, one active duty military person, is like waking up a thousand regular Americans. Now we have to also understand that the key here is is there's people like Stewart Rhodes there with. Other dash keepers not blogspot dot com oath dash keepers dot blogspot dot com or just google his name Stewart Rhodes Oath Keepers and it'll come up for you. Now up on screen right now. 

Alex Jones: [00:07:07] Prisonplanet.TV. the fact that there is Ron Paul and Alex Jones and Stewart Rhodes and Jesse Ventura and thousands of other prominent people fighting not just millions waking up and fighting. They kill me and only makes my information grow that much faster. If I was the only guy doing this thought I'd be dead. if Stewart was the only guy doing they go set him up or something. But there's too many of us now. They can't target and intimidate. They had the Ron Paul girl in here last night, I didn't know that she was on my show last time they were waiting for outside, Amy Allen with crowbars stealing nothing has put her in a hospital room breaking bones. That is the type of intimidation, I've been physically attacked and they've told me shut up or you're dead. Next time I fought back and fought them off and they didn't like getting hurt, I got hurt bad too, but they were you know they were surprised that I wasn't a sheep and I actually went absolutely ape. I'm not a slave. You attack me I attacked right back. By at time enjoyed it you know. I mean that's just how I am That's live in there. You know you don't really live until four people are pounding on you, but sad for her she's a little girl. Hurt her bad. She came out that scary. You've got to see all that means I'm hurting you. That means I'm getting close to the crack of doom. to Dump this ring in. You have to dare great ladies and gentlemen and you can see I'm gonna shut up. I made those points. It's just that they're also trying to divide our movements trying to demonize trying to say, don't trust this leader, don't get that leader. That's the operatives, that's what COINTELPRO does. This person's a mason, that you know that person's a Vatican assassin, this person works for Israel. It's the information that's key. Bill of Rights, Constitution, liberty, Second Amendment, national sovereignty. Cut the size of government, kick them out of the states. You know a tree by its fruits. So the other attack is to divide us. Now go ahead and comment On those points Stewart Rhodes and let's get into the Oath Keepers. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:08:53] Definitely right. And that's why. Oath Keepers and that's we've always stressed that this was this was this was first contemplated and first planned before the election. We didn't care who got elected, didn't make a difference who was going to be president. We saw the growth of executive power. and we're talking about active duty military and veterans and these gentlemen don't care who was president. We're looking at the big picture and we're also we stay neutral on politics, we stay neutral on the Iraq war. In fact I'll be I'll be speaking roughly speaking at a big event in June, a big pro-troops rally in June and I was invited by former Navy SEAL Captain Larry Bailey of Gathering of Eagles. So one of the more hard core conservative groups who listened during Bush are starting to wake up and understand what the what the great danger is. And so we're seeing an awakening like this officer said, the steady quickening. And it doesn't make a difference. Forget about left and right and forget about that kind of stuff like you've said before. It's about liberty or tyranny. That's the only that's the dividing line. And so we go back to the basics, we go back to the Declaration of Independence. We go back to the Bill of Rights. we did back the Constitution. Those are our all our common bond. Absolutely. All right that's all we care about. And you swore an oath to defend the Constitution and you swore an oath was fundamentally to defend the people of this country and that's all we care about. That's what really matters. 

Alex Jones: [00:10:15] And their interests and their interest is with the American people too. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:10:19] Of course you know what they end up along the Mordor on the Potomac. They belong to us. They're our fathers, our sons, our sisters, our uncles. they are us they don't belong to them. They belong to us. We're taking it back. 

Alex Jones: [00:10:33] That's right. They don't belong to Mordor do they. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:10:35] No we don't know where we're taking them back. 

Alex Jones: [00:10:38] They belong to midas tirith

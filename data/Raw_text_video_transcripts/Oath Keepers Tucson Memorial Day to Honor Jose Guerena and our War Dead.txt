Title screen: Memorial Day 2011 Hundreds gathered in Tucson, Arizona to Honor U.S.M.C. Veteran Jose Guerena and our War Dead.

Video shows a march, led by an OK banner, with several American flags, an AZ flag, a USMC flag, at least two Gadsden flags. The march goes by Guerena’s house.

SR: (0:04:50.4) We’re here on Memorial Day for a very good reason. Memorial Day to remember our war dead. Today, we’re here to remember a fallen Marine, a fallen brother. However we served, we’re all brothers, we all swore the same oath. We are not here to criticize, condemn, or persecute the individual deputies on the Pima County Sheriff’s Department. My uncle served 25 years as a Pima County Deputy Sheriff. It’s about our Constitution, our rights. It’s about what it means to be an American. Whatever our background, whoever we are, we all share some important things in common: our Declaration of Independence, which talks about timeless, inalienable rights, self-evident truths of liberty; and our Constitution, which guarantees us all security, especially in our homes, papers, and effects from unreasonable searches. I can’t imagine a more unreasonable search than one that ends in your death. That’s why we’re here. This policy puts at risk not just police officers, but also veterans, retired police officers, any American who is well-trained is going to react the same way. The better trained you are, the more likely you are to respond like Jose Guerena, get your weapon, move towards the threat, step between your family and what you think is a home invasion. It can happen to any of us. We reserve most of our criticism of that policy for this afternoon when we go to the Arizona Hotel at 1pm. We’ll have a series of speakers who will go into detail about why this is a flawed policy, why it must be changed. (0:06:47.3) Of all the 12k of my membership in OK, we asked them all, all of them said the same thing: they’d do the same thing. That’s the problem with this policy.

SR: What better way to honor our fallen war heroes than to stand up and defend the Constitution and our way of life, which they gave their lives to defend. No higher way to honor them. We’re going to have Marine Sergeant Lily Gonzalez, and her husband Capt. Burl Bolton, they’re going to step up and read part of the Declaration of Independence. (0:07:33.2)

LG: We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal. That they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights. That among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. That to secure these rights, governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed. That, whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the right of the people to alter or abolish it, and to institute new government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form as to them shall seem most likely to effect their safety and happiness. 

BB: Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security. (0:09:01.1)

SR: Today, we want to be the start of a reform, a correction of the militarization of our police, and the flawed policy of using SWAT to serve simple search warrants, that puts two good guys against each other in a dark hallway, where they can’t tell who’s the good guy and who’s the bad guy. Now I’d like to have Rex McTyeire, U.S. Army Special Force retired, he was a major, he’s going to read 1A.

RM: (0:09:37.9) Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.

SR: Next we’ll have Gunnery Sgt. Alan Doyle, USMC from North Carolina, reading 2A.

AD: (0:10:06.8) A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.

SR: Next John Oetken from Orange County OK will read 3A.

JO: (0:10:28.5) No Soldier shall, in time of peace be quartered in any house, without the consent of the Owner, nor in time of war, but in a manner to be prescribed by law.

SR: Now we’ll have Jose Chaira, cousin of Jose. His wife Maria is going to read in his place.

MC: (0:10:54.6) The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.

SR: Now we’ll have Brian Miller, a current serving Air Force A-10 combat experienced pilot. He’ll read 5A:

BM: No person shall be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise infamous crime, unless on a presentment or indictment of a Grand Jury, except in cases arising in the land or naval forces, or in the Militia, when in actual service in time of War or public danger; nor shall any person be subject for the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb; nor shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself, nor be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation.

SR: Now we’ll have Tony Martinez, founder of Sons of Liberty Riders, will read 6A.

TM: (0:12:19.7) In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial, by an impartial jury of the State and district wherein the crime shall have been committed, which district shall have been previously ascertained by law, and to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation; to be confronted with the witnesses against him; to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor, and to have the Assistance of Counsel for his defence.

SR: Next is Wendy Shops, AZ chapter president of Sons of Liberty Riders, reading 7A.

WS: (0:12:54.9) In Suits at common law, where the value in controversy shall exceed twenty dollars, the right of trial by jury shall be preserved, and no fact tried by a jury, shall be otherwise re-examined in any Court of the United States, than according to the rules of the common law.

SR: Next we’ll have Gerald Rhodes, AZ Vice President, oh I’m sorry, Ray Epps, AZ chapter president, will read 8A.

RE: Excessive bail shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted.

SR: Ray is a retired Marine Corps Sgt. Next is Gerald Rhodes, VP of AZ chapter of OK, reading 9A.

GR: (0:13:49.0) The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people.

SR: Next is Phillip Torrez, citizen of AZ, reading 10A

PT: The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.

SR: Marine General Smedley Butler, a man who won 2 Medals of Honor, after all he went through, said there are only 2 things worth fighting for: our homes and the Bill of Rights. That’s why we’re here today. That’s the only things worth fighting for, and that’s all we have. Without freedom, there is no America. Now Sheriff Mack is going to say a few words. 

RMa: (0:14:56.8) Vanessa, could you come here? As a former sheriff of AZ, I want to offer you our most sincere apologies.
## RMa’s voice breaks as he says this.
RMa: For what happened to you and your family. This should not have happened anywhere in America, it shouldn’t have happened in AZ. Everyone that was responsible for this owes you and your two small children an apology. [In Spanish:] And I would like to say to all Jose Guerenas relatives that live in Arizona or in Mexico, we are so very sorry. Jose should be here with us right now. And this wasn’t just a mistake, it was a genuine sin. And we are so sorry and we love you. We offer you our heart and our heart is bleeding, just as yours is. And we offer you our affection. (0:16:12.9) [In English:] Thank you for being here.

RMa: Having spent 20 years in law enforcement, 8 in AZ. Please let’s look at what we’re doing. This did not need to happen, tactically speaking. This did not need to happen. This could have been handled more easily. I guess we saw that this was not a major affair when these guys found what was in that home. Nothing illegal. Even if it was, we have to change our policies and our tactics. SWAT teams all across this country are overused, and are used on calls they shouldn’t be used on. Let’s start getting real. Let’s look at ourselves, what we’re doing. It’s high time, nationwide, not just in AZ, we have to readdress what’s going on with our SWAT team usage and our SWAT policies. For gods sake, isn’t this time we all woke up? Just like the Gettysburg Address says, Abraham Lincoln said, it is rather for us, the living, to be dedicated to these principles that some have given their all for. Like Jose Guerena. Let’s be real. Let’s make sure he didn’t die in vain. (0:17:53.7)

SR: All of us, who swore an oath? How many did? We are all to blame. We’ve been negligent in our responsibilities, whether we’re military, police, fire fighters, whatever our service was. It’s up to us to defend the Constitution. That’s what our oath is for. That does not expire until you do. I encourage all of you to do as Sheriff Mack just said. Make sure his death was not in vain. Make sure this is a start of reclaiming our Bill of Rights, reclaiming our Constitution. Assuring to our posterity freedom. You cannot be free if the agents of the state can come in your door at any time and put machine guns in the face of your family. That’s not right. It’s up to all of us. As Sheriff Mack said in the video we made about this, law enforcement in this country owns part of the problem, but not all of it. The judges and the lawyers and the politicians are part of the problem too. It’s the responsibility of all of us to correct this. Now I’m going to have Capt. Gregory Gooch, U.S. Navy, Merchant Marine, he’s going to present our plaque to the family. (0:19:08.8)

GG: On behalf of OK, I’d like to read this plaque, then I’ll present it to Vanessa. In memory of Jose Manuel Guerena, expressing our condolences, honoring his service to the country, and to his family, OK pledge in his name to prevent this from happening to others, bringing thereby much gain for America in his sacrifice. Semper Fidelis. Oath Keepers. May 30, 2011.

## A woman hands Vanessa a shirt and a proclamation from OK saying they stand behind the Guerenas, cards too. Presents for her sons too.

RMa: Whereas on the 5th of May, 2011, in the United States of America, in the sovereign state of Arizona in the city of Tucson, Marine Veteran Jose Guerena was shot dead in his home by constitutionally arming himself as he was trained to do, to protect himself and his family from masked men busting down his front door. And, whereas the Pima County Sheriff’s Department, under the control of Sheriff Dupnik, dispatched the Pima County SWAT team to execute a search warrant upon the residence of Marine Veteran Jose Guerena. And whereas, waking from a dead sleep, Jose Guerena attempted to answer the yelling at his front door within the allotted 20 seconds or the door comes down. Jose Guerena, with his rifle at his side, was ready to defend his home against unknown masked persons who showed themselves to his wife as they ran past a window. The SWAT team entered and shot the Marine veteran 61 times. Whereas, it is the policy of the Pima County Sheriff’s SWAT team to execute search warrants in this manner, where the homeowner or person residing therein is known to be constitutionally in possession of legal firearms. Be it known, this incident is in clear violation of the Bill of Rights. Amendments 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 8, to the Constitution of the United States of America, where every citizen has the inalienable right to keep and bear arms to protect himself against government tyranny or a criminal threat to his person, home, or family. Be it further known, the Oath Keepers of, all Oath Keepers of the United States and internationally, are supporting this special memorial ceremony in honor of United States Marine Veteran Jose Guerena, who died at the hands of sworn police officers who violated their oath to protect and defend the Constitution of the United States of America, by not protecting and defending a constitutionally armed citizen of the United States of America. Be it resolved that the Oath Keepers of America do hereby stand united against constitutionally-illegal government, in that all United States citizens are presumed innocent until proven guilty in a court of law, and that the sheriffs of all counties be urged to not use the force of SWAT in search warrants on people with no criminal or violent records, or other constitutionally armed citizens, unless there are sufficient judicial probable cause to believe that the lives of United States citizens are in jeopardy. Be it further resolved that we the below signed, urge every deputy sheriff, probation officer, bailiff, highway patrolman, court officer, and every other person who has taken an oath of office to protect and defend the Constitution of the United States, to read and study the Constitution and the Federalist Papers, the primary source of the Supreme Court constitutional information, particularly papers 28, 29, and 46, that preceded the writing of the Constitution so that they might never themselves be in the position of taking up arms or legislating laws against the very peoples we have sworn to protect and defend. Signed this 30th day of May in the year of our Lord 2011.

SR: (0:24:28.9) Now we are going to have a moment of silence, followed by the playing of Taps.

SR: (0:26:39.4) Now we want to close with a prayer.

JS: I’m James Sillepie. I’m going to recite the Universal Prayer. It takes 3 minutes, have this be a precious moment. Lord, we believe in you, increase our faith. We trust in you, strengthen our trust. We love you, let us love you more and more. We are sorry for our sins, deepen our sorrow. We worship you as our first beginning, we long for you as our last end, we praise you as our constant help and call on you as our loving protector. Guide us by Your wisdom, correct us with Your justice, comfort us with Your mercy, protect us with Your power. We offer You, Lord, our thoughts; to be fixed on You; our words: to have You for their theme; our actions: to reflect our love for You; our sufferings: to be joined with yours for the forgiveness of sin. We want to do what You ask of us: in the way You ask, for as long as you ask, because You ask. Keep us, Lord, attentive at prayer, temperate in food and drink, diligent in our work, firm in our good intentions. Let our conscience be clear, our conduct without fault, our speech blameless, our life well-ordered. Let us cherish Your love for us, keep Your law, and come at last to Your salvation. Teach us to realize that this world is passing, that our true future is happiness of heaven, that life on earth is short, and the life to come eternal. Help us to prepare for death with a proper fear of judgment, but a greater trust in Your goodness. Lead us safely through death to the endless joy of heaven. Grant this though our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ. Amen.

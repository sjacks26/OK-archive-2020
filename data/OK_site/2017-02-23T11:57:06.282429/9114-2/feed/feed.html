<content:encoded>Only a government of idiots, run by idiots and corrupt minds, signs documents, laws, regulations, contracts, agreements, without reading them. Yes, this is the reason the government machine is broken. There is no reason why any thing should have 2k + pages and if that is the case, then there should be a rule in place: for each 2 pages of laws and regulations congress must vote on, a day is required, prior to voting, so everyone has the time to read, ponder and emit an opinion that is credible. Now, 2k+ pages that would make for about 3 years since day of submission to day of voting. I bet the dishonest crooks and idiots that draft these behemoth documents would find a way to slim them down pretty quick! A purge of good sense would do, to make these bills lose weight! Also, anyone signing a document/law without reading it should be fired and judged for treason against America.

<content:encoded>Voting on something one has not read is totally insane and for sure means,  They are stupid or bribed.  The vote was 316-113 Paul and his father before him seem to be the only outspoken senators with any brains

<content:encoded>In 2012 had we voted in all Democrats, this same budget would have just passed.  We got no bang for our buck in 2012 and there is no point in repeating this and again voting Republican.  I believe that if Rand Paul were to be elected president, he would meet the same fate as did John F. Kennedy in 1963.  At this point, the only thing conservatives can do is stock up on beans and bullet, get as far form the cities as possible, and wait for the other shoe to fall.

<content:encoded>Not only are they required to read the bill, they are required to write it/them. 
<p>Article I, Section 1 says that “All legislative Powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States, which shall consist of a Senate and House of Representatives.”</p>
<p>It does NOT say that “All legislative Powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States, which shall consist of a Senate and House of Representatives, their assistants of whatever degree, and whatever agencies, etc of any branch or foreign entity, foreign government, etc that they wish to give these powers to.”</p>
<p>Those elected that serve within the Senate and House of Representatives are allowed to use those powers assigned to those positions and the branch.  Those powers/authority does not belong to the people who serve to give away, trade, etc.  Those that serve within the Senate and the House of Representatives are ALLOWED to use those powers for as long as they continue to meet the requirements of taking and KEEPING the Oath, and the list of duties assigned to the branch and named positions. They are allowed to have assistants to assist in their duties such as do research, make appointments, bring coffee, make copies, etc, but NOT to do those duties for those elected representatives.</p>
<p>Remember the framers knew that each word has meaning, and they put into words exactly what they meant.  </p>
<p>The idea of those that serve within our governments within the different branches that was foremost in their minds was accountability to the people.  To give the powers assigned to the named legislative positions to some unnamed agency that had no accountability to the people would have been a disaster in their minds (as we can see today as this is exactly what we have, though unlawfully).  One looks at things a bit differently regarding power, authority once one is actually “in the fire” and does not want that type of tyranny to go forward for their posterity to have to face.  They did not put their lives, fortunes, property, etc on the line for unnamed agencies or people with no or little accountability to have the authority of our government behind them.</p>
<p>This is not binding on the American people bcause we did NOT delegate such actions to those who are there to represent us.  The$1.1 trillion government spending bill that was passed unread is not lawful and they must use their OWN funds to spend in all areas mentioned within that bill.  That is not what they were placed into government for (okay, it is by those seeking to destroy the USA, but for as long as they are still pretending to be our representatives it is NOT).  </p>
<p>This action on their part is “Misappropriation of Funds” which is the intentional, illegal use of the property or funds of another person for one’s own use or other unauthorized purpose, particularly by a public official…, which is a felony, a crime against the American people.  Remember, it is our funds they are spending so wildly. </p>
<p>The members of Congress – except for those that voted against it – can be, and should be, held personally responsible for that Breach of Trust, which is basically the abuse of power, or failure – and it matters not if the action(s) was not intentional, or if they were through dishonesty, or if purely negligent; but that they acted in violation of the duties of the terms of a trust listed within the US Constitution for the positions they occupy.</p>
<p>James Madison: “I cannot undertake to lay my finger upon an article of the Constitution which granted a right to Congress of expending, on the objects of benevolence, the money of their constituents.”</p>
<p>Thomas Jefferson: “It would be a dangerous delusion were a confidence in the men of our choice to silence our fears for the safety of our rights; that confidence is everywhere the parent of despotism; free government is founded in jealousy, and not in confidence; it is jealousy, and not confidence, which prescribes limited constitutions to bind down those whom we are obliged to trust with power; that our Constitution has accordingly fixed the limits to which, and no farther, our confidence may go…. In questions of power, let no more be said of confidence in man, but bind him down from mischief by the chains of the Constitution.”</p>
<p>Thomas Jefferson to Wilson Nicholas: “Our peculiar security is in the possession of a written Constitution. Let us not make it a blank paper by construction.”</p>
<p>James Madison: “Do not separate text from historical background. If you do, you will have perverted and subverted the Constitution, which can only end in a distorted, bastardized form of illegitimate government.”</p>
<p>George Washington, Farewell Address: “It is important, likewise, that the habits of thinking in a free Country should inspire caution in those entrusted with its administration, to confine themselves within their respective Constitutional spheres; avoiding in the exercise of the Powers of one department to encroach upon another. The spirit of encroachment tends to consolidate the powers of all the departments in one, and thus to create whatever the form of government, a real despotism. The necessity of reciprocal checks in the exercise of political power; by dividing and distributing it into different depositories, and constituting each the Guardian of the Public Weal against invasions by the others, has been evinced by experiments ancient and modern; some of them in our country and under our own eyes. To preserve them must be as necessary as to institute them.”</p>
<p>Alexander Hamilton: “Every act of a delegated authority, contrary to the tenor of the commission under which it is exercised, is void. No legislative act, therefore, contrary to the Constitution, can be valid. To deny this, would be to affirm, that the deputy is greater than his principal; that the servant is above his master; that the representatives of the people are superior to the people themselves; that men acting by virtue of powers, may do not only what their powers do not authorize, but what they forbid.”</p>
<p>Things to think about</p>
<p>If you believe that SWAT teams, etc are lawful here in America, read this.</p>
<p>Justice Joseph Story: “This provision speaks for itself. Its plain object is to secure the perfect enjoyment of that great right of the common law, that a man’s house shall be his own castle, privileged against all civil and military intrusion.” </p>
<p>KEEP YOUR OATH!</p>
<p>John Adams (“On Government,” 1778): “The use of checks and balances in the forms of government, is to create delays and multiply diversities of interests, by which the tendency on a sudden to violate them may be counteracted.” </p>
<p>U.S. Supreme Court Justice James Wilson (Lectures): “Liberty and security in government depend not on the limits, which the rulers may please to assign to the exercise of their own powers, but on the boundaries, within which their powers are circumscribed by the constitution. With us, the powers of magistrates, call them by whatever name you please, are the grants of the people . . . The supreme power is in them; and in them, even when a constitution is formed, and government is in operation, the supreme power still remains. A portion of their authority they, indeed, delegate; but they delegate that portion in whatever manner, in whatever measure, for whatever time, to whatever persons, and on whatever conditions they choose to fix.”</p>

<content:encoded>I am sure congress won’t read my comment, but hats off to you Senator Paul. I think it should be required that all voters on a bill must read and digest it. If they want to make it 2500 pages long so be it, but after they say they have read it there should be a quiz to see if it was read and was understood.After this it should be passed on to the public, no back room deals. Just another idea if we ever get this country back on track again.

<content:encoded>I have the utmost respect for peace officers..We have a great peace officer team in our area<br/>
but then most are already Oath Keepers not Oath Breakers..<br/>
My Husband was a over the road trucker when Oath breaking cops came in and held automatic rifles to my 4 children’s heads and mine for no reason..Jack booted thugs they are and if you think using Military tactics against unarmed civilians or armed peaceful civilians is okay your wrong..You are right u need to be all suited up..Just don’t forget we own them too!..We finally got a cop for first degree murder murdering a little boy and we won’t stop until all cops who murder Americans are behind bars where they all belong!..Little boys, Girls, Men, Women, Children, Peace Officers = Law abiding American Citizens ..You Violated many people’s lives and rights by being Militarized..Most of Our Military wouldn’t do what you do..Oh and of course what happened to me and my children was also in Missouri just call it Misery ..These Kind of Cops Hate ..They are taught to Hate and use that badge to get away with being criminals!!!…Mad you bet i’am mad..My children can’t even sleep without a light on and someone else in the room because they are afraid of COPS!!!..People they should be looking up too …You made your bed lie in it!…Oath Breaker! If Americans don’t respect you, you need to do some real soul searching and ask yourself, why? ..Growing up all the police were nice friendly they knew all the kids and the kids respected them..My Uncle was Chief of Police for 35 years and never treated a American Citizen the way some cops are today..I say some as there are still many who would throw down that badge rather then break there Oath to the Constitution..I think you need to dust off your Constitution and bill of rights!<br/>
Your destroying Our Nation and we are taking it back..One Oath Keeper at a time..Honesty

<content:encoded>Well, Dr. Vieira has some insight, and the comments about federally-militarized police and Ferguson are instructive. All that said, Dr. Vieira has shown us has to shift the game from forceful and even political, to a regular self-interested carrot and stick that no one would be able to stop. It is worth 44 minutes of your time (though you may have to watch it half a dozen times), and to get your state-level legislators to be pro-active. The point-of-sale technology can be used for this now, too. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHKD4wSpE78" rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHKD4wSpE78</a>

<content:encoded>“Without the gear we wear and tear gas and other so-called Military equipment, there would be a lot of injured Officers.”
<p>Yet Oathkeepers kept business and apartments within the immediate area of attack under control and safe and they nor others were injured – go take some lessons from them?</p>
<p>The police there (Ferguson) did not do so well with PROTECTING the people from those that the government brought in to Ferguson carrying already-prepared-ahead-of-time signs made by the communist party (logo/words on them), and the LE’s, it was officially admitted, were told to “stand down”, to basically commit treason and terrorism by breaking the Oath and allowing those people who lived there to die.  Understand that those in charge of the state and the city of Ferguson knew ahead of time that “provocateurs” were being brought in to “escalate things there.  You LE’s are a useful tool and they care not if you are injured or die.</p>
<p>“…  not violate your rights.”</p>
<p>Any warrantless anything here in America goes against our legitimate laws and the US Constitution.  I hope that you are a lawful officer, but I admit I doubt it as you stood down when ordered to by domestic enemies of the USA instead of arresting them.</p>
<p>Sorry, You took the Oath, knew your duty, or SHOULD KNOW, is to the US Constitution above and BEFORE the orders of ANY person – federal or state, and what your job entails.  Those same people you take orders from were/are willing to sacrifice you “Boys in Blue (Black now)” to make a political statement and to destroy our nation from within.</p>
<p>Start thinking.  </p>
<p>Make a correct choice and stand by your nation, KEEP your Oath, OR at least make a decision to willingly and knowingly become a traitor to the USA, the American people – but make it YOUR decision, not those willing to sacrifice you, your “comrades in arms”.  Because here in America it is no defense that you were “just doing your job” or “just following orders”, one can still get the death penalty for treason for “just doing your job” or “just following orders” (backed up by the Nuremberg Trials, Nazi Germany – they were hung there for “just doing your job” or “just following orders”).</p>
<p>If you are not sure what is required of you by the Oath – and it IS a Felony to NOT take or keep it – ask cspoa.org or oathkeepers. They can assist you in undoing the “progressive” brainwashing you have gone through that was necessary in order to use the LE’s against their own nation, their own people, their own LEGITIMATE government – and it is NOT those that serve within it that is “the government”. </p>
<p>Like you, they are employees – elected, hired, contracted, volunteer, etc.  Like you they are under the US Constitution first, then whatever state Constitution (if it applies) THEN the contract of the immediate position that they may have created.  But always first is the US Constitution – supporting and defending it.</p>
<p>As one commenter on another site said: “Police who say they can’t do their jobs without violating the constitution are saying they can’t do their jobs (because that is a requirement of the job).” </p>
<p>There is NEVER any excuse or reason here in the USA to ever declare “martial law” or “emergency powers” as they are actually an open declaration of treason by the person who does it no matter what position they occupy within the governments – state or general (federal).  It is the exact opposite of the US Constitution (as much of what is done by those who serve within governmental positions today is also).</p>
<p>Remember this when or IF one is given the order to impose “martial law” (or martial law tactics) or “emergency powers” on and against the American people then ARREST the person, and the people that person took orders from for *TREASON and **Terrorism against the American people.</p>
<p>Home Building &amp; Loan Association v. Blaisdell, 290 U.S. 398, 425 (1934): “Emergency does not create power. Emergency does not increase granted power or remove or diminish the restrictions upon power granted or reserved. The Constitution was adopted in a period of grave emergency. Its grants of power to the Federal Government and its limitations of the power of the States were determined in the light of emergency and they are not altered by emergency.”</p>
<p>The Supreme Court of the United States: “The Constitution of the United States is a law for rulers and people, equally in war and peace, and covers with the shield of its protection all classes of men, at all times, and under all circumstances. No doctrine involving more pernicious consequences was ever invented by the wit of man than that any of its provisions can be suspended during any of the great exigencies of government. Such a doctrine leads directly to anarchy or despotism.”</p>
<p>Treason is always against the American people here, and ALWAYS throughout history those taking governmental orders have been USED against their people.  Do NOT do the same.  YOU who are/were under governmental orders whatever position you occupy/occupied are an American, get to know intimately your US Constitution which REQUIRES of you to support and defend it.</p>
<p>Silveira v. Lockyer, 328 F.3d 567 (2003), Judge Alex Kozinski of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reminded us that the Second Amendment is not about duck hunting: “All too many of the other great tragedies of history – Stalin’s atrocities, the killing fields of Cambodia, the Holocaust, to name but a few – were perpetrated by armed troops against unarmed populations. Many could well have been avoided or mitigated, had the perpetrators known their intended victims were equipped with a rifle and twenty bullets apiece, as the Militia Act required here. … If a few hundred Jewish fighters in the Warsaw Ghetto could hold off the Wehrmacht for almost a month with only a handful of weapons, six million Jews armed with rifles could not so easily have been herded into cattle cars.<br/>
“My excellent colleagues have forgotten these bitter lessons of history. The prospect of tyranny may not grab the headlines the way vivid stories of gun crime routinely do. But few saw the Third Reich coming until it was too late. The Second Amendment is a doomsday provision, one designed for those exceptionally rare circumstances where all other rights have failed – where the government refuses to stand for re-election and silences those who protest; where courts have lost the courage to oppose, or can find no one to enforce their decrees. However improbable these contingencies may seem today, facing them unprepared is a mistake a free people get to make only once.<br/>
“Fortunately, the Framers were wise enough to entrench the right of the people to keep and bear arms within our constitutional structure. The purpose and importance of that right was still fresh in their minds, and they spelled it out clearly so it would not be forgotten.”  (end quote by Judge Alex Kozinski)</p>
<p>The People vs. Herkimer, 15 American Decisions 379, 4 Cowen NY 345, 348 (1825): “The people, or the Sovereign are not bound by general words in statutes, restrictive of prerogative rights, titles or interests, unless expressly named. Acts of limitation do not bind at the King, nor the people. The people have been ceded all the rights of the king, the former Sovereign. It is a maxim of the common-law that when an act of parliament is made for the public good, the advancement of religion and Justice, and to prevent injury and wrong, the king shall be bound by such an act, though not named; but when a statute is General, and any prerogative rights, titles or interests would be divested or taken from the king (or the people) in such case he shall not be bound”.</p>
<p>* Treason – <a href="http://www.shastadefense.com/Dare-Call-It-Treason-21.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.shastadefense.com/Dare-Call-It-Treason-21.pdf</a></p>
<p>** Terrorism – 28 C.F.R. Section 0.85 Terrorism is defined as “the unlawful use of force and violence against persons or property to intimidate or coerce a government, the civilian population, or any segment thereof, in furtherance of political or social objectives”. </p>
<p>Ronald Reagan: “I had a copy of the Soviet Constitution and I read it with great interest. And I saw all kinds of terms in there that sound just exactly like our own: ‘Freedom of assembly’ and ‘freedom of speech’ and so forth. Of course, they don’t allow them to have those things, but they’re in there in the constitution.<br/>
But I began to wonder about the other constitutions – everyone has one – and our own, and why so much emphasis on ours.<br/>
And then I found out, and the answer was very simple – that’s why you don’t notice it at first. But it is so great that it tells the entire difference. All those other constitutions are documents that say, ‘We, the government, allow the people the following rights,’ and our Constitution says ‘We the People, allow the government the following privileges and rights.’ We give our permission to government to do the things that it does. And that’s the whole story of the difference – why we’re unique in the world and why no matter what our troubles may be, we’re going to overcome”.  (End Regan quote)</p>
<p>“Times are changing and certain people have no respect for the Police, Government or you and your family”</p>
<p>You get respect when you can do the position you occupy LAWFULLY as required here in THIS nation – we are NOT Germany, Russia, China, etc yet those are the tactics LE’s use.</p>

<content:encoded>Well, Buzz, you are seeing the situation through the eyes of a police officer and that is completely understandable.  I don’t know anyone who would argue that, during extraordinary times, extreme measures are not necessary.  However, when a baby dies in a crib from a flashbang or a dynamic entry is done on the wrong house and the family is terrorized, or worse, something is very wrong.  Hard tactics are over used and those who screw up rarely pay a price.  See the video of the guy in Arizona who was being arrested for unlawful camping.  After a flashbang went off two feet away from him, he couldn’t hear the commands to drop his knife and get on the ground.  He was shot dead for mental illness and vagrancy.  Ironically, it is the far left who continually vote for authoritarian government and then gripe about the cops who are sent to enforce liberal laws.  See dead guy selling “loosey” cigarettes in Staten Island.

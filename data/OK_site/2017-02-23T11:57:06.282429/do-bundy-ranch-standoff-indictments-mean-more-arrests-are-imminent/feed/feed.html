<content:encoded>Agreed up to the point of garrilla warfare.  When people talk like that I have to point out all the elderly and infirmed that will be the collateral damage.   When people  get scares they stay home. And who looks after those in hospitals and old folks homes ect.  
<p>A real protest March by able bodied  and ready to fight will get attention.  Targeted to specific places of threat.  With real expectations.  And identity concealed(  lile wearing sunglasses).  There is no reason anyone should make themselves a target.</p>
<p>If several thousand show up a few times  consistently. Attention will be had.  If not then all is lost already.</p>

<content:encoded>Actually Dana, I was only pointing out that the NAZI form was a derivative of the original version. Fact is, we can look at many leaders in the early 20th century and ferret out tenets of Fascism. Woodrow Wilson would be a great place to start. We could even go back further to the Reconstruction period and look at say, the Sedition Act, or Confiscation Act as structural footholds for Fascism. Point is, the text books have it right and your insistence of wanting a different historical outcome does not make it so…..

<content:encoded>Robert D…Thank you!…Notice that this has garnered absolutely no comments/interest, except for your excellent reply.  Instead, the typical response to this article is either *we gotta do something* or *time to lock and load* or time for *millions to head to Washington*, and blah, blah, blah. Nothing but the typical *hot-head* response to a situation and lacking any analytical/critical thinking.
<p>Instead of something like this national rally, we got involved in the Bundy Ranch fiasco, the Ferguson fiasco, the Malheur fiasco.  This is not to demean those Patriots who supported or took a physical stand.</p>
<p>I am just so sick and tired of *In-the-Box* thinking/tactics by those who portend to be *leaders*</p>

<content:encoded>It shouldn’t surprise anyone that Cliven Bundy was arrested. Yes the government did back down in 2014. But they also regrouped.Because that’s what they do. They put their lawyers to work building a case against those that stood up.For the US government time, money and lawyers are in unlimited supply.When they want you look out.

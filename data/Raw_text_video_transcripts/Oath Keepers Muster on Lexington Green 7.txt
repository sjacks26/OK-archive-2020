RM: Get this. From local or municipal authorities form distinct and independent portions of the supremacy. The federal government thinks they’re supreme. They read the supremacy clause wrong. It’s proved in this book. They’re wrong. The supremacy clause doesn’t say the federal government’s supreme, it says the Constitution is supreme. That’s a huge difference. (0:00:35.5) This separation, I’m quoting Scalia and James Madison all over again, this separation of the two spheres is one of the Constitution’s structural protections of liberty. The separation of the two spheres of state and local governments between the feds. The 10A is what we won this case on. 10A basically tells the federal government this: if we forgot anything, you can’t do that either. Again, quoting from the US SC, you can tell why I wrote this book: hence a double security arises to the rights of the people. The different governments will control each other at the same time that each will be controlled by itself. Isn’t that amazing. So who can we depend on when the federal government refuses to control itself? State and local authorities. How about those who promised in god’s name to uphold and defend obey and preserve the US Constitution. Do you think we should depend on them for protection? I think so. (0:01:58.6) Real briefly, what does a constitutional sheriff look like? I have to tell you an incident that occurred to a hero of mine. In 1959, she was arrested because she wouldn’t get to the back of the bus. Her name was Rosa Parks. I always wanted to shake her hand before she died, I didn’t get that opportunity. But I honor her today, because she stood against stupid laws. (0:02:34.2) When the bus driver stopped the bus and called the sheriff on the payphone, a deputy came and arrested Rosa Parks, took her to the Sheriff’s Office, finger printed her, took her picture, and put her in jail. She was bailed out soon afterwards, but anyway she went to jail, not because of a tradition but because of a law that even at that time was justified by our US SC. They were all wrong. The SC has been wrong lots of times. On mine, they were right. We support them on that. But this time on Rosa Parks they were wrong. But what would a constitutional sheriff do when that call came in? The sheriff would hear the call himself and say deputy, I’m gonna take this call. Because he wants to set the proper example for all his deputies. So he goes and meets the bus driver over there on Elm Street, wherever it was in Montgomery, Alabama. And he says Mrs. Parks, what’s the problem here. And she says I’m not giving up my seat, I can sit here, I have the right to sit here. And he goes, Mrs. Parks, you’re right, and he shakes her hand. And he says do you mind if I sit next to you? And he says where are you getting off? And she says down here another couple of stops on Elm Street. He says do you mind if I accompany you as you get off the bus to make sure you do so safely? Make sure nobody’s throwing rocks. And on the way home, would you like to stop by the all-white restaurant and get a few burgers for you and your husband? (0:04:15.7)

RM: And he makes sure that he does and that she’s safe. And he takes her home and makes sure she’s safe. And why? He’s violating the law? No! He violated a statute to uphold the law. The supreme law of the land. And a constitutional sheriff who keeps his oath of office, who is a real and true Oath Keeper, does exactly that. Then he goes to her hand and shakes hands with Mr. Parks and says we’re gonna give you extra patrol tonight, because your wife took a stand and there might be some people mad at her. And he asks Mr. Parks, is your shotgun loaded? Make sure it is. And make sure you call us if you need extra manpower.

RM: What does the constitutional officer do today? (0:05:17.9) He protects Rosa Parks the gun owner. He protects Rosa Parks the victim of the IRS. He protects Rosa Parks the tax protestor. He protects and defends Rosa parks the medical marijuana person. And he protects people who simply want to be left alone. And he knows and understands that. What do we have in this country’s recent history, when sheriffs abdicate their authority to the federal government? We have Randy Weaver with his wife and son who are dead, because those bullets came from federal snipers. And we have people at Waco who are burned alive. If the sheriffs had remained in charge in both of those locations, we never would have heard of David Koresh or Randy Weaver, and the law still would have been enforced and obeyed.

RM: (0:06:21.8) When I was a rooky cop, I made a huge mistake. I read the Constitution. I looked at the Constitution on this hand, and I looked at government and what we were doing on this hand. And there was no resemblance. I promised myself I would never be on the wrong side again. And I won’t. That promise, 10 years later, came alive when Bill Clinton signed the Brady Bill into law and I filed a lawsuit 3 months later to stop it. It’s all on states’ rights. 

RM: (0:07:05.6) I went to a police training called Constitutional Studies for Law Enforcement. I hope some of you know who the instructor was, he died about 2 years ago, he was a mentor, a man I honor very much. His name was W. Cleon Skousen. As a peace officer, I went to this with 240 other police officers, and he taught me something there. I’d like to leave it with you today as America’s political prayer. You can tell that this is from my heart, and I send it to you heart. I believe without any question that this is America’s political prayer. It goes like this. We the People of the United States, in order to form a more perfect Union, establish justice, ensure domestic tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and to our posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the USA. That’s the eagle. Long may she be free.

## RM is on the verge of crying as he says the preamble. He accompanies that recital with hand gestures. They seem significant to him, but I couldn’t discern any meaning in them.

SR: (0:09:00.7) Now that’s a sheriff. If you join us afterwards, I’m gonna have him tell you his testimonial about how he first had his epiphany as a young deputy.

<p>As if the fearmongery and vitriol of UK, Europe and the US were not   enough, the Middle-East’s ‘allied’ leaders are now opining on the threat   of ISIS. <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/world/2014/08/30/saudi-king-warns-isis-terror-threat-to-europe-us/" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.foxnews.com/world/2014/08/30/saudi-king-warns-isis-terror-threat-to-europe-us/', 'As FOX News reports');">As FOX News reports</a>,   The king of Saudi Arabia has warned that jihadists could target the   United States and Europe if leaders across the globe do not react to   growing terrorist threats as Islamic State militants make advances   across Iraq and Syria. <strong>“If neglected, I am certain that after a   month they will reach Europe and, after another month, America,”  blasted  King Abdullah, adding Cameron-esquely, “they know no humanity.”</strong> Of course, this is quote ironic given the Saudi’s funding of various terror groups throughout theregion.</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>The king of Saudi Arabia has warned that jihadists could   target the United States and Europe if leaders across the globe do not   react to growing terrorist threats as Islamic State militants make   advances across Iraq and Syria.</strong></p>
<p>While not mentioning any terrorist groups by name, King Abdullah’s   statement appeared aimed at drawing Washington and NATO forces into a   wider fight against the Islamic State terror organization and its   supporters in the region. Saudi Arabia openly backs rebels fighting   Syrian President Bashar Assad, but is concerned that the breakaway Al   Qaeda group could also turn those very same weapons on the kingdom.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>“If neglected, I am   certain that after a month they will reach Europe and, after another   month, America,” he said at a reception for foreign ambassadors Friday.</strong></span></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">“These terrorists   do not know the name of humanity and you have witnessed them severing   heads and giving them to children to walk with in the street,” </span></strong>the king said, urging the ambassadors to relay his message directly to their heads of state.</p>
<p>The Islamic State, formerly known as ISIS, has been fighting moderate   rebels, other extremists and Assad’s forces in Syria for nearly three   years. Iraq has faced an onslaught by the Sunni extremists and their   supporters since early this year, and the country continues to be roiled   by instability.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>While providing   arms and support to Sunni militants in Syria, Saudi Arabia has denied   directly funding or backing the Islamic State group.</strong></span></p>
<p>…</p>
<p><strong>Saudi Arabia, a major U.S. ally in the region, has taken an increasingly active role in criticizing the Islamic State group.</strong> Earlier this month, the country’s top cleric described the Islamic   State group and Al Qaeda as Islam’s No. 1 enemy and said that Muslims   have been their first victims. State-backed Saudi clerics who once   openly called on citizens to fight in Syria can now face steep   punishment and the kingdom has threatened to imprison its citizens who   fight in Syria and Iraq.</p>
<p><strong>A decade ago, Al Qaeda militants launched a string of attacks in the kingdom aimed at toppling the monarchy.</strong> Saudi officials responded with a massive crackdown that saw many flee   to neighboring Yemen. In the time since, the kingdom has not seen any   massive attacks, though it has imprisoned suspected militants and   sentenced others to death.</p></blockquote>
<p>*  *  *</p>
<p>The question is – is this an explicit call for US to protect them   more… or else… or just more posturing to stir the populist vote for   more war…?</p>
<p><strong>ASSOCIATE EDITOR’S NOTE:  I suppose the Saudi government would know all  about the ISIS timeline, since they have been helping covert agencies  to fund and arm Sunni extremist groups from the very beginning…</strong></p>

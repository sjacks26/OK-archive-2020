<p>Prepping is not just about storing supplies. It is about being as self-sufficient as possible. What skills do you have? Are you in a place to utilize those skills? – Shorty Dawkins, Associate editor.</p>

<p>Did you ever think about what your life would be like if the stores were closed? I’m not talking about a post-apocalyptic Mad Max scenario or a winter storm that clears the shelves. I’m talking about a long-term disruption of services caused by <a href="http://www.theorganicprepper.ca/preppernomics-how-to-survive-while-the-dollar-dies-01012015" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.theorganicprepper.ca/preppernomics-how-to-survive-while-the-dollar-dies-01012015', 'an economic collapse');" target="_blank" title="preppernomics">an economic collapse</a>.</p>
<p>What if you couldn’t run to Wal-Mart to get soap?  What if the grocery store had supplies so limited that they were rationed out to people in such small amounts that the food you got was not enough to meet your needs? What if there were no diapers for your baby or aspirin to cure a headache?</p>
<p>This is exactly what happens in a serious economic collapse. It happened a couple of years ago in Greece, and it’s happening right now in Venezuela. <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2015-01-09/venezuelans-throng-grocery-stores-on-military-protection-order.html" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2015-01-09/venezuelans-throng-grocery-stores-on-military-protection-order.html', 'Bloomberg.com reports a scene of desperation');" target="_blank" title="Bloomberg">Bloomberg.com reports a scene of desperation</a>:</p>
<p>Long lines, some stretching for blocks, formed outside grocery stores in the South American country’s capital as residents search for scarce basic items such as detergent and chicken.</p>
<p>“I’ve visited six stores already today looking for detergent — I can’t find it anywhere,” said Lisbeth Elsa, a 27-year-old janitor, waiting in line outside a supermarket in eastern Caracas. “We’re wearing our dirty clothes again because we can’t find it. At this point I’ll buy whatever I can find.”</p>
<p>Inside a Plan Suarez grocery store yesterday in eastern Caracas, shelves were mostly bare. Customers struggled and fought for items at times, with many trying to skip lines. The most sought-after products included detergent, with customers waiting in line for two to three hours to buy a maximum of two bags. A security guard asked that photos of empty shelves not be taken.</p>
<p>Police inside a Luvebras supermarket in eastern Caracas intervened to help staff distribute toilet paper and other products.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“You can’t find anything, I’ve spent 15 days looking for diapers,” Jean Paul Mate, a meat vendor, said outside the Luvebras store. “You have to take off work to look for products. I go to at least five stores a day.”</p>
<p>“This is the worst it has ever been — I’ve seen lines thousands of people long,” Greisly Jarpe, a 42-year-old data analyst, said as she waited for dish soap in eastern Caracas. “People are so desperate they’re sleeping in the lines.”<br/>

<content:encoded>This is an important article in comparative law (USA – Canada) from 1990, long before the 10th Amendment Center became active with “Nullification”.

<p>The Locus of Sovereignty: Judicial Review, Legislative Supremacy, and Federalism in the Constitutional Traditions of Canada and the United States<br/>
Calvin R. Massey<br/>
Duke Law Journal<br/>
Vol. 1990, No. 6 (Dec., 1990), pp. 1229-1310<br/>
Published by: Duke University School of Law<br/>
Article Stable URL: <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/1372833" rel="nofollow">http://www.jstor.org/stable/1372833</a></p>
<p>The article discusses and in my proves that the concept of nullification was a POLITICAL TACTIC, and not a statement of viable constitutional LAW.</p>
<p>I urge you to consider the reality. Those who are attacking America and Canada, and who are actually merging us right now, need to politically dismantle both of our countries — and Mexico (about which I know nothing) — in order to complete the Communist regional union.</p>
<p>The biggest gift that Canada or American could hand to these people — who have planned this overthrow for a century and thought every aspect out in advance, including the reactions of our citizens, in particular of our respective patriots — is to help them out by encouraging or allowing any or all of our States or any or all of our Provinces to declare UDI, i.e., claim “sovereignty”, and thus disintegrate and dismantle our nations FOR them.</p>
<p>This would dispose of our lawful Constitutions. It would leave federal military ordnance including any ultra-secret military technology (such as that which was apparently used on 9/11) into the hands of the usurpers.  We would be disarming America and Canada and dismantling our nations for them!</p>
<p>They would then (ultra high risk) send in “UN” troops from the re-emerging USSR, from China, from Red nations to the South, etc., etc., to pull off a Red Dawn scenario.</p>
<p>The common-sense route is to think out carefully what the incipient coup needs to to and plans to do, and DO NOT COOPERATE by handing it to them on a platter. Whatever it is apparent that they want, plan carefully and meticulously and do the opposite!  </p>
<p>If they want to disintegrate and dismantle, you put the wagons in a circle and hold the fort as one United America, not a disarrayed series of fragments.  Ditto for Canada.</p>
<p>The United Nations is not a “peace keeping” organization. It is a weapon of constitutional warfare which for many decades has targeted Canada for dismantling.</p>
<p>For example, and I’m giving this to you quickly, because I haven’t finished my research:  the so-called “separatist” PARTI QUEBECOIS (PQ) — caps to avoid French accents — was not in fact founded by RENE LEVESQUE.</p>
<p>A “secret committee” of Communists who had penetrated the federal government of Canada, while sitting on the Montreal business premises of Power Corporation of Canada in 1967, determined that a party should be set up in Quebec which they in the federal level could then be seen to “fight” in a referendum over the invented issue of “federal-ISM” -vs- “separat-ISM”.   The existence of the secret committee is documented in a book by a “former” Marxist-Leninist, who himself is involved in the overthrow of Canada. Therefore, it requires careful reading:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Eye-Eagle-Jean-Lisee/dp/0006376363/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1426484568&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=in+the+eye+of+the+eagle%2C+lisee" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.co.uk/Eye-Eagle-Jean-Lisee/dp/0006376363/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1426484568&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=in+the+eye+of+the+eagle%2C+lisee</a></p>
<p>Secret Committee chapter is scanned here:</p>
<p><a href="http://en.calameo.com/books/000747447d8d4b4a9f7f2" rel="nofollow">http://en.calameo.com/books/000747447d8d4b4a9f7f2</a></p>
<p>(LISEE moreover refers to American diplomatic notes he supposedly unearthed through access to information.)</p>
<p>Men on that secret committee included:</p>
<p>1) Pierre Elliott Trudeau (who, according to Alan Stang; also documented elsewhere), led a Communist delegation at Moscow in 1952 while this millionaire was an employee in his first paid junior job in Canada’s Privy Council Office.</p>
<p>2) Jean Marchand – a leftist who helped to infiltrate respectable trade unions to turn them left;</p>
<p>3) Maurice SAUVE – an apparently nondescript forestry minister who turns out to be very possibly the lynchpin of the PQ infiltration.  SAUVE was the first President of the World Assembly of Youth (WAY), which is now documented in many sources available online to have been set up and funded as a covert operation of British Secret Intelligence Services (SIS) better known as MI6, and the American CIA.</p>
<p>There is information online, including videos by G. Edward Griffin for the Western Goals Foundation, which confirms that General Donovan deliberately staffed the CIA with Communists.  He went knocking on Communist doors to get them.</p>
<p>MI6 as well as MI5 were infiltrated with Soviet agents at the time WAY was created; including the infamous Kim Philby.  In addition, Soviet defector to Canada, Igor Gouzenko, speaking to journalist Peter Worthington, asserted and affirmed that Roger Hollis, Director General of MI5, was also a Soviet agent. Hollis was active at the same time.</p>
<p>The World Assembly of Youth was set up as a supposed “anti-communist” front to oppose another youth front that had “become” Soviet-controlled. That’s the story line.  The man in UK who saw to available British funding for WAY was Chancellor of the Exchequer Stafford Cripps, a Fabian socialist and pro-Soviet who advocated for Communism…. and who supposedly did not know and had to be “convinced” that the other youth front had become Soviet-controlled, before he would supply funding for WAY.  Cripps’s appointment by Churchill was said to be evidence of Britain’s “full bolchevization”.</p>
<p>WAY was thus set up and funded by MI6 and CIA, both of which agencies were Soviet-penetrated.</p>
<p>WAY proceeded to lead the FEDERALIZATION movement among youth in Europe. In other words, regionalization, which is now happening in North America. WAY was therefore a covert intelligence operation set up and funded by Cripps, MI6 and CIA to FEDERALIZE (de-nationalize) European youth.</p>
<p>Maurice SAUVE, the first President of WAY, was married to Jeanne Benoit SAUVE, who worked for UNESCO.  Jeanne Benoit took a role in WAY with respect to WAY’s “Canadian” committee.</p>
<p>Today, at the “SAUVE SCHOLARS” web site of the now-deceased pair (Maurice and Jeanne) is the admission that they both took party in WAY, in the “founding” of WAY, and that:</p>
<p>“… in 1949, with her husband, Maurice Sauvé, she became actively involved in the founding of the World Assembly of Youth (WAY), an international youth congress that was being established as an adjunct to the newly-minted United Nations…”</p>
<p>Source:  <a href="http://www.sauvescholars.org/en/about_us/jeanne_sauve_foundation" rel="nofollow">http://www.sauvescholars.org/en/about_us/jeanne_sauve_foundation</a></p>
<p>See that?  AN ADJUNCT TO THE NEWLY MINTED UNITED NATIONS.</p>
<p>In other words, WAY was set up and funded as a supposed “anti-communist” front by Cripps, MI6 and CIA. Various sources allege that those behind WAY “hoped” it would also “counter” the federalist movement in Europe.</p>
<p>In fact, WAY advanced the federalist movement in Europe and was active in many venues to that end.</p>
<p>WAY was in effect a covert intelligence operation set up as an “ADJUNCT TO THE UNITED NATIONS” with a genuine view, in spite of denials, to federalizing Europe.</p>
<p>This is the UNITED NATIONS attacking the sovereign nations of Europe to denationalize them!</p>
<p>Now, back to the secret committee.  And fast-forward. In 1967, the secret committee with former WAY President Maurice SAUVE on it (and his wife Jeanne of UNESCO fame in the wings), determines that a “party” must be set up to “fight” Quebec “separatism” (actually COMMUNISM from FLQ Castro-trained terrorists; and Marxism inculcated into the local trade unions and certain working class neighborhoods) by conducting a “vote” (referendum) in Communist-controlled Quebec alone, in which two FORMS of FUTURE GOVERNMENT FOR ALL OF CANADA would be “debated” on a “clear question”.  The two forms would be “federal-ISM” and “separat-ISM”, thus putting the lawful Constitution of 1867 completely to the side, and suspending it!  The debate was moreover a lose-lose situation, as the “federal-ISM” being pitted against the false flag of “separat-ISM” was in fact EUROPEAN FEDERALISM, the new Marxist regional union unfolding as the European Economic Community (EEC).  Separat-ISM was a false flag because its object — which I see clearly according to all my research the past eleven years — was to use a UDI in Quebec (under veiled Communist and Fascist control, the Left and the Super-capitalists collaborating) to forcibly dismantle Canada if the “rest of Canada” refused to “negotiate” its own dismantling (go along quietly, please!) after a Yes in Quebec.  The “federal-ISM” aimed at by the pro-Soviet Trudeau “option” was, as I said, nothing other than EUROPEAN federal-ISM advocated by Maurice and Jeanne Benoit SAUVE in their activities with UNESCO and WAY.</p>
<p>Before I forget, it is vital to keep clear in mind that the secret committee which held meetings every Friday night in Montreal on Power Corporation premises, was a committee of FEDERAL MINISTERS FROM QUEBEC in the CABINET of LESTER BOWLES PEARSON.  This was the FEDERAL de facto government of Canada on Big Business corporate premises, contriving a way for THEMSELVES to be able to impose the European regional system on Canada, by setting up a fake political party in Quebec disguised as ethnic “separatists”, whom the FEDERAL LEVEL would then allow to hold a referendum that is unlawful and unconstitutional in this country (I will explain that another day).  </p>
<p>Lester Bowles Pearson, aka “Mike”, was a Soviet agent.  Alan Stang was unfairly chastized in The Edmund Burke Society’s hand-typed anti-communist review of May 1971 for Stang’s having accused Pearson of being a Communist.  Stang was right!  Elizabeth Bentley, a Soviet GRU defecting back to America, had exposed Pearson during the McCarran hearings:</p>
<p><a href="http://en.calameo.com/books/0001117902fdc6e3ba9ff" rel="nofollow">http://en.calameo.com/books/0001117902fdc6e3ba9ff</a></p>
<p>Therefore, the 1967 secret committee which included about a dozen people, most not named by the book’s author, being largely pro-Communist, Communist, pro-Soviet FEDERAL ministers in the Cabinet of Soviet agent Lester Pearson.</p>
<p>1) Therefore, less than 20 years after WAY was set up as a supposedly “anti-communist” front with the help of Maurice and Jeanne Benoit SAUVE, we find Maurice SAUVE on a secret committee setting up a COMMUNIST political party to dismantle Canada. The fact the PQ is Communist (if not Communist-Fascist) is apparent from the 1972 political manifesto published and discussed in French only, which I discovered a little over a year ago on a law-library shelf, and have been translating.</p>
<p>(2) The PQ party which these people ordained be set up, itself became the SOURCE of a new WAY-like organization run by the local and North American left, the “North American Forum on Integration” (NAFI), which in French was called the “Forum sur l’INTEGRATION Nord-AMERICAINE” (FINA) — caps to avoid French accents.  Oathkeepers undoubtedly saw the NAFI-FINA web site when it was online; it’s gone now, but I have a half-gig backup of most of it.</p>
<p>NAFI proceeded to launch a “North American parliament” IN THE CANADIAN SENATE CHAMBER in 2005, thus confirming the FEDERAL control over this Communist activity emerging from Quebec.</p>
<p>NAFI proceeded to run annual “model” regional parliaments and YOUTH forums to advance North American federal-ISM, by encouraging our youth to adopt a “North American identity”.  But this is precisely what World Assembly of Youth (WAY) was doing in Europe. And WAY still exists. They have a web site.</p>
<p>If WAY is known to have been set up and funded by pro-Soviet Cripps, Soviet-infiltrated MI6 and the Communist-staffed CIA, then the NAFI which emerged from a fake party (the PQ) which was set up at the instance of a committee of Communists including the first President of WAY (and necessarily his wife Jeanne Benoit in the rear-guard) under a Soviet agent prime minister, to carry out exactly the same agenda as WAY had done in Europe… must logically, itself, also be some kind of “adjunct” to the not-so-newly minted United Nations, which is dismantling our countries to transfer our national and state sovereignty to regional institutions and to the UN itself, as the front of an incoming world government.</p>
<p>Further evidence suggests that the CIA-State Department-Treasury-White House (please take no offense, you know what I mean) were involved in the first Quebec referendum in 1980.</p>
<p>An “Outlook Report” produced by the above league of institutions under President Jimmy Carter (a Rockefeller Trilateral man) in August of 1977 spells out a number of “scenarios” for the ‘outcome’ of a referendum in Quebec.</p>
<p>The Outlook Report chooses a “preferred” scenario: and it lays out the ideal referendum question and a two-part structure for the unfolding of the Quebec scenario, which the Report deems most likely to result in Canada’s federal level being able to “negotiate” with Quebec.</p>
<p>What are they going to “negotiate”?  They are going to negotiate REGIONALISM, for all of Canada, which is clearly the top half of the North American region to match the European region, under an incoming world government.</p>
<p>The referendum question and scenario used by Communist RENE LEVESQUE in 1980 are identical to the question and scenario “preferred” in the August 1977 Outlook Report of the CIA-White House-State Department-Treasury.</p>
<p>That suggests to me that the same international intelligence organizations — infiltrated by Communists at the time WAY was set up, continued to operate in the case of Canada through the “secret committee” of Power Corporation of Canada, and that these international intelligence units are indeed undoubtedly still infested and continuing to push the referendum agenda here in Canada.</p>
<p>The stark fact is that America now has a “separat-IST” movement of its own!  What excellent timing. Obviously, something has to be done to dismantle America in order to complete the FTA, NAFTA, and the SPP and post-9/11 merger long underway… when Quebec is forced to another fake “vote”.  Is it not a bit too convenient that a group exposed in the L.A. Times as LEFTISTS, is advocating for “sovereignty” for the American States, while dressing it all up in what the scholar first linked above identified as merely “political rhetoric” having nothing to do with constitutional LAW?  Is it not too convenient that a “separat-ist” (secessionist) movement has developed in recent years in America, in tandem with the intelligence-controlled “separat-ist” operation in Quebec and Canada?</p>
<p>It is deadly to take this lightly. Rationally, logically speaking, it cannot be a coincidence.</p>
<p>DO NOT DO what your leftist “separat-ists” want!  They are not working for America, they are as veiled in USA as the Communist PQ is veiled up here. Take nothing for granted!  Do not give it to them!  They have you Americans in EVERY State working toward your so-called “sovereignty”, the way the PQ and their network up here has French Canadians in Quebec working toward THEIRS!</p>
<p>The PARTI QUEBECOIS is Communist — and it was set up by some of the same people who set up the WAY less than 20 years earlier as an “adjunct” to the United Nations.  It is the UN which is attacking our nations!  It is the Communist UN which is attacking our nations through its agents infiltrated into our governments.</p>
<p>Moreover, PIERRE-MARC JOHNSON, who succeeded Communist RENE-LEVESQUE as leader of the veiled Communist PQ, signed the CFR-Big Business (Communist-Fascist) blueprint to merge North America after 9/11:</p>
<p>Building A North American Community (known as the North American Union):</p>
<p><a href="http://www.cfr.org/canada/building-north-american-community/p8102" rel="nofollow">http://www.cfr.org/canada/building-north-american-community/p8102</a></p>
<p>But, Communist RENE LEVESQUE always called his new system for all of Canada:</p>
<p>The Canadian Community, and The Canadian Union.</p>
<p>Don’t let them dismantle America for “sovereignty”. Don’t do it for them.</p>
<p>The United Nations is not a peace instrument. It is a Soviet weapon of constitutional warfare.</p>

<p>by Alex Thomas</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">(INTELLIHUB) — After two months of seemingly nonstop reports about urban military training throughout the United States, many readers of alternative media are rightfully worried about portions of the military being used against the American people.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In fact, officials <a href="https://www.intellihub.com/defense-official-warns-that-dod-directive-allowing-the-use-of-military-force-against-american-citizens-is-latest-step-towards-martial-law/" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'https://www.intellihub.com/defense-official-warns-that-dod-directive-allowing-the-use-of-military-force-against-american-citizens-is-latest-step-towards-martial-law/', 'WITHIN the Pentagon');" target="_blank"><span style="color: #0000ff;">WITHIN the Pentagon</span></a> have publicly voiced their concerns that President Obama may, “use force within the United States against its citizens.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With that being said, each and every announcement by the military of their different training activities is being scrutinized like never before with the <a href="http://dmna.ny.gov/news/?id=1433795643" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://dmna.ny.gov/news/?id=1433795643', 'latest news');" target="_blank"><span style="color: #0000ff;">latest news</span></a> raising eyebrows due to its connection to possible internment camps for American citizens.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">At least sixty soldiers from the 102nd Military Police Battalion’s Headquarters Detachment recently conducted their annual training at Fort Drum in a simulated detention center.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.oathkeepers.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Detention-Camp-2.jpg"><img alt="Detention Camp 2" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6746" height="272" src="https://www.oathkeepers.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Detention-Camp-2.jpg" width="440"/></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://dmna.ny.gov/news/?id=1433795643" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://dmna.ny.gov/news/?id=1433795643', 'A press release');" target="_blank"><span style="color: #0000ff;">A press release</span></a> detailed what the soldiers spent their time doing during the training which included practicing pat downs, biometric checks, and running detainees through hygiene stations. The troops also practiced conducting psychological evaluations.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“What we are conducting here are full-scale operations in order to bring everyone into the fold for what is necessary to run a detention facility properly,” said Capt. Nicholas Monuteaux in the release.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“It is very necessary to ensure all our military policemen and small engineer contingent develop, build or refine their duties and responsibilities.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">While the training in New York may very well be for use overseas (members of the same battalion have served at Guantanamo Bay) the fact remains that any announcement about training in detention centers instantly sparks fears due to the documented fact that plans for internment camps in America exist and could become a reality after some sort of massive unrest within the country.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://www.intellihub.com/police-militarization-preparation-for-economic-collapse-food-shortages-civil-unrest-and-martial-law/" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'https://www.intellihub.com/police-militarization-preparation-for-economic-collapse-food-shortages-civil-unrest-and-martial-law/', 'An extremely important and detailed essay');" target="_blank"><span style="color: #0000ff;">An extremely important and detailed essay</span></a> written by Timothy Pope and published on Intellihub News includes a list that highlights official federal government and military documentation that confirms that an extensive framework and infrastructure for internment camps in the United States does indeed exist.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In 2009 the <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/111/hr645/text" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/111/hr645/text', 'National Emergency Centers Act');" target="_blank"><span style="color: #0000ff;">National Emergency Centers Act</span></a> (H.R. 645), was introduced in Congress, mandating the establishment of “national emergency centers” to be located on military installations for the purpose of providing “temporary housing, medical, and humanitarian assistance to individuals and families dislocated due to an emergency or major disaster,” according to the bill. In addition to emergencies, this legislation is designed to “meet other appropriate needs, as determined by the Secretary of Homeland Security,” an open-ended mandate which could mean just about anything they want it to mean, including the forced detention of American citizens in the event of widespread rioting after a national emergency or total economic collapse.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">–</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In February of 2010 the <a href="https://info.publicintelligence.net/USArmy-InternmentResettlement.pdf" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'download', 'https://info.publicintelligence.net/USArmy-InternmentResettlement.pdf');" target="_blank"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Internment and Resettlement Operations</span></a> (FM 3-39.40) was leaked, a U.S. Army manual outlining policies for processing detainees into internment camps both globally and inside the United States. That is against the Law of Nations.</p>

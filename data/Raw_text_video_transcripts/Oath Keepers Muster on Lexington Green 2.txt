SR: When I first thought of OK. I want to make clear that I thought about this idea while I was working for Ron Paul’s campaign in Nevada as a volunteer, that was a year and a half ago. That was long before November elections, before we knew who would be in the White House, which party would be in control. It did not make a difference to me, or to the other two active-duty military and police and retired, it did not matter to any of us who would be president. We were gonna found this organization anyway. We understood the time had come to remind all of our brothers in arms of their obligations (0:00:45.4) to make sure they stood firm.

SR: I took the oath twice. First as a soldier, then as a lawyer. No doubt, many of you have dim views of lawyers. It is a sad fact that most politicians and lawyers, when they raise their right hand to take the oath, they roll their eyes and mumble the words because they don’t really mean them. There are some who do. We have some legislators here today who keep their oath. I as an attorney have done everything I can to keep my oath, sometimes at the harm of my practice. 

SR: There is one gentleman in our history who I consider to be the patron saint of patriot lawyers. Who would that be? James Otis. Do you know his story? (0:01:47.8) He was a lawyer in Boston, one of the founding patriots. He had the prestigious position, the equivalent of the Attorney General, he was that for the governor, for the Crown in Boston. In 1760, he was asked as part of his job as government lawyer to defend the writs of assistance, which were the general writs and warrants that allowed customs agents to search anywhere without probable cause, without having to go before a judge. The colonists understood that was an egregious violation of their natural rights to security and their personal effects, and the rights of Englishmen (0:02:31.8).

SR: He was asked to defend these writs. Do you think he did it? He did not. He refused. Not only did he refuse to defend the writs of assistance, he resigned his position and became a volunteer lawyer for colonists challenging the writs. (0:02:52.3) In a fiery oral argument, at least 4 hours long, he laid out the causes of the colonists. It was one of the first times. He stood up and said it’s a violation of the rights of Englishmen. This is the kind of abuse of power that cost one king his thrown and another king his head. He said this is the kind of thing we consider to violate not only the rights of Englishmen but also our natural rights. Many years later, John Adams said that, there the child of liberty was born. Out of a great multitude of men gathered in that hall, we all went away ready to take up arms against the writs of assistance. James Otis lost that case. The court ruled that the writs were perfectly constitutional under the English Constitution. Was that the end of the argument? No. The argument against the writs is where our 4th amendment comes from. It took 15 years of argument before shots were fired. But everything that happened there, we are seeing it again today. I’m said to say, but the long train of abuses that the Declaration of Independence lays out, it’s very frightening to look at that and see the parallels today. Denial of jury trial, confiscation of property, warrantless searches, the use of admiralty courts back then. No one was going to convict John Hancock, no jury in Boston would convict the smuggler John Hancock of being a smuggled. The crown knew they couldn’t rely on a jury, so they had to try someone like that in an admiralty court, whisked them across the seas to England, that was the extraordinary rendition of their day. Sadly, we see a lot of modern parallels, one of the most dangerous being that any president could declare any one of you to be an unlawful combatant, whether you’re a citizen or not, and sweep you out from under the protection of the Bill of Rights and try you by military tribunal. (0:05:24.9) As Patrick Henry said, it’s better to know the truth and face it and prepare for it. The truth is, there are many things done in the name of fighting the War on Terrorism that can be turned inward on you. You need to be alert and aware of how close we are to having our constitutional republic destroyed. (0:05:45.0)

SR: Today, we’re gonna have a couple speakers. We have Sheriff Richard Mack. RM long ago demonstrated his commitment to defend the Constitution, come what may for his career. We have Lt. Cdr. Guy Cunningham. He is the author of the 29 Palms survey from 1995 that asked Marines a series of questions, among them would they serve under U.S. command, and the most infamous was whether they would fire on Americans resisting attempts to disarm them. He knew the answer from most, but he wanted to find out because he was concerned about the erosion of knowledge among the troops about the Constitution. So long ago, he had already begun the work we’re attempting to continue. That’s why we invited him today, to speak about why he did that study, the results, and how it relates to OK mission. I also have my good friend Dave Freeman. DF is a retired Las Vegas Metro Police Department officer, rode motorcycles all over Las Vegas for 30 years. He’s my national liaison to police officers. His mission is to find one good, solid officer in each state, active or retired, who can serve as a liaison in that state. After we get done here today at 3, you are all invited to join us. His niece lives in Stow, she was the former Chief of Police there. She has opened her home, her bed and breakfast, to all of you, if you want to spend some time with us after 3 in brotherhood and sisterhood. (0:08:15.0) If you’re a veteran, I invite you to give your testimonial about what your oath means to you, we’re going to have camera crews there. It’s incredibly important that you do that. If you can’t make it there, grab anybody you see here with a camera. If we can get you on video, that’s a powerful outreach tool to current troops. It’s very important for vets, especially combat vets, if you’re willing, to say a couple minutes on video what you did and what your brothers did to defend the Constitution, and make sure they understand that their obligation is to follow in your footsteps. You’re speaking to them eye to eye in the camera is more powerful than anything I could ever say.

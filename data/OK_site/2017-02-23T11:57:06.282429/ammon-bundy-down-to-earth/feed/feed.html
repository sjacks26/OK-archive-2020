<content:encoded>You got that right. He is also a punk thief that burglarized a home and has a criminal record. I believe he has been arrested 3 times for criminal activities.

<content:encoded>We need to stick together here.  We veterans of the United States military need to stand strong for each other, and for our families.  We need to stop listening to cowards who didn’t have the nuts to serve like we did.  Bundy is one of those cowards.<br/>
Bundy wants to butter our bread, and will only stand behind us when bullets are flying, and he is finding a place to hide.  He wears camouflage like a warrior, but stayed behind with the women and kids when we men went to fight the enemies of our country.<br/>
I don’t get wrapped up in the paranoia that a lot of people here do.  I don’t get worried about the latest scare of rights violations.  I will protect what I’ve got.  I moved to a place where I trust law enforcement, and I don’t spotlight myself.<br/>
Punks like the Bundys want to start up a fight, but want us to do the hard part, just like they did when they refused to serve their country.  They want to talk the talk, but refused to walk the walk.<br/>
Where I’m from, he’s a bitch.

<content:encoded>Sorry, the first message I had to leave before I got to finish it and I guess the wrong key got hit and it got posted.  Sorry all!
<p>Bureaucracies are each under a branch of the government, and it matters not if it is state or general (federal). They lawfully are ALLOWED to use the powers/authority of the branch they are under – state or general (federal).  </p>
<p>The people elected to that branch are the same people REQUIRED to create, enforce, judge; while those who serve wtihin the bureaucracies are allowed to exist to ASSIST not go off on their own tangent and create anything that the ignorant might consider binding on the people and enforce it.</p>
<p>This is one of those things.  When the immediate boss of the bureaucracy ALLOWS those who are to ASSIST to “run” that part of the government then that elected representative is still PERSONALLY responsible – remember the Oath?</p>
<p>Those that are hired ONLY have the LAWFUL duty to assist those the people put into office.  That is the hallmark of the Separation of Powers and our Constitutional Republic.  The LCD was not given any lawful power over the people.  Powers usurped/assumed are NOT lawful nor binding on the people themselves.  </p>
<p>But the people doing this are *TRAITORS to the American people, and the US Constitution.  The force used to implement these usurped authority is **Terrorism against the American people.  They were REQUIRED – no matter what position they occupy – to take, and KEEP, a lawfully binding Oath in order to be able to LAWFULLY occupy the position they are in.</p>
<p>Breaking that Oath is at least one felony and the crime of perjury.</p>
<p>The first law statute of the United States of America, enacted in the first session of the First Congress on 1 June 1789, was Statute 1, Chapter 1: an act to regulate the time and manner of administering certain oaths, which established the oath required by civil and military officials to support the Constitution.</p>
<p>The requirement for all Federal and State Civil officers to give their solemn and binding Oath is established in Article VI, Section 1, Clause 4.</p>
<p>Once given, the Oath is binding for life, unless renounced, refused, and abjured. It does not cease upon the occasions of leaving office or of discharge.</p>
<p>Solemn: “Legally binding, Common legal phrase indicating that an agreement has been consciously made, and certain actions are now either required or prohibited. The other requirement for an agreement or contract to be considered legally binding is consideration – both parties must knowingly understand what they are agreeing to”<br/>
.<br/>
Bound: “Being under legal or moral obligation; to constitute the boundary or limit of; to set a limit to; confine” </p>
<p>Legally Binding: Common legal phrase. Lawful action, such as an agreement consciously agreed to by two or more entities, establishing lawful accountability. An illegal action, such as forcing, tricking, or coercing a person into an agreement, is not legally binding. Both parties knowingly understand what they are agreeing to is the other requirement to legally establish an agreement or contract. </p>
<p>Consideration: “Consideration in a contract is a bargained for exchange of acts or forbearance of an act.” </p>
<p>Require, Requirement, Required: Mandated under a law or by an authoritative entity. “To claim or ask for by right and authority; That which is required; a thing demanded or obligatory; something demanded or imposed as an obligation.”</p>
<p>Contract: “An agreement between two or more parties creating obligations that are enforceable or otherwise recognizable at law.”</p>
<p>The Framers placed the requirement for “Oaths of Office” in the Constitution. These Oaths are to function as “checks” on the powers of those that serve within the federal and state governments and to protect “We the people” from usurpations. </p>
<p>Each Branch of the federal government has “the check of the Oath” on the other two branches. The States, whose officials also take the Oath of Office, have the same check on all three branches of the federal government. And “We the People”, the “original fountain of all legitimate authority” (Federalist 22), have the Right to overrule violations of the Constitution by elected and appointed officials.</p>
<p>Federal law regulating oath of office by government officials – state and federal is divided into four parts along with an executive order that further defines the law for purposes of enforcement.</p>
<p>5 U.S.C. 3331, provides the text of the actual oath of office the three branches of our government, the military, all law enforcement, the heads of the States, all federal employees are required to take before assuming office.</p>
<p>5 U.S.C. 3333 requires the three branches of our government, the military, all law enforcement, the heads of the States, all federal employees sign an affidavit that they have taken the oath of office required by 5 U.S.C. 3331 and have not or will not violate that oath of office during their tenure of office as defined by the third part of the law.</p>
<p>18 U.S.C. 1918 provides penalties for violation of oath of office described in 5 U.S.C. 7311 which include: (1) removal from office and; (2) confinement or a fine.</p>
<p>5 U.S.C. 7311 which explicitly makes it a federal criminal offense for anyone employed in the United States Government to “advocate the overthrow of our constitutional form of government”. </p>
<p>The definition of “advocate” is further specified in Executive Order 10450 which for the purposes of enforcement supplements 5 U.S.C. 7311.</p>
<p>Executive Order 10450 provision specifies it is a violation of 5 U.S.C. 7311 for any person taking the oath of office to advocate “the alteration … of the form of the government of the United States by unconstitutional means.”</p>
<p>Our form of government is defined by the Constitution of the United States.<br/>
Thus, according to Executive Order 10450 (and therefore 5 U.S. 7311) any act taken by government officials who have taken the oath of office prescribed by 5 U.S.C. 3331 which alters the form of government other then by amendment, is a criminal violation of the 5 U.S.C. 7311. </p>
<p>Inalienable rights: “a right according to natural law, a right that cannot be taken away, denied, or transferred”</p>
<p>18 USC § 241 – Conspiracy against rights: If two or more persons conspire to injure, oppress, threaten, or intimidate any person in any State, Territory, Commonwealth, Possession, or District in the free exercise or enjoyment of any right or privilege secured to him by the Constitution or laws of the United States, or because of his having so exercised the same; or<br/>
If two or more persons go in disguise on the highway, or on the premises of another, with intent to prevent or hinder his free exercise or enjoyment of any right or privilege so secured—<br/>
They shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than ten years, or both; and if death results from the acts committed in violation of this section or if such acts include kidnapping or an attempt to kidnap, aggravated sexual abuse or an attempt to commit aggravated sexual abuse, or an attempt to kill, they shall be fined under this title or imprisoned for any term of years or for life, or both, or may be sentenced to death.</p>
<p>So, according to the Supreme Law of this nation and the other laws that are in Pursuance thereof it the people who serve within that LCD and allowed this to go on must be removed, etc for breaking their Oath.  Those who actually did those deeds must be charged and prosecuted for Treason, Perjury, etc since they are working AGAINST the American people and the US Constitution, our legitimate government.</p>
<p>Webster’s 1828 Dictionary says for “Constitution”: “…In free states, the constitution is paramount to the statutes or laws enacted by the legislature, limiting and controlling its power; and in the United States, the legislature is created, and its powers designated, by the constitution. If any Branch fails to obey the “supreme Law”, then, in order to preserve the Rule of Law, the other Branches, or failing that, the States or the people, must overrule them”.</p>
<p>Alexander Hamilton, Fed 33: “If a number of political societies enter into a larger political society, the laws which the latter may enact, pursuant to the powers intrusted [sic] to it by its constitution, must necessarily be supreme over those societies and the individuals of whom they are composed…. But it will not follow from this doctrine that acts of the larger society which are not pursuant to its constitutional powers, but which are invasions of the residuary authorities of the smaller societies, will become the supreme law of the land. These will be merely acts of usurpation, and will deserve to be treated as such.” </p>
<p>“An officer who acts in violation of the constitution ceases to represent the government.” Brookfield Construction Company V. Stewart 284 F Sup. 94</p>

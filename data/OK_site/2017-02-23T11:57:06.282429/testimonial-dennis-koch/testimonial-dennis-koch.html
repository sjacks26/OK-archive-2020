<p>Testimonial:  I did not wear the uniform of the USA. Now is my time to serve.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Many are waking to the vast landscape of crimes being committed by our own<br/>
government against its people.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To those who are not, the time has arrived to ‘get interested’. You will not be unaffected and you will NOT like the ways your life will change if you do not discover and tend to your own interests, your safety and your family’s future while you still can.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There have always been those who crave control of others. For generations, there has been incremental damage to America’s framework of liberty that is truly every human’s birthright. But it is the brilliant US Constitution, in particular, with which we’ve been blessed in our natural rights being recognized and guaranteed. It is this that has so long provided an inviting light to the oppressed of the world.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Alarmingly, recent days and events show that those in power think they have reached ‘critical mass’ and are now more obvious than ever in seizing the freedoms we are assured. They are emboldened. They arrogantly, shamelessly, cruelly impose their wills, ignore valid laws and invent fictions while making the most ridiculous claims against logic. All the time herding ‘sheeple’ into pens preparing the slaughter of their sovereignty.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Witness a bloated, cancerous government that refuses to perform the few, simple and limited duties for which it was created. Primary among them: Sustain our borders to allow those within to live unmolested. And related: Stand between our citizens and those individuals or groups that would injure them.</p>
<p>Those missions are NOT accomplished.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Instead it steals from its people through taxation and inflation. It squanders blood and treasure on doomed adventures abroad. It sacrifices heroes and rewards criminality, partnering with evil entities in contravention of its charge of stewardship and protection. Choosing instead to entertain enemies on our own soil, meddle in matters purely personal, and criminalize law-abiding citizens. Empowering any immoral cause and disdaining every founding principle.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">See it moving swiftly now, and in earnest, to disarm Americans. Using every conceivable ploy, every tortured logic, and all of the powers it has acquired at<br/>
every level to reduce citizens to harmless subjects.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Once Americans are defenseless, every other design on them has no obstacle. As the gate closes on their pen, their impotent bleating will be the only annoyance that remains but that will be easy to endure as it will have no consequence and the vital task will be complete.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Should the Second Amendment fall to Enemies Domestic the entire Constitution will be rendered irrelevant – a moot relic and dim reminder of people who once were the owners of themselves. Its timeless wisdom replaced by the whim and fancy of the criminals and fools of the day. Only three groups – their impact profound – endorse the new plan: The Ignorant, the Stupid and the Villainous.</p>
<p>This is a watershed moment.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There is a large population of patriots and wise men and women who are digging in now to say ‘Enough!’.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Moreover, there is a small band of principled and courageous individuals who are standing in defiance to declare: “Not on our watch”.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Of prime example is the growing number of heroic Sheriffs – the supreme law enforcement officers in the land – along with many other police and military personnel all over America who are refusing commands to disarm their countrymen. They are pushing back against the tyranny brought by Federal and State politicians and agencies – their unconstitutional (and therefore invalid) edicts and laws directed and aided by bureaucrats and other functionaries from their moneyed friends and foreign influencers to an academia gone mad and incompetent, corrupt and complicit mainstream ‘news’ media. Brave men and women are knowingly putting their reputations, livelihoods, retirements, and even their personal liberty and safety in danger at this very moment.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is not to be dismissed as ‘just politics’. Scattered, criminal forces that have been grinding slowly in this country for over a hundred years are now coalescing swiftly. The divine experiment known as the United States of America is nearing extinction and enormous evil is poised to fill the void.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Wickedness within the halls of control will not shrink nor back down willingly. A free people cannot permit it to prevail. The stakes are too high – the dangers too grave. The rest of the world awaits our fate. Its future is ours to write.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Consult that Great Force that brought you to this time and place. To those with integrity may you honor yourselves and all that is just by standing now.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I understand I offer my neck to the swords of ignorance and cowardice. So be it.</p>

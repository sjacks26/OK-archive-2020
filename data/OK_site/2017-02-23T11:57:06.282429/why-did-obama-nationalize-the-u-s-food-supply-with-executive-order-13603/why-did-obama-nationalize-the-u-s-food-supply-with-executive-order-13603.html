<p><em>This article was written by J.D. Heyes and originally published at <a href="http://www.naturalnews.com/050940_Obama_executive_orders_food_supply.html" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.naturalnews.com/050940_Obama_executive_orders_food_supply.html', 'Natural News');">Natural News</a></em></p>
<p>In March 2012, President Obama quietly signed an Executive Order that has major implications should some sort of national emergency arise, such as enabling the federal government to take over management and distribution of all food, water and other resources.</p>
<p>In issuing the order, <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2012/03/16/executive-order-national-defense-resources-preparedness" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2012/03/16/executive-order-national-defense-resources-preparedness', 'EO 13603');">EO 13603</a>, titled, “National Defense Resources Preparedness,” Obama claimed authority under the Defense Production Act of 1950, a Korean War-era statute (50 U.S.C.) (see it <a href="http://www.acq.osd.mil/mibp/dpac/final__defense_production_act_091030.pdf" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'download', 'http://www.acq.osd.mil/mibp/dpac/final__defense_production_act_091030.pdf');">here</a>) that gives the government the power to marshal whatever resources are necessary to protect and defend the country during “military conflicts, natural or man-caused disasters, or acts of terrorism within the United States,” the statute says.</p>
<p>In justifying the order, Obama wrote in Section 102 under “Policy:”</p>
<p><em>The United States must have an industrial and technological base capable of meeting national defense requirements and capable of contributing to the technological superiority of its national defense equipment in peacetime and in times of national emergency. The domestic industrial and technological base is the foundation for national defense preparedness. The authorities provided in the Act shall be used to strengthen this base and to ensure it is capable of responding to the national defense needs of the United States.</em></p>
<p><strong>If you like your <a href="http://www.naturalnews.com/food.html" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.naturalnews.com/food.html', 'food');">food</a>, you can’t keep it</strong></p>
<p>Among other things, the order directs various federal agencies and government officials to “identify requirements for the full spectrum of emergencies, including essential military and civilian demand,” and “assess on an ongoing basis the capability of the domestic industrial and technological base to satisfy requirements in peacetime and times of national emergency, specifically evaluating the availability of the most critical resource and production sources, including subcontractors and suppliers, materials, skilled labor, and professional and technical personnel.”</p>
<p>In addition, the order directs government agencies “to take actions necessary to ensure the availability of adequate resources and production capability, including services and critical technology, for national <a href="http://www.naturalnews.com/defense.html" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.naturalnews.com/defense.html', 'defense');">defense</a> requirements.”</p>
<p>The order is specifically directed at the Defense Department and Department of Homeland Security, as well as the National Security Council and the Homeland Security Council, the latter two which are advisory bodies to the Executive branch. But several other Cabinet-level agencies, including the Energy Department and, importantly, the Department of Agriculture.</p>
<p>The need for government to not only ensure its functionality but also its survival during a time of emergency is understandable; all governments do this. But the timing of the order – as well as the motivation for issuing it – is what remains suspect.</p>
<p>Radio personality Dave Hodges, <a href="http://www.thecommonsenseshow.com/2015/08/02/obama-nationalizes-all-food-and-this-will-force-millions-of-americans-into-fema-camps/" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.thecommonsenseshow.com/2015/08/02/obama-nationalizes-all-food-and-this-will-force-millions-of-americans-into-fema-camps/', 'in a blog post');">in a blog post</a>, particularly noted the order’s emphasis on the confiscation of all “food resources,” which are defined in the order as “all commodities and products, (simple, mixed, or compound), or complements to such commodities or products, that are capable of being ingested by either human beings or animals, irrespective of other uses to which such commodities or products may be put…”</p>
<p><strong>Acquire storable food ‘off the grid?’</strong></p>
<p>In addition, he notes, “food resources” includes “all potable water” and every imaginable agricultural product.</p>
<p>What is disturbing, he writes, is the order’s potential implication for anyone who is storing food in their homes or in special locations for consumption in the event of an emergency. The order – and indeed, the 1950 act – appear to grant the government such authority.</p>
<p>Also, Hodges notes, way back in 2008, before Barack Obama was elected to his first term, the Bush administration <a href="http://www.wnd.com/2008/07/70281/" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.wnd.com/2008/07/70281/', 'began mass purchases of storable foods');">began mass purchases of storable foods</a>, something that alarmed food sellers at the time.</p>
<p>It’s not clear what enforcement mechanisms would be employed by the administration should the president declare a national emergency and order stockpiled food confiscated, but such a scenario is unsettling on many levels. Not only would families be disrupted and immediately dependent upon federal, state and local agencies for subsidence, but there very likely would be violence directed toward any government agency or military unit instructed to confiscate private food stores.</p>
<p>Some have suggested bartering or using cash as ways to acquire storable foods “off the grid,” so as not to flag yourself like you would with any purchases using debit or credit cards.</p>

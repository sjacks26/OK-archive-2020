Jason Van Tatenhove: [00:00:13] OK folks this is Jason Van Tatenhove with Oath Keepers. I'm here with Mike Adams of natural news with Episode 2 of our winter prepping series. Mike how are you doing today. Thanks for joining us. 

Mike Adams: [00:00:28] Hey Jason. I am doing great thanks for the invitation of happy to have to join you and help spread some good information here. 

Jason Van Tatenhove: [00:00:34] Awesome. What we were hoping to talk with you about that the idea of prepping your body for winter. You know everyone's thinking about you know fuel storage and and how to deal with your storable food with freezing and making sure you have enough wood on hand or kerosene and heating your home. But I think a lot of people don't think about what we need to do to prep our bodies for winter and that there is definitely something to that. So I figured you'd be the best person that I know of any way to talk about that. So. 

Mike Adams: [00:01:04] Well absolutely. Again thanks for the invite just a little background for those of your listeners who might not be familiar with my work I'm been a longtime nutritionist. I'm a science lab director at for for clean food testing elemental analysis and I'm also you know a patriot, conceal carry holder, and a long range target shooter. So one of the things that I'm doing just skill wise right now is brushing up on all my long range shooting with my .338 Lapua and this winter I'm stretching out to about 1350 yards. That's that's that's what I'm working on right now. So. Never, Never hurts to be able to reach out like that right now and. 

Jason Van Tatenhove: [00:01:43] You know it's actually kind of funny you mentioned I was talking to one of the other people kind of higher up in the Oath Keepers organization mouse, A lot of people know. he was telling me how he was his big push this winter has been his long range shooting as well. He took a train a couple of other guns for a really nice long range rifle and has been just training training training with it and just loving it. So I think a lot of people you know we all have our ARs and our side arms but that long range is definitely. I know myself personally I've got to get more brushing up on it. 

Mike Adams: [00:02:12] You know it's if you don't mind me taking a tangent on this. I love long range shooting because at the same time that I'm a science lab director and I've run all this instrumentation. To me long range target shooting is has a lot of the same methodology and mathematics. You're doing a lot of unit conversion. Just like you are in the lab. I when I when I studied long range shooting it makes instant sense to me because I'm so familiar with a lot of the mathematics of laboratory analysis. and it just it feels so good to be able to really do the math, do the modeling, understand the ballistics, and have some good glass. You don't put put put a bullet on target first shot, cold-bore shot. and to be able to hit that at you know even seven hundred yards or a thousand yards it's just you know it's a it's a great feeling it's very rewarding for me. 

Jason Van Tatenhove: [00:03:03] I don't do the math side of things. But you know I do the hunting and I try to do as best I can when shooting but I'm not able to do those calculations again. That is part of my skill set I definitely have to add do I need to go to a good class for it and learn how to do all that. And definitely Mike what you know in the upcoming training sessions. 

Mike Adams: [00:03:22] Well you've got to get down to West Texas and go get down to accuracy first. And that's the system I use their ballistic software in all their system. It's it's really fantastic. It's just it makes instant sense has got simplified formulas for windage correction things like that. It's just fantastic. Anyway, I didn't mean to get off target. 

Jason Van Tatenhove: [00:03:39] Oh no topic. Now we kind of want to go where the conversation takes us so but let's get back to winter prepping So let's let's talk about what people need to think about when they're looking at prepping their body for the coming winter. 

Mike Adams: [00:03:54] Absolutely. Well the first thing I want to address is the myth of what is healthy going into the winter. If you look at bodybuilding magazines and you look at mainstream media and so on they try to present bodies that are really ripped and really low low body fat as this image of being healthy and strong. That's a complete myth. When you're going into the winter you actually need body fat. Especially if you live in up north like you are. you need more body fat in the winter and the cycle of human nutrition is supposed to be that you actually store fat in the fall. You use fat in the winter. It's an insulation. Let's face it. It actually gives you insulation keeps you warmer. And then in the spring you're actually letting go of fat because you're more active you're more you're outdoors more you're sweating more you're eating more spring greens and things like that homegrown lettuce. hopefully hopefully you know how to grow some of your own food. And that's when you let go of your fat and then in the summer you're hot. So you want to be more lean. In the summer and then the cycle repeats. So number one I want to make people aware that your level of body fat should actually cycle with the seasons and that's not something that people have ever really heard before. 

Jason Van Tatenhove: [00:05:07] Now what kind of fat should they be looking at in taking it were they going to get it from. 

Mike Adams: [00:05:12] Well what I recommend is do not fatten up off of carbohydrates that will give you diabetes or hypoglycemia so you don't want to fatten up on corn. That's what cattle are doing. You know they feed cattle genetically modified corn to fatten up in the minimum amount of time. And it's really not healthy for them but most of those cattle don't live But a few years anyway. So they don't really have the time to develop diabetes. Otherwise you'd see a lot of diabetic cows all over the place which would be odd. but humans if you just keep eating carbohydrates are going to eat you're going to probably get something like type 2 diabetes, so healthy fats are the answer. Healthy fats obviously include all the plant based fats like avocados, chia seeds, flax seeds, anything like that. but also some saturated animal fat I believe is very important for the winter. Some people you know there are vegans and vegetarians out there who say you shouldn't never eat animal fat or animal products. And I disagree with that. I think you need to eat clean meats and clean animal fats. In other words from free range cows not injected with crazy hormones and chemicals and all these other you know toxic substances and preferably not fed genetically modified grain. 

Mike Adams: [00:06:24] So what you really want to find is somebody a rancher that you know who will butcher a cow every once in a while and you'll be able to purchase you know a quarter of that cow and have some freezer space. You'll get bones, you get meat, you get different cuts of meat and also the healthy fat. Now the bones are really really important for winter because even in chinese medicine, they recommend doing what's called a bone broth soup and you take just a big cut of bone and gristle you know right off of. Right out of the butcher shop and you throw it in a pot of water and you boil that and you really boil it for several hours and then you throw in some other things like some carrots, celery, or onions or whatever whatever you want even some Kanwar quinoa if you want to do that and you create a bone broth soup. This soup is very very invigorating for cold times. And in fact I've actually heard of vegans rescuing themselves from really being chilled and cold all the time by having a big big bowl of bone broth soup and then restore their energy, their vitality, even their ability to think. So I want you to think about the value of bone broth soup. I don't want you to over consume meat and meat fat. You shouldn't be having bacon every day. There are problems with bacon with the sodium nitrate that's added to it. Right. But you know do your meat in moderation. But understand that it does have a very important role in being healthy and warm and comfortable during a winter. and especially in a survival winter scenario, you're going to need a lot of heavy duty calories from animal fat. And I'm talking about lard for example. Like if you're in a survival situation and it's the winter and it's very very cold and you're actually threatened by the cold you can use lard with let's say dehydrated potatoes for example just boil the potatoes. Get those add some butter, add some lard, add some salt. That is a meal that will keep you alive in the winter. 

Jason Van Tatenhove: [00:08:23] Great. No I got a question for you. So up here in the great white north where I live in northern Montana a lot of us don't really eat much meat other than the meat that we hunt. I knew that my freezer is mostly filled with venison and elk that I take in and we use that through the year from hunting. and it's so plentiful up here that most people they don't buy much meat at the store. they're only eating because you know your friends are giving it to you is just all over the place. So when you're on a diet with that those are both very very lean meats right. Do you need to supplement some some other fat like beef fat or whatnot into them too to help bolster like you're talking about. 

Mike Adams: [00:09:05] Not really not. Not if you're using the fat parts of the animal when you process it. It's actually important during the processing of animals that are hunted to keep the fat with the meat and not just try to get lean cuts whether it's deer or elk as you mentioned or in Texas, Even wild hogs some people harvest wild hogs for meat. They tend to have a lot more fat by the way so not a problem there. But I don't think you need to add lard to it from other sources if you're getting wild game meat. It's so clean to begin with it's such a high quality meat. I would just go with that and just make sure you're consuming the fat that is available with that animal. In other words don't discard the fat. 

Jason Van Tatenhove: [00:09:49] Gotcha. Well Mike what are some of the ways that we can boost your immune system. we know that come in in the fall. The school year starts in it's just the season for the flu. You've got these these vaccine pushers telling you that the answer is the flu vaccine and we know that's just not the case. That's a whole lot of propaganda and it is much better off not taking that vaccine. because they admittedly it's never the right strain it never really does anything it just kind of a big fraud and more dangerous than anything. but what can we do naturally to avoid getting sick? how can we bolster our immune system coming into the winter season when all these clues and colds are going around. 

Mike Adams: [00:10:31] It's very simple the answer is vitamin D. I remember that in the winter your body is using up stores of vitamin D that it puts away in the liver. Now in the spring, in the summer when you have more sunlight exposure, that ultraviolet radiation is interacting with your skin to produce vitamin D which is really a pre-hormone. It's it's not technically a vitamin. It's a pre-hormone and then your skin absorbs that transdermally obviously. And vitamin D 3 then is transformed by your kidneys and it circulates in your blood and it is absolutely crucial for immune system function. You can think of vitamin D as a genetic code activator. Almost 25 percent of your genetic code and a lot of people don't know this but almost 25 percent is geared towards protecting you from invading microbes, parasites, and other microorganisms. You come from a long line of survivors, your ancestors, who lived and survived and reproduced long before vaccines ever came into existence which by the way completely blows away the whole vaccine argument that you need a vaccine to survive. No you don't. If your how did you even get here. If your ancestors there were no vaccines you know so how how did they survive. The answer is they had. Immunity. Your immune system will build its own antibodies to exposure to influenza. Sometimes in a symptomless way meaning you won't even get a sniffle you won't get a fever or nothing you don't even know you were exposed. Your body is exposed to it. 

Mike Adams: [00:12:01] It builds antibodies but it needs vitamin D in order to activate the genetic code that builds the proteins necessary for this process to happen. So when your vitamin D deficient. and by the way if you listen to this and you are dark skinned and the darker your skin the more you need to listen up the more sunblock you have to ultraviolet radiation in your skin pigmentation, meaning the more deficient you're going to be in vitamin D especially during the winter months. So you need to boost up the vitamin D through oral supplementation especially during the winter. Another benefit of that is that vitamin D helps halt the growth of cancer tumors. We know from studying cancer in quite in depth that people who are diagnosed with cancer tumors those tumors have usually been growing for 10 sometimes 20 or 25 years but they only grow typically in the winter. A lot of people don't know this either. The tumors are halted in their growth during the summer and the spring months because that's when people are getting sunlight and vitamin D Vitamin D runs out and they're deficient that's when the tumor grows in the winter. And so you can halt tumor growth all year round in most cases by just having good vitamin D stores in your liver which means oral consumption of vitamin D supplements. So anyway that's to me that's the most important supplement for immune boosting and immunity period. The flu vaccine is a complete hoax is absolute quackery it does not work. It's usually the wrong strain. And even if it does work it does not give your body a full strength immune response to the influenza virus. It gives you a half assed response that that may not protect you. So the best way to build immunity to influenza is to have a strong immune system and then actually be exposed to influenza and allow your body to build the antibodies itself in response to the live virus not a weakened virus like that use in vaccines. 

Jason Van Tatenhove: [00:13:53] What about magnesium I've heard we're as a country just very deprived of magnesium and that that also plays a role in the immune system. Is it good information or is it not. 

Mike Adams: [00:14:07] Yeah that's that's good information. I wouldn't put at the top of my list of immunity, magnesium usually that deficiency is related to cardiovascular events. High blood pressure you know heart attacks that kind of thing. Magnesium is very very important that it carries oxygen in your blood cells. So Or I should say it's part of it part of what carries oxygen is it's part of the molecules that carry oxygen in your blood cells. So you need magnesium you need it in every cell but it for immunity I think zinc is actually a better a better focus. Zinc a lot of people are zinc deficient zinc not only boost immune function but it also accelerates skin repair. If you have skin damage if you have cut an injury or a wound, if it's not healing very quickly it could be because your zinc deficient so going into a winter or even a survival situation you need to be vitamin D ready and zinc ready and also magnesium ready for that matter you know think about this too. A lot of people are are are prepping these days right there prepping for an EMP attack or who knows a terrorist attack, maybe ISIS gets activated across America and blows up a bunch of refineries or something there's a fuel shortage. you're not going to be able to go out and get Vitamin D supplements. You know the stores are going to be wiped out the pharmacies forget it. It was going to be death zones. If you show up at a pharmacy in a collapse you better bring your shotgun you know, because everybody else is going to be there first trying to get all the medications. So don't count on being able to go out and get the stuff. If there's an emergency. you better be prepared with the nutrition that you need and the best place to have those nutritional stores actually is in your body. your liver will store vitamin D for months. Some vitamins you can't store very well like Vitamin C actually is gone in 24 hours so you got to take that every day. But vitamin D is fat soluble vitamin. So it will actually be stored in your liver. And some doctors for vitamin D deficient patients they'll prescribe something like 50000 IUs at a time. I'm not recommending that that's a lot. You need to work with a doctor if you if you think you even need that. But that 50000 IUs can last a person several months. So it's a lot to learn about this. I'm just scratching the surface now. 

Jason Van Tatenhove: [00:16:18] You mentioned vitamin C there. I know that a lot of people are getting their vitamin C from absorbic acid. And I've heard from other people that I've talked to on my radio show and whatnot that that is not such a good source to get your vitamin C from. What are your thoughts on that. 

Mike Adams: [00:16:34] Well my thoughts on this have really changed recently because I've done a lot of study on vitamin C and what you mentioned ascorbic acid. Here's my opinion on this. Ascorbic acid is actually it can be a very very therapeutic source of vitamin C. However you don't want to get it from China. Most of the ascorbic acid is derived from genetically modified corn that's processed in China in the chemical laboratories. I searched for months to actually find and bottle, we're actually rolling this out, some ascorbic acid supplements that are manufactured that are. I'm sorry the raw materials made in Ireland and not China. And it is very therapeutic in that form because it's so potent. Now the other form that I recommend is sodium ascorbate which is simply ascorbic acid that buffered with the sodium mineral base. So that is easier to put into smoothies. It tastes more neutral. It's not tangy is not highly acidic. 

Mike Adams: [00:17:30] However. You asked me a question you like it's opening a can of worms has so many angles to go in there but. ascorbic acid in in pill form in a capsule form actually can be very very useful for a lot of people during meals. And here's why. many people have weak gastric acid and they have incomplete digestion of the foods they're consuming. This causes indigestion and unfortunately they tend to take alkaline supplements like Tums thinking that they're too acidic. But in my experience most people are actually not acidic enough. That's why they're not digesting. So if you actually take ascorbic acid in capsule form or powder form during a meal it can enhance digestion and help eliminate indigestion and actually decrease things like uric acid crystals which can circulate in your blood, lodge in your joints, and cause you to think you have rheumatoid arthritis. When you really don't. 

Mike Adams: [00:18:24] So I'm going to be recommending that people consider taking ascorbic acid with meals and this is especially true or charred meats or anything that contain that is cooked or slightly burned or charred or barbecued. The vitamin C that's in the pills counteracts the carcinogenic effects of the burned parts of the meat that you're eating. And this is also true with you know you've heard about beef jerky and pepperoni and all these processed meats cause cancer right. Well that's because of the sodium nitrate that's added to them which is a color fixer and also an anti-bacterial agent that prevents botulism. But if you take vitamin C with the meal at the same time that you're eating these hot dogs or pepperoni or whatever the vitamin C blocks the nitrocimene forming action of the sodium nitrite. In other words buffering or blocking the carcinogenic process and not trying to get too technical but. But vitamin C taken during a meal can can have a very powerful protective effect. 

Jason Van Tatenhove: [00:19:22] Awesome. Great. I had no idea. All right. Well let's talk a little bit about, say we're prepping is let's say there might be a grid down scenario. How important you know are we talking about pharmacies not being, you know being overrun ransacked whatnot. How do you feel people should be prepping for antibiotics. Do we need to have some on hand if we want to go get you know some of these pet store type antibiotics. What's the best way to to store those up or are there alternatives that we should be looking at. 

Mike Adams: [00:19:57] There are really I think three approaches to this. One of them like you said is typically fish antibiotics right. You can go online you can buy antibiotics for your fish aquarium. Here's the here's the danger in that. unless you are really well-informed about the proper dosage how many milligrams for example of this chemical per kilogram of body weight of the person that you're treating. Unless you know those formulas or have a reference book for those formulas, you could probably kill somebody because you don't know what you're doing. So I want to put that alert out there. Secondly these antibiotic chemicals are very very different in the kinds of tissues that they're able to get to. some antibiotics are really really good at getting to the lungs. Other antibiotics are completely useless at that. Some go to the genital area and are good for prostate or reproductive organs for example. Others are completely useless. So you know ear infections are going to be treated differently from lung infections. And if you don't know this information you're just shooting in the dark. So it's kind of like you know you don't want to give somebody a like a full auto rifle if they've never gone through a gun safety class. I mean so if you're going to use antibiotics you need to know what the hell you're doing. 

Mike Adams: [00:21:07] The second approach to this which has a lot more leeway for mis-, a miscalculation is to go with plant based antibiotics. There are some excellent books out there that cover all the herbal antibiotics that are available. In fact I think that's the title of one of the books you can get on Amazon. It's just called herbal antibiotics and I recommend you get some of these books and keep them as a reference. But if you're going to do that you need to be growing as many of these herbs as you can so. Growing them means you've got to have some kind of a growth system. Well you know I, I invented the food rising mini farm grow box system. you can find that online at food rising org. I show you how to make your own you can make it out of almost any container. It's very cheap and easy to make. and you can grow basil and you can grow cilantro. You can grow you know all kinds lemon balm herbs, thyme, Rosemary, all these things. And I strongly recommend that you do that. 

Mike Adams: [00:22:04] The third approach to this is essential oils essential oils are of course the distillate concentrates of these medicinal herbs that you could grow yourself. These oils some of them are used externally some are internally some are both. And I'm talking about like the eucalyptus, peppermint oil, sandalwood oil, all these things lots of essential oils out there. In my opinion every person's medicine chest should include a full complement of essential oils. And once again you have to know what you're doing with them so I recommend you buy a reference book. You don't have to memorize it. just have the book on your shelf where you know like you can go to that book and you can look up which oil is good for one thing. Same same thing you should have for antibiotics, you should have that reference book on the shelf. You don't have to memorize it, you just have to be able to know where to find that information When the internet's down. Right. So in both of these cases and I actually recommend you do you do the whole spectrum if you can. have some fish antibiotics which are hardcore isolated chemicals, very potent, very dangerous. Have some herbs that are growing more mild. Easier to use on people with a wider safety margin but sometimes not as effective for acute infections. And then thirdly go for the essential oils and know how to use them. 

Jason Van Tatenhove: [00:23:22] All right well what else do you think we need to be thinking of when getting ready for winter in this prepping your body. One thought. 

Mike Adams: [00:23:33] Well gosh. So many so many areas to cover here. I want to say that. Be mindful of who you're hanging around with if there's something if there is infectious disease going around. Most people are not healthy. Most people are taking the flu shots which means their immune systems are compromised. They've been injected with aluminum and Mercury. Most people have really crappy diets. Most people do not eat well. they don't have good vitamin D for example. So it is other people that have the greatest risk to infecting you. So whatever scenario you're in, maybe everything's fine you're having a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year celebration. And there are no terrorist attacks. There is no collapse. All the lights are on everything's cool. But still other people are your greatest risk because they are the carriers and they don't take care of their own health. 

Mike Adams: [00:24:30] Now in a collapse scenario, if crazy stuff hits the fan this winter, and you you find yourself you know in desperate situation ,an infection can quite literally kill you. You know infection in the wrong the wrong disease and turns out that infection spread very very quickly once basic services break down. Even even even infections that right now are treatable in the hospital people don't have access to that in in a collapse scenario. But also even right now hospitals can kill you with their superbugs. so you can go into a hospital for a relatively minor procedure they can infect you with something like C-diff. see C-diff kill you it kills thousands of people a year. Right now you know superbug deaths are very very high thousands. So really protecting your immune system and also being having some, Having some items that can sanitize surfaces is also very important. So having some povodone iodine on hand, you know first aid iodine. having some surface sanitizers on hand is very important. Some bleach obviously is very important. if things get crazy you need to keep your environment as clean as possible that's how you're going to protect your health. 

Jason Van Tatenhove: [00:25:47] Mike what are your thoughts on ionic silver and colloidal silver. I know a lot of people that are in my community swear by, I have used it to great effect. but again I defer to your judgment because I know that you've really studied in depth on this stuff. So what are your thoughts. 

Mike Adams: [00:26:04] I love it. I love ionic silver, colloidal silver and but also ionic copper. both silver and copper Very very strong anti-bacterial properties. They they destroy the cell membranes of bacteria. And if you, it it almost doesn't even matter what parts per million concentration they are. I know there's a lot of debate among different manufacturers on companies like ours ten parts per million. Another company says well that's too high. Should be one part per million silver. There's a lot of debate but they're all effective to some degree. All of them. What's great about colloidal silver is that you can make your own. Right. And if you have a just a generator even power with something as small as a 9 volt battery can actually create a certain amount of of colloidal silver that can be very very effective for you. and you don't even have to have very pure silver if you're going to use it topically. So a lot of people who make colloidal silver they like to use four nines silver but maybe you don't have four nine silver Maybe you only have three nights maybe you have a silver coin. You can actually make colloidal silver out of a silver coin and you can use that topically on your skin. You can put it under bandages if you get a burn wound. You can put colloidal silver under the bandage on the wound and it will prevent skin infection. This should be use globally in burn wards. It should be used everywhere in emergency first aid situations but it's not. 

Mike Adams: [00:27:34] For internal use. Let me mention this. Internal use is also there's a very wide safety margin but it is not something to be consumed every single day like drinking you know Pepsi or something. You don't want to drink it every day you know year after here but it's not at all harmful to drink this. If you're if you're trying to treat an acute infection that's reachable through your gastrointestinal tract. However if you do that, remember you're going to destroy your intestinal flora. It's to screw up your digestion and compromise your immune system. So you need to take probiotics after using colloidal silver internally to re-establish the healthy flora of your digestive tract in a sense. 

Jason Van Tatenhove: [00:28:13] Yeah I can speak personally to that. I make my wife as many of our viewers know suffers from Crohn's disease and the best way we found put her in remission was actually through a gut flora kill off using colloidal silver that we generated ourselves at home and then we repopulated her gut flora with a live enzyme from raw milk. We made a kefir out of it. She never did better and really put her right into remission and took care of that side of her issues through that method so I can personally vouch for that. Absolutely is a very powerful tool. Now you had mentioned ionic copper. can you use like I use the silver lung's generator I like using the generator because I can, I can specify 20 parts or 40 parts it spells it out. I was concerned at first because you heard these stories about the Blue Man and whatnot. 

Mike Adams: [00:29:06] And those are scare stories, nonsense. 

Jason Van Tatenhove: [00:29:08] But it seems like they already have everything figured out for you it's easy to do and I was concerned about you know not getting it right trying to build one myself. 

Mike Adams: [00:29:18] So Silverlungs is great. I own I own one of those too. What's what's great about that is you have that nebulizer for inhaling it. I think if we had something like a pandemic break out of Ebola or or even like a let's say a drug resistant tuberculosis which is out there. something like that really began to spread I think that that inhaling colloidal silver in your lungs could be really life saving. That's my opinion. The CDC will probably disagree will say no you need a you need poisoned vaccine. But I think I think that silver lungs could save a lot of lives. 

Mike Adams: [00:29:52] Now. Here's something interesting if you study the table of elements remember from physics class in high school or chemistry class. and I work with this table everyday in the lab. if you look at it you'll notice that copper and silver and gold are all in the same column. It's in the section of the table called transition metals and these metals are very dynamic in the way they interact with other other atoms and form molecules or break apart molecules. copper and when they're in the same column they have similar effects, similar type of actions. So copper is the most the, the lighter element and then Silver is a heavier element than copper and on top of that than is gold. So not only are copper and silver anti-microbial, gold is in essence impervious to microbes and can be used for example in dental work, Preventing microbes from infesting cavities and you know infecting teeth. at the same time What's also interesting is that these three metals in that series document the history of metallurgy and weapons. so in Roman times weapons were often made out of copper and the coins were copper and then coins later on you know became more silver and then and then you know gold economy now is more based on gold as a backup currency. So. Even the metallurgy became the alloys became more complex over time using heavier and heavier metals to make things like modern day stainless steel with traces of chromium and nickel and so on. So it's just a fascinating thing if you look at the table of elements it it actually tells a story. So I might sound like a geek for saying that but that's the truth. 

Jason Van Tatenhove: [00:31:35] That's why I love you because I can pick your brain on this stuff and find new things to go research. So the copper real quick. You said you can do like ionic silver but with copper could I do that with like a SilverLung system by just finding copper rods or copper coin. 

Mike Adams: [00:31:50] Yes absolutely. You can you can just replace silver with copper run the same system. Now your parts per million is going to be different because it's going to ionize more quickly, the ionization potential of copper is lower than silver typically depending on what molecule it's in. but play with it you know use use the measurement that you have you know you can shine a red laser through it you can look at the visual aspects of the solution. To give you an indicator but but yeah basically they're interchangeable. 

Jason Van Tatenhove: [00:32:17] Well I'm going to start looking into that quite a bit. 

Mike Adams: [00:32:21] Yeah yeah it's great. I think in a collapse, I think that copper and silver solutions for treating infections are going to be huge. I think it's going to be revolutionary for for the knowledge of copper and silver for in this context. because you know antibiotics are going to be very very hard to get. They're going to run out and most of the antibiotics that are manufactured today are synthesised in laboratories in places like India and Puerto Rico. and in a collapse you're not going to be able to get those shipments in. So they're going to run out. But what do we have in America. We have copper we have silver. If you have silver coins you can make medicine. you know you have to know how to hook up the electrodes and create a potential across a distilled water. Obviously you've got to be able to distill water so it's good to have something like it like a waterwise distiller that can use heat and create distilled water out of you know well water or something. But if you can make distilled water and you have silver coins you can make medicine. It's amazing. You still there. 

Jason Van Tatenhove: [00:33:24] Well you know I'm going to be actually putting on a demonstration in our CPT or community preparedness team local meeting here tomorrow actually. And so folks if you're listening you want to see how you actually produce something like ionic silver, I'll be putting that video up in the next couple of weeks so. 

Mike Adams: [00:33:41] Right on right on. And don't forget that you can treat bandages with this. Let me let me share something. it's super super valuable for everybody. You can take bandages like wound dressing, you know cotton gauze that kind of thing you can soak it in a colloidal silver solution and then dry it out. and then you know it's obviously not going to be sanitary at that point you're going to have bacteria in it from the drying process. But it's going to be impregnated with the silver. So what you can do at that point is you can pasteurize it yourself and create a sterile silver infused wound bandage yourself at home. And 

Jason Van Tatenhove: [00:34:21] how do you pasteurize, just with the silver itself. 

Mike Adams: [00:34:24] no no with heat. You just pasteurize with heat. you can you can heat it to an appropriate temperature. You can look it up online right now in it for a certain amount of time at a certain temperature that will kill any bacteria you can. You can steam treat it. That also kills the bacteria. And but the point is that if you soak it in colloidal silver and then dry it the silver stays impregnated in it. Now you have a silver infused wound bandage that is better than anything the military is using today. Just so you know. 

Jason Van Tatenhove: [00:34:52] That's good to know to look into that. I do have an old autoclave here. And if you don't have an autoclave if you actually use use a pressure cooker the same way, it works the same way as an autoclave does. 

Mike Adams: [00:35:02] Yeah. Autoclaves I should have mentioned that that's the solution. Just just autoclave it. You're done. It's perfect. So you mean also think about this in a post-collapse scenario if you need a business to run you need something that you can barter. How freaking valuable would it be to be able to barter silver infuse wound bandages that have been autoclaved and you know they're sterile and they're infused with silver. That would be incredibly valuable. 

Jason Van Tatenhove: [00:35:30] Yeah I think imma have to put together a whole barter kit for that you're full of great ideas. All right. 

Mike Adams: [00:35:36] Great. All right. Well what else you want to talk about. 

Jason Van Tatenhove: [00:35:39] Well you know Mike is there anything else you want to touch on as far as the winter prepping goes. Think we hit a good good number of topics for that. 

Mike Adams: [00:35:50] I think we covered a lot. A lot of ground there. Just make sure that you can survive without winter heat in case something happens you know. make sure you have appropriate cold weather sleeping bags and all that kind of thing so you could you could camp inside your home if you had to. 

Jason Van Tatenhove: [00:36:08] Right. Well OK well end that part of the interview right there. So let's go ahead and maybe talk about a current event. you want to talk about the ISIS thing and maybe the propaganda around it. What do you what do you want to do are. you want to talk about the we didn't talk about that story you just talked about on Drudge. 

Mike Adams: [00:36:25] Well it's hard to know where to begin. I just every day I wake up and I'm more and more convinced that President Obama is actually working with ISIS that he wants America to be overrun and invaded and destroyed. You know ISIS hates the West and so does Obama and so do all these liberal media people and journalists who hate America. they hate the founders they hate they hate the Constitution. It's sick it's sick that we see this out there now. It's absolutely sickening and that our own president won't even. think about it. He says that that gun owners in America are the greatest threat but but not ISIS, like ISIS is our friend. But veterans are the danger. Give me a break. I don't even know that I can talk about this that much. I just I get so emotional about it. 

Jason Van Tatenhove: [00:37:16] Let me ask you let me ask you this is that is a case if we find that the president really is kind of his own sleeper cell it seems and that is based on his actions. What can we do about it. It seems like the Congress won't impeach. No one will impeach. No one will hold him accountable. He's disregarding the legal system and moving forward with his own set of laws in his own way of making them. So what can you and I do really to put a stop to this. How can we recall this century. 

Mike Adams: [00:37:46] The system is paralyzed. The Republican establishment nothing but cowards and other exceptions to that like Ted Cruz you know I said some good things and Donald Trump seems to have backbone on many issues. So there are there are certain individuals like that. You know Ted Cruz probably would be the most qualified president we could have right now. But the system is paralyzed. The system is broken. I think on a personal note. The best thing we can all do right now is prepare and wait. because there will will be there will be a day that we probably have to take action to defend America, to restore America, to to defend the Constitution. that that day is probably coming in it might be nation wide attacks by ISIS. And you might have to defend your local community or local families or you might have to partner up with your local sheriff's deputies and defend your community. Who knows that day is coming. Right now. 

Mike Adams: [00:38:46] You know it is useless to march on Washington right now. And what's the point. You know there's not enough to make that much of a difference in the country's full of insane people. In a look at the college campuses they're all insane and insane communists. They're actual commies now running the colleges. so I think right now prepare and wait. Boost up your skills, boost up your immune system, you know learn all these things and we just talked about colloidal silver. You know get more precious metals and you know educate yourself learn. Be informed, watch videos, practice skills, learn how to live in the country, learn how to live off the grid, be more self-reliant, collect rainwater, grow your food. I mean and then if nothing bad happens you're still awesome because you're growing your own food and living in the country and living the good life so that's my advice. 

Jason Van Tatenhove: [00:39:35] And folks you know one great way to start learning those skills and start playing to community around you for this type of interaction is through our CPT program which is the community preparedness teams. You know check out the CPT teams in your area you get get information on our website oath keepers dot org, under. We have a whole section of CPT with videos and how to's, and instructional manuals. so go check it out join oath keepers get involved plug in and start training getting ready. 

Mike Adams: [00:40:02] So good advice good advice and hey what if you don't mind me inserting this point on a radio show that I'm running soon. My topic is why. When it hits the fan I'm siding with local law enforcement. I think and I live in the country so I hope I've got good sheriffs out here. I'm not talking about like corrupt city PDs. but out in the country we've got to remember that law enforcement will need your help to keep your community safe no matter what comes down, whether it's you know drug gangs coming up from Mexico across the border or ISIS or who knows what. You know invading foreign troops for all we know. whatever it is you need to to be able to work with your community to create security for your community. I'm talking about blocking the roads, covering the bridges. Short range long range you know providing ammunition providing hardware to law enforcement if they need it if they're working with you if they're constitutional. Let me say that if they're constitutional. Work with them. But if they're trying to confiscate your guns and take away your rights that's a different story. I'm not even going to talk about that. I'm talking about constitutional you know sheriffs and law enforcement that want to provide safe communities. We've got to be on their side in my opinion. 

Jason Van Tatenhove: [00:41:21] Absolutely. All right well I think that great. Just do some quick wrap up here. OK folks it's been Mike Adams with us the Health Ranger. Mike let our listeners know where they can check out your work naturalnews.com, what projects you got going on right now. Where people get more plugged into what you're doing. 

Mike Adams: [00:41:42] Well number one we built a search engine that focuses entirely on the alternative media and that's good gopher dot.com. gopher's just like it sounds GOP H E R go to good gopher dot com search for anything there. You're going to get no B.S. from the mainstream media, no government propaganda, just independent alternative media. Second thing you can do is you can watch headlines all day long at alternative News.com. That's a news aggregation site that we built. The third thing. This is awesome you going love this, fetch dot news is also a topic focused News aggregation site that monitors topics from across the entire independent media but focus on the topics that you want including government agencies. So we have a way to monitor all the news about the FBI, The FDA, FEMA, the NSA, and the TSA and so on, but also topics like survival and liberty and vitamin D immunity. All those things, about 200 different topics you can check that out at. Fetch dot news and these are all systems that I built. While I should say I designed them, I designed the data structure but I had teams build them and these. This is all about empowering the independent media to reach people even even if they try to ban our sites or ban our speech. We're going to have options like these Web sites I just mentioned. So if Google bans you know oath keepers Web sites it doesn't matter. if people go to good gopher dot com because we're going to feature those Web sites. or fetch dot news we're going to carry the news. So we have to build the alternative internet. And this is this is one of the steps that I'm doing to try to contribute to that effort. 

Jason Van Tatenhove: [00:43:22] Now can people who are listening to have their own alternative news Web sites and radio shows and when and how can they plug into that. 

Mike Adams: [00:43:28] Well they can submit their site at good gopher dot com and then will start spidering them. and then everything that you post on your website if it's a news item it will be carried, it'll be a syndicated automatically across all of the fetch dot news aggregation monitoring sites. So this is this is huge, this is you know free of charge there's no fee to do this. If you run an alternative news Web site get it posted on good gopher dot com. You should see it come up live in the searches within a few days and then you start seeing your stories coming up on the fetch that dot news websites as well. 

Jason Van Tatenhove: [00:44:02] Very cool. All right well are we able to talk about the dot news program you do. Is that something that's more behind the scenes. 

Mike Adams: [00:44:09] Oh yeah we we can talk about that again. So we've been inviting a lot of a lot of authors especially those that are liberty oriented to join us and have a website with us on our network. We we purchased about 500 of the dot news domains and we've got some great ones. We've got a guy running right now guns dot news, liberty dot news, freedom dot news, national security dot news, and a lot of other sites to focus on more popular topics like we have we have stupid dot news just to highlight things that the liberals are doing these days. That's really funny. We have cyber war dot news and many others. But anyway people can join us and they can. We'll set up the site for them. They can write for us. They earn the ad revenue from all the pages and we run the whole system for them including the search engine indexing and the syndication all that. So if they're interested in joining us and that. They can they can contact me through natural news and. 

Jason Van Tatenhove: [00:45:08] I'll say that I'm a part of that as well. I've just launched resist dot news this last week. it's been putting up articles every day. And folks check it out. Resist dot news. 

Mike Adams: [00:45:18] Right on. I'm looking at resist that news metrics right now and that just last a few days you're right. 

Jason Van Tatenhove: [00:45:26] Three days I think it's been like that. 

Mike Adams: [00:45:27] OK. So today today so far we're only like. Two thirds of the way through the day. Resist dot news has 800 visitors. Not a lot but it just launched some of the other Web sites. 

Jason Van Tatenhove: [00:45:40] For being Three days old. That's amazing. 

Mike Adams: [00:45:42] Yeah yeah yeah. It's because of our syndication and our social media strategy. The freedom dot news today has over 4000 visitors and every day across these sites we are now averaging between 50 and 100000 visitors and a month ago that was only between 10 and 30000 visitors so we've tripled our reach in one month across all of these news domains. And it is, the system is working like gangbusters. We're getting readers, we're getting attention, we're getting syndication and it is all 100 percent liberty oriented. I actually did a recording welcoming new people to the program. maybe you even heard it yourself it says if you're anti-Second Amendment you're not welcome here. You can't use our technology unless you support the Second Amendment period. So you know I'm taking a stand and I'm sticking with it. You know if you're if you hate America you're not going to work with me. Forget it. You go find somebody else that wants to work with you. But if you love America I welcome you. 

Jason Van Tatenhove: [00:46:45] That's the way to do it my friend. I'm honored to be part of it. 

Mike Adams: [00:46:48] We're honored to have you on Jason and anyone else who wants to join us. We're working our butts off here to try to make it make you know make this work and protect America from what's coming. It's coming down. 

Jason Van Tatenhove: [00:47:02] That is all right. Well we'll end things up there. Thanks for joining us and we'll talk with you again soon Mike. 

Mike Adams: [00:47:07] All right thank you Jason appreciate the opportunity to speak with your audience there.

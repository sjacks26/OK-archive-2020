## Jason Van Tatenhove; LaVoy Finicum

JVT: Important story to get out. Many of you were at Bundy Ranch, were very inspired by the actions that happened there. It was the first time in our country’s recent history that good Americans stood up and said we’re not gonna let this happen on our watch. We’re not gonna let the BLM go in there and massacre these people. We went and stood shoulder to shoulder with some of the best Americans in the country. Whether it’s militia, OK, III%ers, cowboys, ranchers in the area, friends of the family, we all went out and said no, we’re not gonna let this happen. (0:00:58.6)

JVT: Guess what. We won that battle. But it’s really not over. There’s still a lot going on. We have a new story coming to us out of Arizona. We heard about this rancher. Last week, LaVoy Finicum, he was at Bundy Ranch, he was one of the guys on the horses, one of these brave ranchers that stood with Bundy and his family and said no, not gonna do it, not gonna let this happen. Now, he’s got his own situation happening. He’s been a rancher for a long time, his family roots go way back in the county that he’s in. And he’s taking a stand. Much like Cliven Bundy, he feels that the BLM is an unconstitutional group, this goes all the way back to the Sagebrush Rebellion of the 70s. It continues today, we see it with miners, ranchers, ATV outdoor enthusiasts. We see our rights infringed upon by an out of control federal agency, making up laws as they go in an unconstitutional way. (0:02:15.0)

JVT: LaVoy said I’m not gonna continue to pay these grazing fees that I feel are unconstitutional and wrong. He’s never not paid them, he actually has a really good relationship with the BLM, or has until now. He’s been paying everything on time. He wants to continue to pay for his cattle to graze, but not to the BLM, to the county government as a production tax. He feels this is more in line with the sovereignty of his state, and that he needs to take a stand. He was impacted by Bundy Ranch and feels it’s now his turn to take a stand. (0:03:05.7)

JVT: There’s another rancher out of Utah that is doing the same thing. Now we’re seeing the sparks of this rebellion starting to catch fire. There are some awesome things coming our way. We need to stand with these guys, we need to get the word out, do our part in this info war to tell the stories about these people standing up and making a difference. Share this video, tell your friends and family, share it on Facebook. Help us get the word out about a true patriot doing his part to help save our country.

JF: (0:03:53.9) I’m a rancher on the Arizona strip, northern Arizona. I’ve been ranching out here for about 6 years. My grandfather homesteaded out here a few generations back on my mom’s side. My roots run pretty deep in this area, I like it quite a bit.

JVT: You were at Bundy Ranch. Tell us about your experience there.

JF: (0:04:43.2) Cliven is a neighbor, he’s just across the border on the Nevada side. I’ve known him longer than he’s known me. I knew he was fighting with the BLM and I was wondering if he would stand, if he would have the nerve to stand when the real pressure came. When it did, I asked a mutual friend, is Cliven gonna stand? And he said I’ve never known Cliven to back down from anything. I said what are we gonna do? We both ended up there as cowboys, we road that day. It was a great day to see a fellow rancher and neighbor stand up and prevail. (0:05:53.4) That’s how I know Cliven, and we’ve been good friends ever since. He’s been a great encourager to me. His effort is not about cows and grass. His effort has been about freedom and the Constitution.

JVT: (0:06:13.1) Tell us about your situation. You’re having some issues with the FBI and BLM.

JF: After I road with Cliven and his family, I had to do some soul-searching. I learned a lot. I always knew the BLM was overreaching. But when I was there, I came to understand the principles on which they were standing, that part of the Constitution that forbids the federal government from owning vast amounts of land. I knew he was standing on a constitutionally sound principle. When I came back home, I had an internal dilemma. If Cliven was true and I believed it, what was I doing paying grazing fees to the federal government and upholding an illegal entity and giving them power with my actions (0:07:25.7). In order to be consistent, I had to either sit down and be quiet and let them rule, or I had to make a stand. I finally did that. I sent a letter to the solicitor-general in DC, just 1 paragraph saying I’m cancelling all contracts between me and the BLM. That’s caused quite a stir.

JVT: (0:07:57.7) Tell us what a grazing fee is and under what authority they claim to be collecting them.

JF: This is very important. It’s important to understand that these are grazing rights. A grazing right is a property right, just like a car or a home. Grazing rights are personal property rights. They were established from natural law. When pioneer ancestors came out here, they would bring a herd of sheep or cows, find a spring or make a reservoir. They started grazing this land. Out here on the Strip, they never pushed off any Indians, the grass was not being used. (0:09:00.5) By preemptive rights, being the first one there, they began to establish a property right on the land. We all know about lines, we stand at lines in the grocery store, the movie theaters, at the DMV. When you stand in line, you begin to establish a right. When you’re first in line, you establish a right, we see that as self-evident. As long as you stay there. There’s 3 things to create a property right. You must claim it, use it, and defend it. When you’re first in line, you’re claiming it. Then you must use it, you can’t leave the line, go get a hamburger and come back and say I want my place in line. The third is you must defend it. If a big guy says this line is way too long, I’m gonna cut in front, you can either step back and mumble and grumble and do nothing, and in doing so you’ve given up your rights. Or you can defend your right. You can ask the people in the back in the line, call for help, or defend it and say no I’m not gonna let you cut in. (0:10:23.9) Those three things created these grazing rights. They were the first there, they had continuous and beneficial use, and they needed to defend it. This is what Cliven was doing. His ancestors were there, he’s always had continuous and beneficial use, and when the BLM tried to push him off he defended it. (0:10:42.1) That’s what a grazing right is. In 1935, the BLM came in and passed the Taylor Grazing Act. They swooped up all the grazing rights in that act and said these are now ours, we’ll permit you to graze upon the land and you’ll pay a grazing fee for it. In one fell swoop, they gathered up all the rights and returned them to ranchers as a permit.

JVT: (0:11:11.5) They just disregarded all of those rights.

JF: Exactly

JVT: And took it.

JF: Natural law.

JVT: Was there much outcry or resistance at the time?

JF: No, because government comes in very softly. They offer to help, we can run in ten miles of water line for you. You say yeah, I don’t have the machinery, I can’t do that. They started this partnership of private and government working. You’ve heard that saying, we’re from the government and we’re here to help you. Not by being vigilant and standing upon freedom, we begin to give it up. They came in very softly, weren’t oppressive. But you know how it goes, they start putting more control and restraints upon it until they put out a lot of ranchers. (0:12:06.2) They put out all the ranchers on public land from Cliven to the coast.

JVT: Many families have been pushed off their ability to ranch out in the West. Cliven and you are a few of the ones remaining, right?

JF: In Nevada, in Clark County, he’s the last one of like 54 ranchers. He’s been a buffer. It’s traveled from the West Coast, coming inland. When they hit him, he’s fought the BLM for 20 years. We’re on the back side of him, I’ve had nothing but good relationships with the BLM. Never been contrary with them, never had a trespassing, just a good relationship. I’m not taking this stand because I’m being oppressed (0:13:01.5) because they’re trying to force me off. It’d be a lot cheaper for me to not take this stand, and a whole lot less headache. This is about the Constitution. When you got into Article 1 Section 8 Clause 17, the Constitution lays out how much land the federal government can own and control. Our Founding Fathers wanted us to keep freedom, so they specifically defined what lands a central power could hold. In that article, it explains that they can only get the lands if they purchase the land from a state legislature and it can only be for military purposes and other needful buildings. They can only own and control that land for the defense of our nation. (0:13:55.2) Plus the 10 square miles of DC. The third place the federal government can control land is the territories. We’re not territories. If you look at a map, the BLM has almost no control over land back East, but as you move further West that the landmass begins to grow.

JVT: They own the majority of it out here.

LF: They own 96% of Nevada, 70 some percent of Arizona, 80 some percent of Utah. There’s a great deal of wealth out here, more than people realize. As governments want to do, they want to increase control and power. Pretty soon they were slower and slower at disposing of the land to the states. (0:14:45.7) That land was supposed to be disposed to the states upon statehood. The states were to come into the union on equal footing. But after Ohio, they became pretty slow until they said this land is ours, we’re holding it. That’s what they’ve done.

LF: People ask why that’s so bad. This is a very important reason. To keep freedom, the Founding Fathers divided power, the 3 branches. On BLM land, do you know how much land the federal government owns?

LVT: I don’t.

LF: I like to help people get a handle on it. I ask do you think they own more or less than the country of Germany. Probably more. You gotta throw in France, Spain, Italy, Portugal, England, and you have roughly the size of this landmass that the federal government owns and controls. On that land, they’ve combined the 3 branches. On these lands, they say we have complete legislative power. A bureaucrat behind a desk will write a statute that has the force of law. (0:16:24.0) They enforce this statute by force of arms. They empower federal rangers to enforce this law, armed and authorized to use lethal force if necessary, you saw that at Bundy. 

LVT: Oh yeah, I’ve had guns pointed at me, you too. (0:16:42.2)

LF: Back in 2002, the Dann sisters in northern Nevada, they were successful in taking out them. They had agents and rangers and choppers, not quite so much as Bundy, but they were successful in crushing them. In other words, they’ll pass a law and enforce it by the rangers. If you get contrary, you go into a federal court. None of these people that rule over us do we elect. None of them are under the power of recall. They’ve combined all 3 branches of power, this without representation (0:17:24.8). That’s why it’s so bad. It strikes at the heart of the Constitution. It’s contrary to the intent and the letter of the Constitution, it’s repugnant to it. That’s what I’m standing on. I’m standing to uphold and restore the Constitution and push back the federal government to the confines of law that We the People put upon it. They are completely running wild. They have no restraints. They are interwoven to every aspect of our lives. If I was a doctor, I’d open up an Obama free clinic and make a stand there. I’m not, I’m a rancher. I can stand here and make a difference. (0:18:15.1) The states should have stood up to the federal government when they were overreaching. We’re also fighting for the tenth amendment, as well as this article and clause. The states, when the federal government began to exceed its lawful limits, should have pushed back. When the states and counties failed to interpose themselves between the people and overreaching government, the last resort is the people themselves. We passed that point of no return where the federal government might restrain itself, the Supreme Court might restrain itself, the states are not going to force the federal government back in its confines. Now it’s down to individual Americans.

JVT: (0:19:07.4) The states and counties are too much in the pocket of the feds. A lot of their money is contingent upon them playing nicely with them. It’s an issue. We’ve seen this since the Sagebrush Rebellion in the 70s. They’ve been pushing ever since then, probably before then.

LF: (0:19:27.0) I believe in government, we need the federal government, we need them to protect our country, our borders, and to make sure that commerce stays regular between the states. Unfortunately, they’re not protecting the borders, and they’re doing a bad job of protecting our country. Plus, the Commerce Clause wasn’t to regulate every aspect of commerce, it’s just to keep commerce regular among the states. The things they’re responsible to do, they’re falling down on. They’ve chosen to get involved in every other nook and cranny of our lives. Let me explain how the money works, how they buy off other politicians. (0:20:11.5) I go to my county sheriff, I acknowledge him as the legitimate law enforcement. I’m upholding government. I go to him and say in lieu of a grazing tax, I’m going to pay a production tax to the county. I’d like you to protect me, my life and my liberty and my property from the federal government. He said the head of BLM law enforcement and the FBI agent’s already been here, sitting where you are, wanting to be deputized. The feds are learning from the Bundy standoff. They didn’t ask to be deputized when they took on the Bundys. Now they’re trying to cover everything by going to the sheriff to get deputized so they can have more legitimacy as they move against me. Thank goodness the sheriff said no and I don’t want you pointing guns at anybody. And he said to me, I don’t want you pointing guns back at them. I said thanks sheriff, as long as they’re not pointing guns at me, why would I point guns at them? I’ve never pointed a gun at anybody. Let’s get the history straight, they’re the ones who pointed guns at me. (0:21:34.9) He said I want no violence. I’m good with that. He should actually intervene and tell the federal government to leave.

JVT: Sure he has the power to do that as the ultimate law enforcement representative of the county.

LF: So I’ve been preemptive by going to the sheriff. And I called my county supervisor, I asked him to start a mechanism to receive production tax off my ranch. He said in lieu of grazing views. He said I have to talk to the BLM first. I said why do you need to talk to the federal government in order to receive a county tax. He said I don’t but I like to keep my options open. (0:22:28.4) I got a call back from the brand inspector, he said they asked me to set up a meeting with you Lavoy, where we have the head of Fish and Game, the county commissioner, and the head of the grazing board. Just a low key meeting. I said sure. The morning before, Cliven called me and said you should have a few other ranchers there. I thought yeah, I’m glad he told me that, I’m kind of naïve and slow to pick up on things. (0:23:16.3) So I had some good ranching families come. Cliven came up too, but he missed most of the meeting. In this meeting, very interesting. We had to move over to the courthouse and use the actual court room, it was the only room big enough. We happened to have some state representatives from Arizona, Rachel [Regina] Cobb, deputy treasurer, and others who were there on unrelated issues but wanted to sit in on the meeting when they heard about it. We want to know what’s going on. I took an hour to teach all these state reps what a grazing right was. They were very receptive, it helped turned the tide on what they wanted to do in the meeting (0:24:16.0). They were hoping to get me by myself and put pressure on me. After I taught the state officials about grazing rights, then it was their turn. The county commissioner started and said Mr. Finicum you gotta stop, if you do what you’re doing, the federal government will take away our pelt. Pelt stands for payment in lieu of taxes. The federal government says I know we’ve taken all the land and the states would get money off this if you had control over it. Grazing and mineral would go to you. So we’ll give you payment in lieu of taxes. So the money flows the wrong way, from the federal government to these politicians, who get to dole it out as part of the budget. (0:25:23.9) So the county supervisor said they’ll take away our Pelt. So I asked the head of Fish and Game, have the FBI and BLM contacted you before this meeting? He said yes. I turned to the county commissioner, have the FBI and head of BLM law enforcement contacted you? He said yes. (0:25:50.4) Of course, I’m the county supervisor. In other words, they’re setting in motion a plan, I already knew they had a plan from inside tips and they were beginning to execute it. The first thing, they promised the county sheriff they wouldn’t have a physical confrontation, they’d just take me out administratively. But you can’t take cows out administratively, you gotta round em up. You can’t round them up with pencils and paper. (0:26:25.4) So the county commissioner puts pressure on me, we’ll lose our federal money. Then Fish and Game said I have to stop because the federal government will take our hunting off the Strip. The Strip is world renowned for mule deer hunting. Head of the grazing board said you gotta stop because the federal government will take everyone’s grazing rights and all the ranchers will lose their ranches. (0:26:50.0) This is exactly what I’m standing against. You’re all bowing down before the threats of federal government. This is tyranny. Here a federal power, people we do not elect, all putting pressure on everyone to get me to bow down and comply. (0:27:27.8) To make sure I get back in line. Now what’s happening is you have a rancher in Nevada out of line, you have a rancher in Arizona (myself) who’s out of line, now there are some ranchers up in Utah getting out of line. To keep control of this land, they have to put us down. It’s worrying them. I told the head of fish and game, this is Arizona, they will not take the hunting. Arizonans will rise up and make sure of that. I told the county commissioner, you need to let out some mining permits. The richest uranium in the world is out here on the Strip and it’s very environmentally friendly. (0:28:23.7) You go down in a small hole, get it out, cover it up, you can’t even tell there was a mine there. The tax revenue that would flow and the jobs, you wouldn’t have to worry about the handouts from the federal government. We would be free, independent. He can’t get that through his head. He’s so attached to the government tit, he can’t let it go. He likes that money flowing that way, he can dole it out to where he thinks it should go. The money should come the other way, working out here, paying our fair share of the taxes, supporting the county governments, you can even send some to the state of Arizona. We don’t need the federal government to be prosperous. They’re holding us down. (0:29:06.8) The head of the grazing board said they’ll take all our ranches and label you a rebellious rancher. What happens if I’m working on my trails, they say you can’t do that, we’re designating you as a rebellious rancher. You can’t ranch here anymore. You see all these heads trembling in fear of the federal government. (0:29:29.2) I’m saying stop, grow a backbone, stand up, quit this. This is why I’m doing what I’m doing. Not because I’m oppressed, but because the federal government has shredded the Constitution, it’s running wild. Here I am, a little old rancher, but I can do my part. I can rattle their cage and say go home federal government, get off my ranch, I don’t acknowledge you here, and I’m not gonna pay you a grazing fee, I’m gonna pay a production tax to my county. That letter I sent to the solicitor-general, that shot back so fast, the FBI back to my sheriff. You know they’re paying attention (0:30:14.9), it’s coming across the desk of Loretta Lynch I’m sure. They’re watching very closely. They have a full game plan, I just wish I knew what it was.

JVT: Do you have thoughts about how they might try to rattle you back? Have they started to do anything to you directly?

LF: (0:30:32.9) No, they first tried to apply pressure on the heads of agencies. They did that part. It’s a complete plan, that’s what the sheriff told me. I told the sheriff, all I want to do is be left alone, he said they aren’t going to leave you alone. My other source said they have a plan they’ll implement when they’re ready.

JVT: I saw a video about something happening with your water reservoir. Was that associated with this?

LF: I need to be careful, it’s important that I don’t accuse where I don’t have facts. (0:31:18.5) I got a tip from somebody who said you better watch your water. I went out and 2 of my main tanks are plugged off. It seems coincidental. I’d like to lay it at the feet of the BLM or their agents or surrogates, but I have no facts. I’ve never had problems. I had to dig down, cut the lines, blow them back out. Looked like they’d dumped something in to plug the lines. I’m very suspicious. I do have both tanks up and running (0:32:04.0).

JVT: Are there any deadlines coming up? Any timeline you have?

LF: I’m current on all my grazing fees, even though I cancelled them I had already paid. I have a big pasture that I’ve never been able to graze in 6 years because I’ve never had water in the reservoir there. Good rains filled up that reservoir, so I can turn some cows in there, 8 weeks early. They gave me a trespass order, said you have 5 days to get your cows off, we’re charging you $1400 or so for what you did. I’m not acknowledging them, I don’t even respond to their threats because I’ve already terminated my contracts. I don’t care what they send to me. At this rate, it will be about $50k within 12 months, just off this. Come October 15, I’m supposed to pay grazing fees, which I’m not going to do. At that point, they’ll give me another trespass. They sent my mandatory terms and conditions, highlighted where I’m supposed to sign. I said I’ve cancelled the contracts, I’m not signing. Federal government, this land isn’t yours. You don’t have any legitimate right to own and control this. (0:33:59.1) I’m not even going to respond to that. They did steal a bunch of my water this summer to fight fires, just drained out a tank. They could have dropped into the Colorado River, but they stole my water. Instead of responding to their demands that I go down there within 5 days, I sent a registered letter, I’m more generous than they are, I gave them 7 days to return 45,000 gallons of water. If it’s not returned, they claimed the other half of this water, I said I’m gonna take the 100% of that water for the next 180 days, that’s how much time it will take for me to get my 45,000 gallons back. I’m turning that whole water onto my range if you don’t return the water in 7 days. That time came and went, so now I’m turning the water into my pasture. 

JVT: If people want to help or keep up to what’s happening, you have a YouTube channel. (0:35:17.7) Where can they get more info? How can they support what you’re doing? Can they make calls to your sheriff or local politicians? Can the people watching that believe in what you’re doing, how can they best help out?

LF: (0:35:31.9) The best thing for the BLM to do is just ignore me and leave it alone. They can’t do that for some reason, they want to make an example of me. Right now, there’s no direct confrontation, so there’s no need for people to come give direct physical support. I’ll try to keep everybody abreast with YouTube. I have a webpage, One Cowboy’s Stand for Freedom, where I keep videos. It’s hard to respond to all the support and requests, but thanks to everybody. I have a couple people that I’ve worked with that are taking point on security. One is Cliven’s personal bodyguard, you might know him.

JVT: Yeah, I know Booda pretty well (0:36:32.4)

LF: Since he’s close and familiar, I’ve known him a year and a half. He’s been gracious enough to be a point man. So you can contact Booda. I also have Coke Reynolds in the White Mountains. You can call or email, I try to respond as fast as I can. I do a lot of speaking at radio shows and stuff to educate people on what I’m doing. This isn’t about cows (0:37:20.2) or grass, or me being persecuted. It’s about us upholding the Constitution and demanding that the federal government returns to the confines of the law. We believe the federal government is out of bounds and needs to return and go back home. 

JVT: I’ve been involved with the Bundy Ranch. I’ve been in Oregon watching these miners, in Montana as well. It seems like there’s a bigger plan at play. I know it’s just speculation, but I believe. You said it earlier, there’s a lot of value throughout the West, mineral rights and grazing rights, timber. I think the endgame is to keep control of that. Do you think that’s what they’re after? (0:38:16.9)

LF: What does an empire need? Land, control. If you’re not a republic, but an empire, you need control. That’s what they’re doing. They’re seizing control of our country. We’ve had an empire rise up that’s unaccountable to us the people. They have complete legislative, executive, judicial power. They rule over us in the West with impunity. The Supreme Court has upheld them. So it’s left to us the individual people to say I’m not going to comply, I’m not going to bow down, I’m not going to bend. Yes, it is about power, control. You control the land, you control the wealth, you control the food, you control the people.

JVT: LaVoy, thanks for taking your stand. I’m proud to have you in our ranks. Keep fighting the good fight. We’ll support you however we can.

LF: Thanks for being there at the Bundys. I knew that you and American citizens were standing behind us. That was a good feeling. I wasn’t armed, most of us cowboys weren’t, but we knew you had our backs. Thanks to all of you who uphold the Constitution.

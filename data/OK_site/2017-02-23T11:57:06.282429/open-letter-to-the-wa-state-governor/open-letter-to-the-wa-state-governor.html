<p><strong>To The WA State Governor From Liberty For All</strong></p>
<p>by Kit Lange – Mar 9, 2015</p>
<p>Governor,</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When you took the office of governor of the State of Washington, you held up your hand and took an oath to uphold the Constitution of our great state.  Included in that is the protection of citizens and their rights.  In short, you took an oath to stand for the liberty secured by the WA State Constitution.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Article I of that document states that “All political power is inherent in the people, and governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed.”  That consent is and always has been contingent upon the willingness of said government to protect and guard the rights of the people, because that is the entire purpose of government.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Currently the state and federal governments are seeking to control and enslave the people through denial of their rights.  You are doing nothing to stop it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Article II of that document reaffirms the Constitution of the United States as the supreme law of the land.  Your oath to uphold the State constitution includes adherence to that statement.  You are not upholding this oath.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Article III of the WA State Constitution states that “No person shall be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.”  Recently a WA state citizen was illegally arrested by the federal government and denied his liberty.  His property was taken from him and has not been returned.  Every single one of his rights secured by both the federal and state constitutions was violated. You have done nothing.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As governor of the state of Washington, it is your duty and your calling to serve the people of this state and protect their rights, whether you agree with their politics or not, whether you like them as people or not.  Anthony Bosworth’s arrest was illegal, as evidenced by the rules being (illegally) changed after his arrest to reflect what the federal government originally arrested him for.  His property was confiscated.  He was kept in a steel cage for hours with no access to an attorney as promised by the Constitution, and interrogated for hours by federal agents, who laughed at his assertion of his rights.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It does not matter what your position is on guns, or whether you like Anthony Bosworth as a person.  His rights were violated, and this happened on your watch.  The Constitutions that you swore to uphold were violated before your very eyes by the federal government, and nothing has been done.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After the peaceful and calm protest of these violations at the federal courthouse in Spokane last week, the Southern Poverty Law Center—which has partnered with the Department of Homeland Security to help decide who’s an “extremist”—wrote an article predicting the arrest of Liberty for All members, including Anthony Bosworth, his wife Maria, Sam Wilson, and myself.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">What is our crime?  The exercise of rights protected—not granted—by the WA State Constitution and that of the United States of America.  The exercise of rights you promised to uphold when you took office.  We dare to speak of liberty, we dare to stand against tyranny, and now we are being threatened with the same fate that Anthony has already undergone once.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We, the patriots of Washington, appeal to you now.  We want no fight.  We want no conflict.  We wish to be left alone in peace, to raise our families and live in liberty.  We ask that you stand with us and stop this violation of our rights, as is your duty.  Under no circumstances do we seek violence, nor will we start violence.  We are not, in any way, “anti-government” as the SPLC claims.  We simply demand that the government adhere to its Constitutional limits, protecting and maintaining the rights of the governed.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Please understand this: We will not comply with these continued infringements.  We will no longer be controlled and have our rights violated.  There is no more compromise.  If an inch of liberty is taken from us, we will take back a mile.  Because of this, we face persecution, arrest, and even death.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">You can stop this from happening.  It is your job to stop this from happening, by upholding your oath to the Constitution.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you do not stand up now, patriots in your state will be arrested by an out of control federal government seeking to quash the liberty movement.  If that happens, there will be a reaction among We the People that will have a ripple effect far outside Washington State.  At that point, you will be complicit in the beginning of a civil war.  That is not something any of us want.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We appeal to you as a father, a husband, as a man who has taken a solemn oath to protect and defend the rights of the people of Washington.  You govern by our consent.  If you would like to keep that consent, then we ask you to stand up for the people you serve.  Regardless of your political position, the people have rights that must be protected.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We await and expect your public reply within 3 days.  If we have not heard from you by that time, we will accept that your position is in agreement with those who wish to criminally enslave the people of Washington State.</p>
<p>Signed,</p>
<p>Kit Lange<br/>
Anthony Bosworth<br/>
Maria Bosworth<br/>
Sam Wilson<br/>
and the patriots of Liberty for All</p>

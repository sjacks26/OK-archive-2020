<p>Remember when everyone decried wholesale Libor manipulation as a crazy conspiracy theory (Zero Hedge: <strong>January 2009</strong>:<em> “<a href="http://zerohedge.blogspot.com/2009/01/this-makes-no-sense-libor-by-bank.html" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://zerohedge.blogspot.com/2009/01/this-makes-no-sense-libor-by-bank.html', 'This Makes No Sense: LIBOR By Bank');" target="_blank">This Makes No Sense: LIBOR By Bank</a>“)</em> because after all, it was impossible for <em><strong>so many people to keep their mouth shut </strong></em>or  whatever the generic justification is for disproving such “conspiracy  theories”? Why, none other than <strong>ICAP chief Michael Spencer says they all  though Libor was “unmanipulable</strong>.”  As it turns out, not only is Libor manipulable(sic), and a vast  rate-rigging “conspiracy theory” is quite  possible when everyone’s  interests are aligned, but it also was massively profitable.</p>
<p>Then it was the turn of the even more massive, multi-trillion FX  market, when first UBS squealed like a pig and soon ratted out every  other bank in the criminal “Cartel” (or was it “Bandits”?) syndicate  (see: “<a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2014-11-07/meet-first-seven-banks-who-rigged-fx-market" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2014-11-07/meet-first-seven-banks-who-rigged-fx-market', 'Meet The (First) Seven Banks Who Rigged The FX Market');" target="_blank">Meet The (First) Seven Banks Who Rigged The FX Market</a>“).  End result: banks such as JPM, Citi and BofA forced to review their  criminal ways and adjusting their third quarter results a month into Q4.  Many more legal fees, charges and settlement coming however for those  who lost money on the other side of such long-running manipulation,  please accept our condolences: you won’t see a penny.</p>
<p>And finally, there was the precious metals market: a market which all  the Keynesian fanatic paper bugs said was immune from manipulation, be  it of the central or commercial bank kind, even with every other market  clearly exposed for perpetual rigging either by hedge funds, by prop  desks, by HFTs, or central banks themselves.</p>
<p>Sadly this too conspiracy theory just was crushed into the reality of  conspiracy fact, when moments ago the FT reported that alongside  admissions of rigging every other market, UBS – always the proverbial  first rat in the coalmine, to mix and match metaphors- <strong>is about to “settle” allegations of gold and silver rigging</strong>. In other words: it admits it had rigged the gold and silver markets, without of course “admitting or denying” it did so.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/428e1400-6804-11e4-bcd5-00144feabdc0.html" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/428e1400-6804-11e4-bcd5-00144feabdc0.html', 'From the FT');" target="_blank">From the FT</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>UBS is to settle allegations of misconduct at its precious metals trading business </strong>alongside a planned agreement between UK and US authorities and seven banks over accusations of foreign exchange market rigging.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>UBS is expected to strike a settlement over alleged trader  misbehaviour at its precious metals desks with at least one authority as  part of a group deal over forex with multiple regulators this week, two  people close to the situation said.<strong> They cautioned that the timing of a precious metals deal could still slip to a date after the forex agreement.</strong></p>
<p>Regulators around the world have alleged that traders at a number of  banks have colluded and shared information about client orders to  manipulate prices in the $5.3tn-a-day forex market. UBS has previously  disclosed that it launched an internal probe of its precious metals  business in addition to its forex investigation. It declined to comment  for this article.</p>
<p><strong>Unlike at other banks, UBS’s precious metals and forex  businesses are closely integrated. The business units have joint  management and the bank’s precious metals staff – who mainly trade gold  and silver – sit on the same floor as the forex traders.</strong></p>
<p>One person familiar with UBS’s internal probe said the bank found a small number of <em><strong>potentially problematic incidents </strong></em>at its precious metals desk.</p>

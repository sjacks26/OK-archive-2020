<p>by James Simpson</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Southern Poverty Law Center, always seeming to hover in the shadows whenever honest citizens and organizations try to stand up for this country, is at it again. In addition to the usual suspects – which includes pretty much anyone who disagrees with the American radical Left – SPLC has been increasingly attacking people and groups who express concern about Islamic terrorism –adding them to SPLC’s infamous “Hate Watch” list.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This now includes the Washington, DC think tank, Center for Security Policy. Widely respected in defense circles, the Center has been warning us for years about the subversive tactics being employed by the Muslim Brotherhood and its proxies to destroy our nation from within. Its veteran analysts from the defense and intelligence community seek to warn the country of the existential threat we now face from Muslim terrorists.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">People all over the world have witnessed the terrorists’ handiwork, and America is now undeniably in the cross hairs. Any organization purporting to defend civil rights would not blame, much less attack, Americans for being alarmed, and would be hard pressed to explain its criticism of the Center for Security Policy.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In fact it is difficult to imagine anyone in their right minds not being alarmed. The chart below uses<a href="http://dailysignal.com/2015/09/10/a-timeline-of-73-islamist-terror-plots-since-911/" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://dailysignal.com/2015/09/10/a-timeline-of-73-islamist-terror-plots-since-911/', ' a list');" target="_blank"><span style="color: #0000ff;"> a list</span></a> compiled by the Heritage Foundation and traces terror plots in the U.S. since 9/11/01. It is easy to see that the trend has been increasing exponentially and in 2015 went off the charts. What will happen in 2016? Already <a href="http://dailysignal.com/2016/02/02/already-3-islamist-terror-plots-attempts-in-us-this-year/" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://dailysignal.com/2016/02/02/already-3-islamist-terror-plots-attempts-in-us-this-year/', '3 terror plots');" target="_blank"><span style="color: #0000ff;">3 terror plots</span></a> have been thwarted and the FBI has <a href="http://nypost.com/2015/11/22/obamas-isis-strategy-only-increases-risk-of-a-us-attack/" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://nypost.com/2015/11/22/obamas-isis-strategy-only-increases-risk-of-a-us-attack/', 'over 900 pending ISIS cases');" target="_blank"><span style="color: #0000ff;">over 900 pending ISIS cases</span></a> in all 50 states. With the attacks in France and America, and the violent Middle East migrant invasion of Europe, how could people not be concerned?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="../wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Timeline.png"><img alt="Timeline" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10115" height="361" src="../wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Timeline.png" width="500"/></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The only true haters are the Islamists and SPLC. Americans do not need to justify their concerns over Islamic terror and its political corollary, the body of Islamic law known as shariah. Indeed, shariah is anathema to every freedom we hold dear and threatens to rob us of it before our very eyes.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If there were no reason to be concerned about Islam, it should be a simple matter for American Muslim leaders to reassure America. But instead, they denounce Americans as Islamophobic and the SPLC turns it into a nationwide vilification campaign. In gambling they call this a “tell.” When your political opponent resorts to name calling, it is because he cannot articulate a credible argument against you. So instead of arguing, he intimidates and attacks.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When an organization as prominent and powerful as the SPLC turns its guns on you, it can cost you your job, your livelihood – even your standing in the community. Not because you have done anything wrong. Not because what they say about you is true, but because a focused vilification campaign forces others to avoid you out of fear. You become what they call “radioactive.”</p>

## Stewart Rhodes; Alex Jones

Stewart Rhodes: [00:00:00] Declaration of 10 orders, we carefully crafted these to tie into American history because if history is repeating itself much of the causes of the revolution are happening again. And also the history of the 20th century with the death camps and mass internment and what we see happening today. It all flows together. So if you want to go down back to the 10 orders or. 

Alex Jones: [00:00:22] Let's do that in the next segment and then you can stay five minutes the next hour that our next guest is coming on I'll invite you back routinely. I know you're a busy guy but you need to talk to Ted Anderson maybe get a Genesis radio show or something you're very very eloquent. When we come back we'll go with the 10 points. but what I like is that you know that huge Paul revolution at first people like oh it went nowhere and I said no it's a delayed explosion like in Force 10 Navarone when they bombed the dam and they're like where is it. It's just it just just sit there smoking a pipe. Just wait a moment and then suddenly it starts breaking. Boom. And now we're seeing that and then people realize they can defeat the enemy in the info war. now they are just blasting or picking up arms in the revolution of the mine. People are taking the red pills. They're waking up and I'm seeing people like you from the Ron Paul campaign and others disperse out to start your own operation. 

Alex Jones: [00:01:09] Riders on the storm ride in the storm folks. Storm of Liberty. Riders. That's. When the enemy comes in like a flood the spirit of the Lord to lift up a standard against it, be part of that standard. To get involved in the info war today. Like. EnList in the Constitution, the Bill of rights, and liberty. Targets of opportunity wake up those in your area. Get the Obama Deception on DVD super high quality. This is the way to have it. Make copies of this, get it out, download it in .divx format at a prison planet dot TV support us or support others. 

Alex Jones: [00:01:51] Let your children play. You give this man a ride. Folks. Don't give this man a ride. Barack Obama the front man of the New World Order and the tip of the spear in their war against humanity. Wake up to them, realize the true depths of their wickedness. Their attack on every basic liberties over the top. I'm sure you heard Sir, Stewart Rhodes with the Oath Keepers Oath Keepers dot blogspot dot com. 

Alex Jones: [00:02:23] But the House has passed the forced conscription of the American people Bill and I am going to have the Army code that the Pentagon has issued saying it will be forced military service I mean the hour is late. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:02:39] Yes it is But that's OK. It's darkest before the dawn and so I think I think I think it's pretty clear that we're going to stand tall. That's why that's why we bumped up our program. we were going to do have a regular site but we saw that things were happening. I called Colonel Hapgood also of the Iowa National Guard and he lied to me like he lied to you. They have a dedicated mail facility 80 miles north of that town they're going to do exercise and he just flat lied to use. So that's one thing that got us. Got us hopping mad and decided to put it up on blogspot first. One thing I do want to say I want to I want to let folks know that I write for swat magazine and I want to make clear that that's a magazine that's you know most people think it's a for a just for law enforcement, it's not. And the gentlemen who run that magazine are dedicated patriots so they're going to give the oath keepers free ad space. I to encourage folks to check out SWAT magazine were my true patriots. So that's my plug for them. 

Alex Jones: [00:03:31] No yeah give out the Web site because. No that's good. We have to take the high ground here. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:03:36] That's right. Yeah you betcha send them. Their mission has always been that's why they asked me to write that column, they used to have Claire Wolfe write it. You know who Claire Wolfe is correct. Yes right. She used to write the enemy at the gate column and she asked me to take it over where she got kind of burned out. But their mission is is to make sure that there's a separation between law enforcement and the people is broken down. they don't believe there should be a separation. And so Rich Lucibella the man that owns Swat that has stood up and dedicated that entire column every month to the mission of defending the Bill of Rights. 

Alex Jones: [00:04:06] Well we knew this would come when the New World Order emerged and admitted everything we've been warning people about. That's why I said even we get laughed at tell people the documents tell them the truth. because when they finally emerge, when they make their big move, which is now happening, then people would have been warned and then they would wake up. But also as the police and military are being twisted in their mission now to carry out globalism, that would be the big wake up call there. I think the enemy trying to program them right now is the is is waking police the and military up faster than even the Patriots. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:04:37] Absolutely and of course Obama is is acting like a complete fool, what he did with the with the veterans and forcing them to take, pay of their own medical care. It's just a huge blunder. It shows the arrogance. 

Alex Jones: [00:04:48] Hubris. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:04:49] Oh yeah. So the anger and outrage. they're blind can't see certain things that are almost autistic in some way. 

Alex Jones: [00:04:56] We're about to break. Only I'm like yeah they're delusional. We're about to break but start with the 10 points. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:05:04] Or 10 points are just what we think are the most likely hot points and trip wires and what we think officers should be considering and soldiers as the lines in the sand they will not cross. Number one is we will not obey any order to disarm the American people. And I like, you know that was the cause of the first American Revolution, that was the final spark. 

Alex Jones: [00:05:25] Lexington and Concord continue number two. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:05:28] Number two we will not be forced to conduct warrantless searches of the American people. There again the writs of assistance, warrantless searches were one of the causes of the American Revolution. And number three is we will not obey orders to detain American citizens as unlawful enemy combatants or subject them to military tribunal. 

Alex Jones: [00:05:43] Stay there. We're going to come back in 70 seconds. 

Alex Jones: [00:05:48] He has spurred so many thoughts, my instincts. You know who our ancestors were everything that I've added quite a bit today. I want to have him back up the next few weeks for a full hour. To talk more about Oath Keepers and take your phone calls to an amazing individual Stewart Rhodes. so many great people that are out there prominently fighting the globalists, we just commend them. run through the other points in the five minutes we have left sir. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:06:12] You betcha. the other ones or are we will not obey orders to impose martial law on a state or a state of emergency on a state. And five is we will not obey orders to invade, subjugate any state that assert its sovereignty. That's think that's kind of a reflection on the initiatives that come out recently where states are standing up and saying we're going to interpose ourselves between the federal government and our own people. 

Alex Jones: [00:06:35] And that was an issue back in the 1770s because they were governors or legislatures and put in puppets. But go ahead. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:06:43] Exactly. And number six is you will not obey any order to block American cities from thus turning them into giant concentration camps. And that was first done in Boston at the time of the American Revolution. Like you just said Boston was put under a military dictatorship with General Gage and then when the fighting started, the people of Boston were told to turn in your guns when you get safe passage out of the city and then turn their guns in and then they were told they could not leave. They were kept there and it was turned into a concentration camp, until and so until the militia showed up and kicked the British out of Boston. So number seven we will not obey any order to force American citizens into any form of detention camps under any pretext. and we cite that history an unfortunate history of the Japanese internment here at home and also the history around the world of Oppressive governments, when they make war on their own people they put them in the camps. In part that's done to the women and children in the camps so that the men who are fighting will turn themselves in on behalf of their children and women. 

Alex Jones: [00:07:39] And the schools public schools admit they've been drilling to grab kids without asking on FEMA buses and then tell parents to report to them. Tyranny does the same thing over and over again continue. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:07:48] Number eight. We will not obey orders to assist or support the use of any foreign troops on U.S. soil against the American people to keep the peace or to maintain control. As you know we've been hearing rumors of this for decades but we're now hearing the same rumors once again from very credible sources that the Obama administration is even considering bringing in foreign troops. 

Alex Jones: [00:08:10] No no no. The agreements have been signed. Toronto Star Canadian Mexican troops to be used, IFOR troops to be used. Those are not rumors. I have hundreds of mainstream articles if you'd like them. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:08:20] Absolutely email them to me. 

Alex Jones: [00:08:22] No no Go ahead. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:08:24] Go ahead. 

Alex Jones: [00:08:25] No no it's just that. No I mean I've had Colonel Craig Roberts and others on who have had like their nephews at West Point and they you know they send in famous generals and tell them we're going to use foreign troops but it's a good thing. So now that is going on. That's not a rumor. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:08:38] Oh I know. I just I just like it. I like to hedge my bets with people. 

Alex Jones: [00:08:42] It's true they're planing it, that the rumor is they may bring him in. I see what you're saying go ahead. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:08:46] Right exactly. We will not obey any orders to confiscate the property the American people including food and other essential supplies. That's number nine. 

Alex Jones: [00:08:53] That's in the public key executive orders they're planning that. So that's public. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:08:58] We will not obey any orders which infringe on the right of the people to free speech, peaceably assemble, and petition their government for redress of grievances. All these are basic, they should be common sense. No no no brainer. But unfortunately as you know you have to remind people of the basics sometimes, we can't take it for granted that someone is going to be thinking about this stuff ahead of time. with Look at Katrina. You know we're hearing now that a lot of that was caused because those Guard troops and those those those officers hadn't thought about it ahead of time and they're kind of caught flat footed. When they were told to go do these things. And so we want them to think about it in advance. And we don't think it's going to go down the same way again. 

Alex Jones: [00:09:35] That's right. Iowa was a gun confiscation drill that's admitted and then they sent out 22 MPs and a colonel to the Alabama shooting and now they're looking at charges of posse Comitatus violation. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:09:45] That's right. That's a good sign. A good sign that they're within the military there still people who are understand the necessary wall of separation between civil and military power and take it serious. So we're very confident. We feel very good about this. One thing I do want to ask your listeners to do. We are going to be doing a tribute video To men who served. And so we'd like to have them send us in photos of those who served when they were young. All the old photos of them and their bodies and who they were and what where they served. E-mail us. We'll put them in our tribute video. 

Alex Jones: [00:10:22] Absolutely. Stay there. I want to sing one last point we get back to how the enemy's going to attack your key operation. Get our next guest on our next guest Up. Stay there for two minutes on the other side, we'll get to our next guest. Stay with us. I'm Alex Jones Infowars.com

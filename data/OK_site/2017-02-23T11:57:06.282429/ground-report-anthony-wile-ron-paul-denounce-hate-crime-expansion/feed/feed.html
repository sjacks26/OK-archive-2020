<content:encoded>Remember the USS Liberty
<p><a href="http://www.gtr5.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.gtr5.com/</a></p>
<p>Is that enough to be placed upon a USA federal government watch list? If not, then my several blogs surely must be enough to strike fear into the hearts and feeble minds of the well-paid lackeys serving their elite-class and corporate masters so very well.</p>

<content:encoded>Hate crime legislation does not flow from the people up. It is actually a crafted means of ensuring compliance by threat of legal injury and has its origins elsewhere. I do not believe that it is actually a product of lawmakers only, though they figure heavily in its implementation as being authorizing agents.<br/>
Proponents of hate crimes legislation are very vocal in institutions of higher learning and the influences from these sources are excessive and difficult to combat. They are extending their influence lower and lower into our community schools and resources.<br/>
Persons subjected to the outcomes of implementation of hate crimes legislation face prosecution and other remedial action, not the least being anger management classes and psychiatric evaluation by order of the court.<br/>
It is just another way of chipping away at our inherent rights, another way of depriving us of them under color of law.<br/>
Once a suffiicient number of persons have been cowed into activity, it shall be over for us for all we once knew as being Americans.<br/>
Major corporattions now routinely have placed throughout their organizations signage stating, ‚ÄúAnxious, depressed, feeling lonely, no one to turn to, we can help you. Call this number.‚Äù Health and wellness !<br/>
We are purposely being made into a dependant people, not hardy or self sufficient. We are being made victims of our insecurities as determined by the ‚Äúprofessionals.‚Äù<br/>
It is a back door to enslavement.

<content:encoded>Is it hate speech to ask where 800 krystrons went? Is it hate speech to say‚Ä¶ if America has debt, cut all foreign aid? Is it hate speech to discuss Rachel Corrie? Is it hate speech to ask why the Rothschild family put so much into Israel‚Äôs supreme court, which has a pyramid with an eye on it‚Äôs roof? Is it hate speech to ask if it was Solomon, David, or Nathaniel Rothschild whom liked the 6 point star so much? It sure does seem that pro-America and anti-semite are becoming a bit too similar. I say cut all foreign aid, exit the UN, IMF, NATO, NAFTA, world bank, etc., quit listening to JEBSON, abolish the federal reserve and IRS, then see whom it is crying the loudest. I have absolutely no problem with Jewish people, nor do I with Islamists, Hindis, Buddhists, Agnostics, Rastafarians, etc., but when asked where one stands with Israel, answering ‚Äúnext to Captain McGonagle and Rachel Corrie‚Äù seems an appropriate response. I guess at the end of the day, I have commented on the Oathkeepers website, I‚Äôm downright fit for Guantanamo bay.

<content:encoded>How does Israel legislate for the United States?<br/>
I suspect that neither Erdan nor his spokesman understand the US Constitution<br/>
I suspect that all ministers and MKs in Israel‚Äôs government are not in agreement with this minister.

<content:encoded>It matters not. What ever one says can and will be called ‚ÄúHate Speech‚Äù by someone. What is fine today is not tomorrow. Take ‚ÄúThe Dukes of Hazzard‚Äù. Taken off the air because of the flag painted on the roof of a car.<br/>
REALLY???<br/>
Any thing anybody says against ‚ÄúThe Government‚Äù is called treason. Of course it is, by THEM!!<br/>
Any people whom are ‚ÄúGOVERNED‚Äù aren‚Äôt as free as they think. We live in a country that has taxes on everything. Don‚Äôt believe me? Case &amp; Point; There IS a sales tax on toilet paper (where I live ) SOOO, you pay a tax to wipe your butt!!! Now how intrusive is that? Blow your nose, pay a tax.Buy a condom, well, you know the rest, pay a tax. What part of your life isn‚Äôt intruded upon?<br/>
Speak up? you are in trouble<br/>
The Main Stream Media demonizes ‚ÄúThose Horrible Gun Owners‚Äù Hate Speech? Of course not, they are mimicking our ‚ÄúGovernment‚Äôs‚Äù view<br/>
Speak out against the atrocities that Israel has committed, and you are Anti-Semetic.(Hate Speech) The thing is, it has NOTHING to do with  Religion!! I‚Äôd be complaining about the COUNTRY!!<br/>
If the people in charge don‚Äôt like it, it‚Äôs labeled hate speech, or treason, or bigotry. Good people don‚Äôt want to be called those things so, they change their speech.<br/>
Good people‚Ä¶‚Ä¶if it walks like a duck, and talks like a duck‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..good grief‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ call it a duck.

What kind of gun owners would shrug that off like it’s no big deal? Original poster text: “With Quisling for the New Norway.”</p></div>
<p>“[S]ome gun owners and gun dealers are also background check proponents,” <strong><a href="http://www.fox5vegas.com/story/30497249/in-2016-nevadans-to-vote-on-stricter-gun-background-checks#.VkRoFJXLM7A.facebook" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.fox5vegas.com/story/30497249/in-2016-nevadans-to-vote-on-stricter-gun-background-checks#.VkRoFJXLM7A.facebook', 'Fox 5 KVVU-TV Las Vegas notes');" target="_blank">Fox 5 KVVU-TV Las Vegas notes</a></strong> in a report on Michael Bloomberg’s bought-and-paid for campaign to end private sales in Nevada. They’ve found two who are happy to go on record siding with out-of-state moneyed elitist interests.</p>
<p>“A lot of people are trying to say we shouldn’t do background checks, they don’t work,” Alex Acree of Fallout Firearms in North Las Vegas gushes. “They absolutely work.”</p>
<p>Yeah, as long as you don’t mind adding little “necessity” identified by the National Institute of Justice, the Department of Justice research arm, in its “<strong><a href="http://www.leg.state.co.us/Clics/Clics2013A/commsumm.nsf/b4a3962433b52fa787256e5f00670a71/c4b73dc817da609e87257b24005ef7f8/$FILE/13SenState0304AttachC.pdf" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'download', 'http://www.leg.state.co.us/Clics/Clics2013A/commsumm.nsf/b4a3962433b52fa787256e5f00670a71/c4b73dc817da609e87257b24005ef7f8/$FILE/13SenState0304AttachC.pdf');" target="_blank">Summary of Select Firearm Violence Prevention Strategies</a></strong>”:</p>
<blockquote><p>Effectiveness depends on the ability to reduce straw purchasing, requiring gun registration…</p></blockquote>
<p>Does anyone really think billionaire Bloomberg is going to invest millions without maximizing his return and advancing toward his goal?</p>
<p>Then there’s Kourosh Haroni, who runs the Rocky Mountain Gun Show at South Point Casino. He’s proud of going above and beyond current Nevada law by forbidding private sales.</p>
<p>“That’s our standards at the Rocky Mountain Gun Show,” he proclaims. “That’s what we believe.”</p>
<p>Having the state coerce people who prefer to keep their rights to themselves into the collective customer pool won’t hurt the bottom line, either.</p>
<p>“This is an excellent look at what we can expect more of as we get closer to the 2016 vote,” Don Turner of <strong><a href="http://nevadansforstategunrights.org/" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://nevadansforstategunrights.org/', 'Nevadans for State Gun Rights');" target="_blank">Nevadans for State Gun Rights</a></strong> observes in an email forwarding the Fox 5 report link to supporters. “Some people that are in the gun business aren’t our friends.</p>
<p>“The TV stations are giving them free publicity, and low information gun owners and gun businesses are giving them free talking points,” Turner notes.  Curiously – or not if you understand how the media works – his group is not even mentioned in the report while <strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140808122728/http:/www.examiner.com/article/trail-shows-nevadans-for-background-checks-a-front-group-for-everytown" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20140808122728/http:/www.examiner.com/article/trail-shows-nevadans-for-background-checks-a-front-group-for-everytown', 'heavily-funded Bloomberg front group');" target="_blank">heavily-funded Bloomberg front group</a></strong>, Nevadans for Background Checks, is.</p>
<p>Turner and his group have been fighting heroically against the disproportionately financed and organized Bloomberg machine, and the media just adds to the pile-on. The elites who think they know best really are out to control the narrative along with our rights. That’s why every Nevada gun owner – every gun owner, really, because once Bloomberg has despoiled the Silver State he’ll roll on to his next objective – ought to already be in the fight.</p>
<p>It makes it especially outrageous, inexcusable and unforgivable to see firearms-related businesses giving aid and comfort to their customers’ enemies, especially by joining in the propaganda campaign. All Nevada gun shops, ranges, trainers, FFLs and gun shows ought to be at the forefront of leading in the defense against Bloomberg, not helping him rack up a victory by steering low information voters his way. It makes it fair to wonder how much motivation is purely opportunistic.</p>
<p>Gun owners deserve to know who is selling them out and who supports them, and to make their decisions on which companies and individuals to patronize accordingly. Why on earth would you do business with someone either staying out of the fray and/or actively undermining your rights, like the craven lairds in “Braveheart,” who let the commoners make all the sacrifices while they profited from abetting tyranny?</p>
<p>There’s <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quisling" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quisling', 'a word for such collaborators');" target="_blank">a word for such collaborators</a></strong>. And that also applies to “sport shooters” who put hobbies over rights.</p>

Caption: Oath Keepers Josephine County Press Conference BLM Corruption – FBI Notified May 5, 2015

JR: I’m Josephine County OK coordinator. I have BM, my assistant coordinator, and ME, the public information officers for OK of Josephine County. OK JOCO has been provided with physical documentation which includes the following information: signed and notarized affidavits regarding missing or destroyed documentation within BLM; email messages from BLM employees mentioning destruction and disposal of documents; email messages from BLM employee mentioning the BLM practice of destroying mines, equipment, and structures; email messages from BLM employees mentioning the use of foam to close up mines, causing miners to dig out the foam and operate the mine again. These documents were presented to use yesterday. They are very substantial. We have the affidavits and a variety of emails. These are directly from BLM employees. This shows a pattern of BLM willfully destroying records, not maintaining records, unable to find records. With the current Sugar Pine Mine issue, this becomes critical because this mine dates back to the 1800s.

JR: (0:01:13.8) So in here, I have an email from a BLM employee. I'm attaching a PDF of a one-stamp mill at the Black Jack Mine, which is part of these mining claims, that I stumbled across in a silvacutlure file. Wish we had more, but I suspect that most of our historic stuff ended up in the "circular file." So in here, with all this documentation, it shows a pattern of BLM willfully destroying records. Now as the Sugar Pine Miners go through their fight with BLM, they have for the last 6 months 14 FOIA requests that have not been answered by BLM. I wonder why. All this documentation was provided to the FBI, and we are hoping the FBI is launching an investigation into the destruction of these records, which prove critical to what the Sugar Pine Mine owners are looking for. They’ve been asking for records, BLM has not provided them records. As their legal battle goes on, here’s the evidence BLM has been destroying those records. 

JR: (0:02:17.3) This is a PDF that we put up on oathkeepersjoco.com. People can access that PDF and all of these records. They can review them for themselves. But it’s pretty substantial. We have a signed affidavit and emails from BLM employees specifically talk about the destruction of records within the BLM.

JR: (0:02:37.3) We also have received documentation related to the Bundy Ranch, where there has been a lawsuit that was successfully won because BLM was obstructing the Freedom of Information Act and not honoring FOIA requests. So as we move down this path and look to the BLM and Jim Whittington, their PIO down there, he is willfully making false statements, false narrative, and lying to the public. They’re also not providing the documentation required by federal law. The question is at what point are our congressional representatives going to hold BLM accountable for their unlawful actions. We’re at a point where we’re no longer talking about the protection of constitutional rights, we’re talking about an agency that is conducting illegal and unlawful actions to cover their missteps. There has to be some accountability here.

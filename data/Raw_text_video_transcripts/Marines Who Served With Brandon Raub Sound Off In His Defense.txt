RC: We’re gonna have 4 Marines that served with Brandon Raub. They’ll introduce themselves then talk a bit about Brandon. Start out with Jesse Cash

JC: I was a sergeant with Brandon, served with him in Iraq and Afghanistan. (0:00:45.8) I’m a college student. My parents have a combined 30 years in mental health. I understand what insanity looks like. My father has been diagnosed with PTSD, I’m well aware, I grew up around it, I know the signs. Brandon has no mental health issues whatsoever. He does not have PTSD. Through the tours, the last 8 years, he’s one of the best men I’ve ever known. He’s one of my personal heroes. 

## JC tells the story of BR saving Afghan lives.

JC: He has probably the biggest heart I’ve ever seen in another man. (0:02:11.0) We’re speaking out because Brandon is being painted as some lunatic on the fringe. That’s not him. He just cares for the American people and believes in America and in freedom. That’s why he’s spoken out. He’s been targeted by the federal government because of his heart, not because of his words. Other people speak about things, go on rap songs and talk about violence and evil and never get picked up. (0:02:57.6)

GP: I was a sergeant in the Marine Corps reserves. I served with BR from 2006 to 2007. I know him outside the Corps, too. We come from the same town. I was in recruit training with him. I know him as a man of integrity (0:03:27.3), honesty, love for country and god. Basically a general love for people. He’s the first person who will take his shirt off his back for someone in need. I’ve never heard him threaten anyone. I trust him with my life. I consider him a dear friend. (0:04:06.5) I’m willing to tell him things I’m not willing to tell most people. I trust him. He’s a down to earth, good person. And he’s highly intelligent.

AD: I’m currently active duty with US Marine Corps, a gunnery sergeant. I need to say that anything I say is not a direct representation of the Corps, it’s my personal opinion. It’s coming from the heart because of the way I got to know BR. (0:04:58.2) We served together in Afghanistan in 2010-2011. I was platoon commander, he was attached to my platoon. We were in a small base in the middle of Afghanistan, all by ourselves. When BR came to my platoon, I immediately took to him. He was very intelligent and mature, articulate. He was different from the rest of the 18-24 year olds. There was an age gap between myself and everyone else of at least 10 years. Because of how he carried himself, we were close. Many days, we spent hours and hours talking (0:06:07.0), really got to know each other well. I got to listen to his views and beliefs and his love for the American people and Constitution, and everything he stood for. (0:06:31.6) I’ve never met someone more devoted as a patriot than BR. His service goes beyond him serving in the Corps. He put his life on the line for the American people and the people of Afghanistan. I can’t fathom that someone with such a big heart. I was there when an Afghan counterpart was blown up and BR with his bravery and heart for people, he knew the danger, he got this guy out of the compound he was in. He takes care of people. For him to be painted as someone with PTSD or psychiatric problems, it’s beyond me, I don’t believe it. (0:08:08.9) I’ve served with combat vets, I know what PTSD looks like. BR is not insane. He does not have PTSD. I’ve never met anyone who loves the American people as much as BR, he really wants people to get back to the Constitution, and he wants the best for this country. (0:08:48.8)

DM: I served with Brandon from 2005 through 2010. BR and I were both E-1 through E-5. He’s never been anyone except a peaceful giant. A friendly caring person. If anything, he cares too much, often for people who don’t care right back. (0:09:31.7) I talked to BR before he deployed to Afghanistan, then he was at my wedding after he got back. He was the same peaceful, fun-loving guy. If you listen to the interview with Brandon from where he’s being detained. When asked what the American people could do for him, he bounced it back and said help themselves, educate themselves. Essentially he’s telling them to look for truth. What is truth, if nothing other than a fact accepted by a plurality of the people. Please remember that in 1492 the plurality of people believed the earth was flat. Christopher Columbus challenged that truth, and here we are in America (0:10:34.1). Prior to the Wright Brothers, people can’t fly. Same thing with space, we’ve done that now. So all he’s doing is calling for people to look for information and don’t have information fed to you by someone trying to push your ideal. Look for information for yourself in multiple places, and piece it together yourself to figure out what you believe. Don’t get force fed information and decide you believe it because someone else does. He was just trying to help people find truth. (0:11:19.7)

RC: There have been some negative comments about BR. Do you guys have anything you’d like to share about that?

JC: We’re talking about Shawn Lawler’s comments. SL was a staff sergeant. We had a terrible group of leadership. We had a platoon commander and gunnery sergeant relieved of command. So a staff sergeant was our platoon commander. A couple days ago, SL posted a comment saying that he thought BR needed help, that the authorities were doing the right thing. SL has not spoken to BR in 5 years. He was with him in 06-07, has not seen him since. He did not know BR then, doesn’t know him now. SL was put into a tough situation, but he got along to get along. He never pushed the envelope, never stood up for his men. He did what he thought was right, but basically was just a yes man (0:13:07.6). BR stands up for the truth and his rights, and did not follow orders if they were wrong. That is contradictory to who SL is. Also, SL is a member of the law enforcement community currently, I believe he’s trying to distance himself from BR for personal or career gain. He doesn’t want to be involved in this, the fact that he was in charge of BR 6 years ago in Iraq. (0:13:45.7) If you know BR, everything that SL was portraying is the complete opposite of the truth. 

AD: I want the American people to know that the mainstream media has only reported on what this one individual has to say. As I try to get my family to raise awareness for BR’s case, I heard well this fellow Marine was worried about him, that he was crazy. It’s interesting how they only run with that piece of information. Out of all the combat vets BR has served with, 99 of them are gonna say what the 4 of us are saying. Why are they only reporting 1 thing that’s negative. I just got through serving with that Marine, doing patrols with him (0:15:05.0). People need to stop being fed, seek truth for yourself. Do your due diligence. That’s what BR did. He’s a great example to the American people.

DM: I saw another story on Fox News of all places, picking up on one comment out of thousands on his wall. The infamous axe comment from BR, which actually is a quote from a rap lyric. Who was that quote pointed at, if that was a threat? If you read his other posts and want to say that he’s crazy or doesn’t make sense, he’s talking about evil in the world, from NWO, Illuminati, banking cartels including the Federal Reserve. If you believe these entities are fictitious, who is he threatening? (0:16:21.4) That contradicts itself. That’d be like me saying I want to punch Mickey Mouse in the face and getting hauled off to jail for it, or to a psychiatric ward.

RC: Greg, could you give us latest news with BR, where he is. 

GP: (0:16:59.0) As far as I know, he’s at a VA center in Salem, Virginia. Jesse, is that correct?

JC: Yes. I was informed today that he is there. They’re not giving out contact info at this time. He is well, he’s being treated well. The family is being careful about how they hand out contact info. He’s been able to speak to a few media outlets including Adam Kokesh. He seems to be in good spirits. If anybody watches his interview, they would come to the conclusion that he’s completely rational. He’s a well-spoken individual.

DM: One of the first things Adam asked him in that interview is are you being medicated. He responded with no. I was under the impression that’s what we do to crazy people, we medicate them, right? If he’s there for 5 days and does this phone interview, but has never been medicated, what’s really going on?

JC: (0:18:40.2) What’s going on is he’s able to have contact with people outside and too many people are watching. I think they’re concerned about that.

RC: That brings up the point of some actions that OK is planning on taking. I’d like to introduce SR. SR, can you expand on any actions our organization is planning on taking?

SR: (0:19:18.8) First, thanks to you Marines for stepping up for a brother. We hope to see this sort of thing happened. Next Saturday, September 1, we’re going to do a rally. We’re hoping to get active duty Marines from Camp Lejeune to come up and join with vets to stand for this Marine, to demand that he be charged or released. I want to remind everyone that, if they could have charged him with a crime, they already would have. The speech, whether it’s song lyrics or things he said, did not rise to the level of a crime. He wasn’t threatening anyone in particular, he wasn’t calling for violence against anyone in particular. What he was doing was protected speech. Folks should keep that in mind. I’ve scoured his Facebook page, nothing on there is unprotected speech which could be considered a crime. (0:20:32.1) He’s not threatening anyone, he’s not calling for violence against a person, place, or thing. That would be the threshold for something to be chargeable. So he’s being held solely for his constitutionally-protected free speech, political speech in particular. I see this as a dangerous precedent for persecuting outspoken patriots, especially veterans. We all know veterans have already been targeted by DHS, they’ve been making noise about how returning veterans are a threat. When you guys are overseas fighting and dying for your country, you’re good to go. Once you come home, they see you as a threat. The reason is a lot of veterans have the courage and integrity to stand up and speak out when they see something wrong. So I guess we are a threat to what they’re trying to do to our country. We’re not a threat to the American people. We want to take a good hard stand. If we allow this Marine to be disappeared without a grand jury indictment, without a charge, just thrown into a cell and detained without due process rights, without the right to confront his accusers and have a jury of his peers determine whether he’s committed a crime. If we allow this to happen, we’re crossing the Rubicon and going down the same path as the Soviet Union. This is how the Soviet Union used to handle dissidents. (0:22:05.0) They would say they’re crazy, they held opinions contrary to the approved Communist Party opinion. They were hauled off to the insane asylum. The Russian people did nothing, they sat on their hands. But we’re not Russians, this is America. We are going to do something. We need to step up. So I challenge everybody who has sworn that oath, whether current serving or veteran, to step up and stand up for this young Marine vet. Unless you take a stand now, you will have to take a stand later. It’s much better to take a stand now, with peaceful protest and assembly, sweat now bleed later. If we let our country go down this path, it will not stop until we stop it. (0:22:58.6) Let’s stop it right now by putting boots on the ground and making it clear that we’re behind him. We’re not afraid to step out. RC went online and found, on one of the Tea Party sites, folks talking about they’re gonna have to start watching what they say online. That’s very sad. The exact opposite is what we have to do. Do not give in to evil but proceed boldly against it. We need to step up and get right in their face. Not with violence but making it very clear that we’re not afraid. Haul us all away, we’re all BR, is my perspective. I’ve said things, I know RC has probably said things that are just as firebrand and angry as anything BR said on his Facebook page. That’s our right. We should be pissed off. We have a bunch of traitorous, treasonous SOBs in Washington, DC who have sold this country down the river. They’re eating it from the inside out. (0:24:04.7) They’re the enemy of the Constitution inside our gates. We need to be pissed off and speak out. By god, the Founders intended us to do that, expected it. We’re gonna call on everybody, whether you’ve served or not, from every branch but especially Marines, to step up and join us on September 1. Let’s get out there. We’re not going to ask for a permit, we’re not going to talk to cops about where we should stand. We’re gonna go there, we’ll be on the sidewalk. As long as you’re on the sidewalk and not blocking traffic, you don’t need a permit, the 1A is our permit. Let’s go guys. Let’s stop up and show BR we have his back. (0:24:56.0)

RC: Thanks SR. I’d like to add, OK ranks are filled with many of the military branches. I think every branch is represented in our org. We have a lot of Marines. This is a fellow Marine. I call upon all of you to make a stand. This is a very important time in the history of the nation. If we allow this to continue, tomorrow or next month it will be another of us, then another. This is a precedent. We can’t let this go unanswered. Let’s get out there and support him. Closing comments guys?

JC: BR is not a Timothy McVeigh. He is backed by hundreds of Marines that know him personally. He is not some fringe outsider, some lunatic. He’s well-spoken, articulate, intelligent, good-hearted. He’s simply doing what he and all of us believe is right, that’s standing up for freedom, freedom of speech. We’re going to continue to back him. We’re not going to go away, we’re not going to be quiet. 

GP: (0:26:57.1) I think it’s important for everyone to recognize that he’s only being detained because he has a leadership quality and because he’s blowing a whistle. He’s calling out what he thinks is the truth, and I happen to agree with him on most things. Somebody doesn’t like it. I’m not going to make references as to who or what. I’m not even sure anybody actually notified the authorities on this. They claim they were notified by several people that he was making threatening posts. I find that hard to believe. I think he was blowing the whistle, they didn’t like it. They saw a lot of people following him. They are detaining him for reasons that are illegal, unconstitutional, blatantly against our Bill of Rights. He’s a good person, a great person. I love him to death. I would trust him with my life. I think this whole thing is a farce, ridiculous. The American people need to stand up and shoot this thing down. (0:28:43.5)

AD: We should all be BR. We should stand up for the Constitution. That’s all that matters.  DM: If anything, BR cares about everyone. He cares about his country and the documents that this country was founded on. Whether you agree with his theories is irrelevant. We have a document that says that he’s allowed to speak his mind on these theories. If you go back to the Founding Fathers and the principles this country was founded upon, these are not rights given to us by government. These are rights given to us by whatever means of creation you believe in. You have these rights just because you are alive, not because someone gave them to you.

RC: Good point. I appreciate you taking the time to talk to us about BR. It’s important this gets out so they understand that the rank-and-file that served with him, how they feel about it. Remember we have the upcoming protest we’re shooting for. Let’s try to rally and get as much support as we can. It’s time government hears the voice of the American people. This will be a good opportunity for us to express it clearly.

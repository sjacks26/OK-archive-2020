## Alex Jones, Stewart Rhodes. Rhodes is on the phone, no video of him, just a still picture when he talks

## I think they’re talking about the DHS report about RWX from 2009; introduce it near the end.

AJ: SR is our guest. Judge Napolitano is gonna be on to talk about the Tea Party. Repubs playing the out of power party right now, acting revolutionary. Obama and his handler Geithner, are playing the part of establishment. It will just switch again in 4-8 years, and back and forth, “sucking generation after generation into greater tyranny.” Or we can realize, “there’s a puppet on the left, a puppet on the right. Wait, it’s one guy holding both puppets.” I wanna talk about how corporate welfare is 30-to-1, but the media makes it all about welfare moms. “I’m against government healthcare because the government is run by a eugenicist.” (0:01:09.5) Nazi Germany had government healthcare, Soviet Union did. OK started a few months ago. SR got upset with the NWO after the Ron Paul campaign ended, “understood that tyranny will come to your door in a uniform.” Saw that we need to get to the police and military to show them how the Constitution is being violated, get them to upload their oath. NWO, “global corporate crime syndicate, this overall planetary system where they can commit their crimes and get away with it” (0:02:19.7). Reports about threats from Christians and gun owners – and reports about threats from environmentalists – were being issued under Bush as well. (0:02:49.3) The government is criminal, hijacked, counterfeit. Biggest threat to this government is returning troops and people buying guns. Perfect timing with first OK meeting on the Lexington Green.

SR: Honored to be back again. (0:03:27.4)

AJ: Give us your take on the media saying that Tea Parties are evil, a bunch of cop killers, and a bunch of right-wingers, when this isn’t about left or right. They’re desperate to divide the American people. Explain what that military tactic is.

SR: I was never a Ranger. I was a long-range reconnaissance scout. Want to make sure no one accuses me of falsifying my records. I jumped out of airplanes until I hit a big tree one night. (0:04:28.9) I was at the Knoxville rally yesterday, was a guest speaker there. Like you said, it isn’t left or right. It’s about totalitarians versus freedom. Need to get back to the basics of our republic, back to core Americanism: Declaration of Independence, Bill of Rights, Constitution, and be consistent. I criticized Bush, I’m getting tired of people saying where were you when Bush was doing this. I was criticizing him publicly. (0:05:24.2). Americans are waking up, realizing left-right paradigm is a false paradigm. This is a bipartisan assault on our rights.

AJ: That worries the system. 2 weeks ago, it was in the newspaper they were gonna run regular Army checkpoints and Air Force MPs in Tennessee. It came out the military with the state police shut down highways and searched vehicles. This was in the news. (0:06:03.6) The military just said they were gonna do it. We gotta make a big deal out of this.

SR: Absolutely. Hitler did the same thing. He destroyed the independence of the provinces, he solidified power at the national level. He made provinces puppets. Every tyrannical government destroys separation of powers between the national government and local government. (0:06:34.9) For our April 19 rally, we’ve added Richard Mack and Guy Cunningham, author of the 29 Palms survey asking Marines if they would fire on Americans resisting gun confiscation. He’s a patriot who was concerned about the troops not understanding the Constitution (0:07:02.3), being conditioned to accept UN command and other things contrary to our Constitution.

AJ: Get us his number, I want to interview him. I’m sending a crew of 2: Aaron Dykes and Rob Dew. You also have a famous Navy Seal captain there, right?

SR: We’re gonna have an oath ceremony to renew our oath on Lexington Green. It’s going to be a historic and emotional experience. We’ve got active duty military and police flying in from around the country. We’ve got high-ranking military officers gonna be there in their dress uniform (0:08:08.5). And also us veterans. We also invite average citizens who have never taken an oath before, want to do it for the first time. I did that yesterday in Knoxville, with a crowd of about 2000 people. The video for that is up on our website. The Lexington Greene is gonna be the first public meeting of the Oath Keepers. The folks in Knoxville didn’t even know who we were. I kinda caught em off guard.

AJ: This is gonna spread like wildfire. We’ve got state police training manuals put out by feds. We’ve got video of police at a warrantless checkpoint, find a pocket Constitution with a woman and flip out and arrest her for it.

SR: I remember seeing that. That’s why we have to stand up. Tip of the spear needs to be the troops and the police, stand up and say we are the constitutionalists. The latest DHS report is just propaganda, labeling returning vets a potential terrorist threat, it’s just amazing.

AJ: It is a secret police commissariat political police report like the Soviet Union or Nazi Germany or Maoist China. Out of the textbook. This report has really upset people. Most police are former military. They’re saying you’re the threat. First thing Hitler did was kill the police and military in the night of the long knives. Explain to folks how big a deal this is.

## Fades out. Continues with part 2.

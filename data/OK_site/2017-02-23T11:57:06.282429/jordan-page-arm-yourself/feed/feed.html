<p>There is nothing to forgive as we are ALL under stress.</p>
<p>Understand to me the US Constitution is NOT theoretical, and it gives us, “We the people” the answer to the problems that we have and it IS the Militia (which is all of us trained).  The problem I see we have is getting people past the “we cannot do anything” stage and that we LAWFULLY in THIS nation can enforce our US Constitution, and the state Constitutions, our elections, protect our borders as the organized(trained) Militia.</p>
<p>The big problem is getting people past the brain washing that the US Constitution does not mean what it says, and that those that serve within our governments ARE not “THE” government.  That THOSE THAT SERVE WITHIN OUR GOVERNMENTS are the criminals, domestic enemies, Traitors, – and when force is is threatened or used – *Terrorists against the American people, the US Constitution, the USA.</p>
<p>That OUR actions, as long as we follow the US Constitution, will be LAWFUL here in OUR nation to remove those who serve within our governments and REPLACE them with those who are going to support and defend the US Constitution as they are REQUIRED to do by the US Constitution, definer of our government, Supreme LAW of our land, and the contract they ALL serve under.</p>
<p>I have had much worse said to me, and because I believe in the US Constitution enough to give my life to see her continue, none of those things can bother me except how to educate those who are stuck within the brainwashing going on.</p>
<p>Apology accepted but not needed. </p>
<p>Stay safe, READ the US Constitution and understand that EVERY word within it has meaning and is LAW.  So when it says “We the People…” it means us, We the People…”,  not those that serve within our governments.  Also remember that it IS all in writing backed by Oaths, and the blood and fortunes of those that freed our nation and created it.</p>

<content:encoded>CAL, I just can’t put away in my mind and heart my reply to you’re above response.  My reply was way too terse and you sure didn’t deserve it from me.  I read just about all your replies to articles and they are right on target in terms of Constitutional fact.  Your reply just caught me at a bad moment and so I hope you will forgive me.  I believe that the theme here was that we all need to arm ourselves in every possible way because times are perilous and have reached the point that we can no longer afford to ignore it.  I believe that the Obama administration, as a whole, is diabolical and has the intention of delivering the final death blows to America.  We get the Constitution, we get nullification, we know we’re in the right, but we had better be able to back that up with force.  So forgive me, my brother.  We stand together.

<content:encoded>I just got a moment to listen to this incredibly talented young patriot as I was at a cookout for oathkeepers this weekend and hadn’t had a chance to listen before that event. The man is right…This is very moving music. I have to admit that it brought tears.<br/>
If anyone knows if there is a CD of this young mans music, I would like to know where I can get several copies to distribute to fellow oathkeepers and patriots. I think it would set a powerful background for any public patriotic events hosted by oathkeepers and any other such groups of constitutionally minded Americans. What do you think Elias…????<br/>
Lets get the word out and lets help this young man share his talents with the rest of America.

<content:encoded>Cal, I think you are living in a theoretical world.  Its kind of like bad guys obeying the ‘gun free’ zones.  Or how about this:  There are no sharks in this swimming area because we have signs declaring ‘No Sharks Allowed’.  Good luck with that.  But if it makes you feel safe, then good for you.

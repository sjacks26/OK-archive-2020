<content:encoded>Hi Steven,<br/>
Thank you for reading here and leaving your comments. In response to issues you have brought up I would like to add just a bit of clarification for all readers.<br/>
First, the article above is an interview with James Jaeger by Anthony Wile of The Daily Bell. It is not an official Oath Keepers article, although James Jaeger promotes the Oath Keepers mission with his latest film, Midnight Ride. James Jaeger was speaking on behalf of his own studio, Matrix Entertainment, and he was not speaking as a policy-maker for Oath Keepers. That’s one thing that should be noted please.
<p>The author of the book which inspired James to make Midnight Ride is Edwin Vieira. Edwin is a member in the NRA and is also an NRA-certified firearm instructor. He joins James in lamenting the fact that the NRA has refused to acknowledge, for many years, the first thirteen words in the 2nd Amendment. Both Edwin and James, and I myself as an associate producer on the film, wanted the NRA to have a representation in the movie, but we could not get any interest from the NRA. Ted Nugent is a lifetime member in Oath Keepers, and is a member of the Board of Directors for NRA, and we tried repeatedly to interest him in representing the NRA in the movie, to no avail.  So James is lamenting the fact that the NRA shows no real interest in the complete meaning of the Second Amendment, or at least not enough interest in it to have a presence for NRA in this movie. That’s a second note we all should bear in mind.<br/>
But thirdly, please understand that not one of us who were involved in making the documentary film Midnight Ride is “attacking” the NRA. We are questioning the NRA’s motive for avoiding the word “Militia”, when the Constitution itself requires it and the 2nd Amendment to that Constitution also says the Militia is “necessary to the security of a free State”. When the duty of the Federal government is clearly spelled out in the Constitution and the Bill of Rights, (the duty to see that the “several States” have their Constitutional Militia), and a gun-rights organization refuses year after year to acknowledge publicly that the Constitution requires the States to have their Militia, what does that say about the gun-rights organization?  It is not an attack on the NRA for refusing to support the Constitution, but instead, James, and Edwin, and actually quite a number of others including myself, are seeking to guide the leadership of the NRA in their thinking, so that they will see the light and do the right thing — which is to remind this berserk government about what the highest law of the land has to say about the government’s duty to make sure the States have their Militia. The NRA should, and could, be educating millions of loyal NRA members about the Militia, yet it remains silent. I for one am glad the NRA is there, but I see no reason not to urge the NRA to consider the whole Second Amendment, instead of just focusing on the last part of that Amendment. I don’t see that as “attacking” the NRA, but as offering grassroots (and Constitutional) guidance.</p>
<p>If, as you noted, “the NRA obviously knows what they are doing….”, then that is an indictment, a confession that they are deliberately refusing to acknowledge what the highest law of the land requires. I prefer to think that they just have not looked deeply enough into the “Original Intent” of the Founders and into the spirit of the written Constitution and Declaration of Independence, and that they should be willing to admit truth when loyal members bring it to them in undebatable presentations such as the works of Edwin Vieira and the documentaries of James Jaeger.</p>
<p>Thank you for reading.<br/>
Salute!<br/>
Elias Alias, editor</p>

<content:encoded>Thanks aebjr for the post. I will look into that myself and see what is available. But the public condemnation of either organization by the other is nothing but detrimental to the cause and the main reason for their very existence now. “The cause” being the preservation of the US Constitution and of this great country and her traditions. I think that the main liberal media does enough public bashing of both organizations and they don’t need any help by fighting between like minded people. Merry Christmas.

 I, like you, am a member of both organizations (along with others), and I do understand your sentiments. However, I am presently trying to access previously available information, connecting the Oath Keepers, and the NRA.The specific information relates to the successful recall of politicians in Colorado.In the NRA periodical (America’s 1st Freedom, November, 2013) printed shortly after the recall. I see the picture of a man(Joseph A. Santoro) proudly wearing an Oath Keeper ball cap on the cover. I have yet to find any formal mention of the Oath Keepers, but I am still reading and researching. I was not encouraged to see the search results (0) for OKs, so far.That was just the NRA-ILA page, but…..

<content:encoded>If you have such an issue with the NRA you should leave. You sound like a backstabber and accusing the NRA of things that they have stood against for decades. I wouldn’t want to be in a fox hole with you.

<content:encoded>I am a member of both the NRA and Oath Keepers and I am proud to be a member of both. I think it is disgraceful that anyone is attacking the NRA because they have chosen not to be in the film and/or to participate with Oath Keepers. Quite frankly, if not for the years of the NRA fighting gun grabbing politicians, your Oath Keepers wouldn’t even exist unless of course you planned on walking around with your BB guns and single shot shotguns. It was the NRA that got the “assault rifle” ban overturned, you know, the ARs you all carry around. I think Oath Keepers should back off and let the NRA do what they do and quite trying to harness them into other areas they chose not to participate in. And for the other poster, if you are a ashamed of the NRA, I’m ashamed of you. The NRA obviously knows what they are doing and they don’t need your advise.

<content:encoded>Why doesn’t the MIA NRA surprise me/? I am a Patron member and at times I am ashamed of the NRA. I have written to them and asked  them to investigate the Sandy Hook Hoax . Because I have looked at all the evidence and am convinced that the Sandy Hook shooting never happened.  BUT the NRA won’t consider even checking it out…that tells me that ‘”a” they are in on the gun confiscation or “b” they are a bunch of cowards and afraid to expose this corrupt administration.

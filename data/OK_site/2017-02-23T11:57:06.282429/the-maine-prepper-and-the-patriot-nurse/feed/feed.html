<content:encoded>This is absolutely true, you need fat in your diet for many reasons including fatty and amino acids, besides, fat is the best part for survival as well, fat is used as storage for nutrition during the “dry” times when food is scarce.
<p>and yes wild game is hard..but not impossible.</p>

<content:encoded>The biggest challenge living off wild game is getting enough fat in your diet so you do not get sick. Just the opposite of modern urban living. I’ve spent the better part of the last two months since I retired out and lost 21 pounds. Rendering fat from an animal and eating liver essential. We have learned that fat in our modern diets is bad which is false.

<content:encoded>I grew up in the country, have skinned, cooked and eaten rabbits, and even ravens/black birds ( they taste nasty, but are still protein)  and have also eaten deer, and wild game turkey is also bad tasting IMO but again, it’s protein.  having land also gives advantage of gardens for vegetables, otherwise there is usually a garden worth in vegetables on most land if you know some basic horticulture. 
<p>and around here, rabbits, snakes and deer are plenty probably won’t stay that way though. </p>
<p>but living off the land is something me and a few friends have done in our youth, up to a week at a time.  never really forget the skills entirely.</p>

<content:encoded>The videos load for me. I use Firefox. The site has been slow today, so you might have to wait a bit for them to load. Patience is a virtue, after all.

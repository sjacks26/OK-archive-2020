<p>by Holly Deyo</p>
<p>While having a nice stash of freeze-dried, dehydrated and canned foods  is great fall-back, nothing can replace fresh crisp garden vegetables  and fragrant, sweet fruit. Increasingly, it is incumbent on individuals  to maintain their own supply of life-sustaining seeds.</p>
<p>Seed vaults are not a new concept and had its roots 40 years ago over  growing concerns for maintaining bio-diversity. A decade ago, it became  mainstream when the global seed vault in Svalbard, Norway took center  stage. It is just one of some 1,400 seeds banks around the world. Bet  this puts a crimp in Monsanto’s Day! As of 2010, in that location alone,  more than 500,000 unique seeds rest waiting to bail out humanity.</p>
<p>So what is the chance that the ordinary human would ever have access? Zip. Zero. Cero. Nada. Zilch. Sero. Nulla. Náid.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a>This one vault of hundreds is in place to serve the  global elite, not us. That Bill and Melinda Gates are instrumental in  this project should say everything. So now we circle around to what we,  the every day person, can do to ensure that we have the same benefits,  sans the New World Order.</p>
<p><em>Create your own seed bank.</em></p>
<p>It is such a simple deal that it seems really silly to write on this  topic. However, it you haven’t investigated it, then maybe it’s <em>not </em>so silly. Maybe it will help <em>you</em>.</p>
<p>This is what you need: seeds. Period. Well, OK, and maybe a bit of  know-how. This article shows you how to maintain your own private seed  bank that will keep you vegetable (therefore vitamin) self-sufficient.  Healthy.</p>
<p><strong>OLDIES AND GOODIES</strong></p>
<p>Seeds have been preserved in ancient Egyptian tombs and found viable to  present day. Remember the mummies? Egyptians completely dried out their  ancestors to the point where scientists today can <em>carefully </em>examine  their bodies. Ditto for Israelis that preserved Judean date palms (the  Methuselah tree) going back to Jesus’ time. Now look at the oldest plant  to have ever have been regenerated from 32,000 year-old seed. OK, don’t  laugh, these seeds were buried by Siberian squirrels – no relation to  Putin – a testament to keeping seeds <em>really </em>cold. Surely we are  smarter than squirrels! Why should it be any different now? It’s not.  You just have to know what to do to keep your seeds viable for many  years.</p>
<p>This is in direct opposition to what seed companies want you to believe,  especially the 6 big opponents to self-sufficiency: Monsanto, Syngenta,  DuPont, Bayer, BASF and Dow. So say them that you can’t keep seeds for  much longer than what the package says, even properly stored. Baloney!  Double ditto <a href="http://standeyo.com/Our_Books/DTP.html#Anchor-CHAPTER-49512" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://standeyo.com/Our_Books/DTP.html#Anchor-CHAPTER-49512', 'for medications');" target="_blank">for medications</a> that drug companies want you to believe ‘die’ quickly as was exposed in <em><a href="http://standeyo.com/Our_Books/DTP.html" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://standeyo.com/Our_Books/DTP.html', 'Dare To Prepare');" target="_blank">Dare To Prepare</a>.</em> This is beyond criminal and wasteful. <strong>Americans buy $350 billion of prescription drugs every year.</strong> Then people needlessly throw a great deal of them away because they believe the pharmecuetical lie.</p>
<p>Shelf lives extend MUCH longer than what they would have you believe. <em>You just have to know what to do</em>. I will share the secrets.</p>

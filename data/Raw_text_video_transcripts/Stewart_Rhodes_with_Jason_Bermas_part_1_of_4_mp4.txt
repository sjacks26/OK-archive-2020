Jason Bermas: [00:00:03] Alright folks we are live, it's the Info Warrior with Jason Bermas. We are now joined by Stewart Rhodes the founder of Oath Keepers. And for people that just tuned in. Stewart Why don't you give a little overview of your biography. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:00:16] I served as a paratrooper in the Army and was disabled in a rough rough terrain parachuting accident and after that I went to college and then worked for Congressman Ron Paul for a year and then after that I a lot of thing between that firearm instructor, sculptor etc. but then I went to Yale Law School. And since then I've been working as a attorney in Montana and also now in Las Vegas. And I start Oath Keepers about a year ago. 

Jason Bermas: [00:00:42] Now what's it like working with Ron Paul for a year. What year was this when when you were. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:00:47] This is back in 98 99. OK. I wanted to go to DC get my D.C. experience but I wanted to do it working for someone has some kind of honor integrity and actually kept his oath and so that was only picked there was. still is. 

Jason Bermas: [00:00:58] Two decades later. That's incredible. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:01:01] Still the only guy. 

Jason Bermas: [00:01:01] So wait a minute I want to. You know this isn't something that really gets talked about lot with you but 21 years ago you served a year with Ron Paul as a young man I mean. Tell me about the experience because obviously you said your. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:01:11] 10 years ago 10 years gone. 

Jason Bermas: [00:01:12] Sorry 10 years ago. Ninety nine. So in 99 you go in and serve. I mean this is this is you know pre-9 11 out there. but you're still aware of Ron Paul and I'd seen some of the I guess more underground documentaries, John Birch Society, global governance that Ron Paul had been featured in. is that kind of how you you've got to know about him or. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:01:30] No, through more conventional libertarian circles and I knew that looking at his voting record he was somebody who just took his oath of office very seriously. And for me it's always been important. 

Jason Bermas: [00:01:40] So was it everything you'd hope for. I mean was it really like wow this guy does have his nose to the grindstone. He's the real deal. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:01:47] He's that he is what he's saying you know he's very very very soft spoken very humble very committed. 

Jason Bermas: [00:01:53] Oh wow so alright. So fast forward 10 years you know things now are so out of control. Why do you think that it took Obama coming into office for you to start. Oath Keepers. I mean what was the big push. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:02:04] It didn't actually during in fact interesting enough during the campaign for Ron Paul's presidency I ran an ad in SWAT magazine called Oath Keepers for Ron Paul. So that was like the first fledgling effort. didn't really go very far because campaign ended that was like the first fledgling effort to do an Oath Keeper kind of movement. but I've been thinking about it for years because the oath is central. Back during a class on the Holocaust, When I was in college, the professors said that no one to hear can can say what they would do under the same conditions you know being ordered to shoot women and children. Of course I would I would just shoot the officer in the head and who gave me that order. and other students in class were like well you know I'd rather be a one guy said I'd rather be a live coward and a dead hero. you know and so I looked at him like you know if I can believe what a craven coward this guy was. And so that got me thinking about the oath and about the importance of being willing not just to fight and die, When you're when you're fighting in a foreign enemy. but also to have the same kind of courage when it comes to refusing orders would be a violation of human rights. 

Jason Bermas: [00:03:02] Absolutely and essentially that's mind control when a professor says you don't know what you do or you don't like. Well no I do know what I do and then write the coward coming in and saying No I'd rather be alive. I mean I don't know how you could live with that on your soul killing innocent women and children. And you know it's so refreshing to see a movement that is about the Constitution and the Bill of Rights and maintaining those oaths to those two key documents. because I really do feel like the majority of Americans no longer feel that that's a requirement to join public office or to join the military it's to take orders. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:03:35] Well they believe the propaganda that we live in a democracy which has majority rule. So once you elect somebody, after that they can do whatever they think is right, Whatever you they think is best. and if you don't like it you just vote them out the next time around. And so it frees them up. and they say well oh the Supreme Court told me whether I'm what I'm doing is right or wrong I'm going to do what I think is best for the population of Texas for example. You know but but the real oath is not to just do it your constituents want. because we don't even have the authority you and I to override our Constitution. unless we're going have a revolution scrapped entirely. But until that point our officials must obey their oaths. And for me as a veteran if I vote for a politician that's going to violate his oath or her oath, I'm violating my own oath. 

Jason Bermas: [00:04:21] Now you just talked about a democracy for those that don't know or are new to this program new to Alex Jones. Explain to people that this is a constitutional republic we're supposed to be living in. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:04:29] Right. You look at the declaration and you can look in the Constitution or the declaration that matter. You won't find the word democracy anywhere. This is a republic and what that means is a system set up to secure natural rights. Majority rule, in the majority rule you have no rights, whatever a majority says goes. you know two wolves and a sheep deciding what's for dinner. This is not what we are, we're a natural rights Republic. Look at the Declaration of Independence. it lays out the purpose of government is to secure your natural rights that pre-exist the government. the government you can never give away your rights. you can't consent to your own rights violations. So the government that that violates your rights is absolutely illegitimate. Even if it has the consent of a majority or even unanimous consent. 

Jason Bermas: [00:05:10] Absolutely. And people don't get that they don't understand that, they just think you know 51 voted against 49 we better go with it. And that's not how is set up. I mean we have states rights for a reason. You know people jump around States because in some states you can do this in other states you can do this. I mean in New York it would be almost impossible for me to get my carry and conceal permit. I come down to Texas probably be a lot easier. There are all these little differences and nuances in this republic. but they want to shatter that they really do want that globalist mentality of we need total control over everything. and I think that's what really this cybersecurity bill is about. I mean I have this thing in front of me. You said earlier on the Alex Jones show that you've had problems with the Internet yourself, that people have not been able to get to your site several times. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:05:54] Well I've heard that. I haven't confirmed that yet. So he has confirmed it. But I've heard that a few on a few military bases. But like he said a lot of sites are blocked. And that's to be expected somewhat to military bases. But the more frightening thing is where they're trying to take that same same idea an expanded far beyond government swept government Web site. 

Jason Bermas: [00:06:13] So you see it in universities all the time. I mean I get people coming in and saying look I can't even get on InfoWars.com in my dorm room. It's a banned web site. It's hate speech and I'm just like oh my God. And you know I was on my Facebook page today and some people out in Europe recently. You know I haven't been able to get on in three days. and all I can tell them is Well maybe you have to change your Internet service provider. I don't know how much more you're going to be able to. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:06:34] Or Use proxy. 

Jason Bermas: [00:06:35] Or use a proxy whether my my buddy who was my editor on my last movie he was out in China and he said look even using proxies I could barely get on to access anywhere. and he said YouTube is totally shut down in China. and you see that move in Australia. and you know most Australians kind of have this westernized mentality that the government's good and everything's going to be OK and we are alarmists. but we're not alarmists we're like look we have freedom of speech for a reason and we have the second amendment for a reason. The second amendment is for when they take that freedom of speech away. and in a lot of respects Stewart I feel like the Internet is the last vestige for them freedom of speech. I mean do you think the the oath keepers would be as successful as they have been in the last 12 months without the internet. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:07:18] Oh no of course not. It's a very powerful tool of communication and it's free and uncensored. And that's the problem for the elites they don't like that. 

Jason Bermas: [00:07:25] Absolutely. So you told me you were with Sheriff Mack today what's the schedule like what have you been doing the last month what are you going to be doing in the next month. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:07:32] Well Sheriff Mack and I both toured Utah together. Him focusing on sheriffs and me just focusing on a broader message of outreach to military and police. And also there's there's two just two sides the oath keepers. One side is is current serving military and police and firefighters. but the other side is the veterans and average citizens and our responsibilities in our community. I always tell people that you have an obligation as a citizen, take full part in your local community. not just voting. just coming together once in a while a vote is not being a real citizen. you must be in your volunteer fire department, you're police auxiliary, sheriff's auxiliary. you know starting neighborhood watches et cetera get to know your neighbors become a stronger community. 

Jason Bermas: [00:08:10] Well I always tell people that they are like oh what can I do. I just want to wrap myself into the fetal position and suck my thumb. It's true. They literally are like that I'm like well you have a kid right yeah. You know I have a seven year old. Well why aren't you on the PTA. Well you know that would take two days out of my month. I'm thinking to myself you have to do something you know run for city council. Get out there get behind you know your congressional candidate you believe and go pester your state senator. You know these things are all around locally. You don't have to be in some you know Metropolis or main hub to do these things. All the small towns out there have local government. And if you don't like something that's being done on the federal or even the state level it's time for you to step in and say all right I'm going to run for mayor of my town, I'm going to run for sheriff. a lot of people don't realize that a sheriff has first of all as an elected position and has a lot of power over his local environment. explain that to people. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:09:05] Well as you pointed out the sheriff is your elected or local law enforcement officer in your county and the highest level of peace officer in your county. And it's that way for a reason, he's elected for a reason. He's supposed to be a guardian of the people's rights. But I've always told people's look start at your county first. don't focus so much on Washington D.C. sure pay attention what they're doing and oppose it. But most of your efforts the focus of your effort should be on your local county. Make sure your own backyard is clean and then the rest of the country will follow suit. take care of your home because we don't know where it was going to happen. Might run out of time, eventually we can we can clean things up from the bottom up. But on the way if you strengthen your local community first no matter what happens, is an economic collapse. You'll be in a much better position to survive that economic collapse and be independent and not need the help of FEMA. If you have a strong community locally. And that's a

JM: In my experience, when you tell a colonel we’re not going to do that, you usually get a formation saying yes you will and if you don’t here’s the consequences. 

SR: Article 15s, right?

JM: Article 15s, rank reductions. That never happened. Without knowing, I have to believe he went, we’re not doing that, don’t worry, doesn’t matter what they say.

SR: I think you have a good point. The negative like that, the formation didn’t happen, the hammer didn’t drop on you

JM: Nothing was discussed even in formation or May and you guys come along, let’s talk. None of that happened.

SR: That’s a good sign

JM: A very good sign I think

SR: To be clear to watchers, military officers because of their political situation might not articulate, they’re a little more savvy than us enlisted guys, we’ll wear our hearts on our sleeves and say what we think. The officers are more clever, they’ll just quietly not doing things.

JM: Exactly. They’ll do it, not out in front of everything, they’ll do it in meetings and quiet discussion. (0:01:20.0) And they have to. I’ve seen it in my career, they may even say they’re on board with something, but they can’t vocalize it like we can.

SR: Unless, if push comes to shove they might have to.

JM: Sure. And I have seen that, in Iraq a commander was pushed when something dangerous was going on and he flat out said I’m not doing that. I don’t care what grade you are, if you’re a 1 star, back off. My guys aren’t doing it. It wasn’t with my group, but I’ve seen it.

SR: (0:01:50.9) You deployed to Iraq in 2003, immediately after the invasion?

JM: Correct

SR: You were there how long?

JM: I was there until early July, I came home for some medical issues. Because we had so many people over there doing nothing, they told me to stay home. There were a group of us that thought we’d be home on 2 week emergency leave to take care of medical issues and go back, and they said you’re staying home. Which was kind of a bummer because all our buddies were there. I wasn’t there too long.

SR: At the time you were a Utah police officer?

JM: (0:02:26.4) At the time, I was a corrections officer in Salt Lake County at the jail. 

SR: So you swore an oath for your military service, and also an oath as a corrections officer. So defending the Constitution of the US and also Utah.

JM: That’s right

SR: A little more background on you, tell the folks how you feel about your oath. You never heard of OK until yesterday correct?

JM: Till yesterday. I’m going why don’t I know about these guys. 

SR: But your oath means something to you already.

JM: Correct. I have to give the due respect to the person who got me recognizing what that oath meant. A few months after everyone came home from Iraq, at a drill, one of the guys in our unit, I could hear him talking and I liked what he had to say most of the time, so I went in and I heard him talking about 95% of the military, we all take an oath to uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies foreign and domestic, but 95% of the military doesn’t even know what the Constitution is. I looked at myself and thought I’m in the 95%. I’m wrong. I need to know what I swore to uphold and defend. So I started really researching and studying the Constitution. I carry one in my wallet now so I can break it out when I have down time, I can quote it to people when they have questions. My favorite class when I was just going to college recently was a political science class that dealt with the Constitution and where it came from and what the Founding Fathers had. I take my oath seriously.

SR: (0:04:11.5) So your buddy woke you up.

JM: He woke me up. It was like getting hit in the back of the head, hey time to get up and start fighting for what’s real. The more I read it, I thought holy cow, what am I doing to let people know? At that point, my wife and I decided to home school our kids so they can learn the Constitution and learn about the Founding Fathers. That’s when I started being extremely vocal about the Constitution within my National Guard unit. My buddies joke that if they ever want to get me riled up, just mention one thing about the Constitution and I’m talking the rest of the day.

SR: (0:04:50.0) So you became what your buddy had been for you, a person to wake up others. This was back in 2003?

JM: This was 04. He left the unit for other better career opportunities that didn’t allow him to come drill anymore. So I’ve taken his place. If somebody mentions the Constitution, we’re gonna have a discussion about it. You’re not gonna get away quickly.

SR: So these discussion were ongoing before Katrina?

JM: Yes. I believe they were. I was fairly new. After coming home from Iraq, I went to a new unit. I live in Salt Lake, a hundred miles away, so I was just coming up on weekends. They were discussion going on already about the Constitution. It usually involved 2A and 4A.

SR: Things you’d be impacting directly during civil disorders.

JM: (0:05:44.9) A lot of the conversation revolved around isn’t it interesting that in Iraq, every household is required to have a gun, and here they’ve talked about taking our guns away.

SR: That’s a weird contrast.

JM: In our Constitution, we’re guaranteed. But in that community, the authority has said that every household will have a weapon.

SR: An AK, right?

JM: An AK. And every man above 17 will also have an individual weapon. So maybe a weapon in the household for mom and the kids, plus a weapon for every adult male. And they’re talking about taking our away, when we have a constitutional guarantee?

SR: The Iraqis do this for what reason?

JM: Security! They had a regime that would come in and do whatever they wanted. They had to bury religious pamphlets because they were afraid if they were seen they’d lose their freedoms.

SR: Cause they’re Shiite in a Sunni dominated country.

JM: Yeah. Even sometimes if you were a Shia in a Sunni area, you had to hide your stuff that showed you were Shia. That’s their culture. When the regime was gone, they said now we’re going to protect ourselves (0:07:15.7). Because that could happen again. Another part probably was we have other nations here, we should be able to defend ourselves if something else happens. Which I can’t disagree with it totally. I don’t like the fact that they can shoot back at me, but I’m not going to shoot civilians anyway, so who cares.

SR: And they’ve got insurgents too.

JM: Right, they have bad guys that want to take them out. I don’t have an issue at all with them having them. I loved it when I was over there. Were you a little nervous when you went into places knowing there was a weapon? Sure. But when you get in there and realized they were law-abiding people, you didn’t care. It was just like when I was in New Orleans and the guy at Cooter Browns showed me the AR. Cool.

SR: Or all those 30 guys standing in a line.

JM: Yeah, with their shotguns. You roll up and say hey, those are my type of people. Because they’re willing to defend what’s theirs. They’re willing to uphold their constitutional rights.

SR: (0:08:09.4) It’s interesting that they were initially nervous about you guys. Did you have a few discussions with them about their situation and how they felt about you?

JM: We did. It took a while for them to open up. Every group has a leader, whether voted on, nominated, or he just turns out to be the leader. The guy who usually ran the group and did a lot of talking, everybody talked to us but when it got into discussions of a more formal matter of this is going on or we’re going to this guy’s house, it was always this one guy.

SR: Who was that guy?

JM: I don’t remember his name, I can see his face. The one thing I remember is he had really think camouflage suspenders and wore them all the time.

SR: An old Cajun guy?

JM: He was older, well, he was probably late 30s, early 40s.

SR: Was he a vet?

JM: I don’t know. We never got into that. It’s kind of weird. Some of the guys we talked to told us they were vets. This guy I never got involved with. If I were to guess I’d say probably, based on the acronyms he used.

SR: (0:09:12.9) Once he realized you weren’t bad guys there to disarm him, what’d he have to say?

JM: It was more his actions. When he saw the Humvee rolling down the street, he’d wave us over. Say hey you guys have enough to eat tonight, you good? They were taking better care of us than we were them, as far as food.

SR: What was the nickname they had for you?

JM: They called me Sgt. Big Guy. They called my friend Sgt. Tree Trunk, cause he was taller than me. It was in that Cajun accent, so it was really funny when they called us over cause I didn’t know what he was saying at first. Good group of guys. They were there to help. Once they realized we were helping them, they were helping us, telling us that car doesn’t belong here, I’ve never seen it in this neighborhood before, what can we do? I’ll call the police officer and he’ll check it out.

SR: I hate to use the dirty M word. But they were basically acting as an ad-hoc militia.

JM: Yes.

SR: They took care of each other.

JM: That’s how I looked at it. They were their town’s militia. They weren’t state militia, but they were acting as that town’s militia.

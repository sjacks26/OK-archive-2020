<h2 style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>About Oath Keepers</strong></em></h2>
<p>Oath Keepers is a non-partisan association of current and formerly serving military, police, and first responders who pledge to fulfill the oath all military and police take to “defend the Constitution against all enemies, foreign and domestic.” That oath, mandated by <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articlevi" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articlevi', 'Article VI ');" target="_blank"><em><strong>Article VI</strong> </em></a>of the Constitution itself, is to the Constitution, not to the politicians, and Oath Keepers declare that they will not obey unconstitutional orders, such as orders to disarm the American people, to conduct warrantless searches, or to detain Americans as “enemy combatants” in violation of their ancient right to jury trial. See the Oath Keepers Declaration of <a href="../10-orders-we-will-not-obey/index.html" target="_blank"><strong>Orders We Will Not Obey</strong> </a>for details.</p>
<p>.<br/>
Oath Keepers reaches out to both current serving and veterans to remind them of their oaths, to teach them more about the Constitution they swore to defend, and to inspire them to defend it. See below for details on how we do that.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">.<br/>
Our motto is:  <em><strong>“Not on our watch!”</strong></em></p>
<p>.<br/>
* First responders includes fire-fighters, search and rescue, EMTs, disaster relief, and similar emergency personnel. While not all such personnel take an oath to the Constitution, many do, and all are a critical audience for our mission. Current Serving and Veterans, you swore an Oath…</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>Military Enlisted Oath</strong></em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong><em>I, (NAME), do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same; and that I will obey the orders of the President of the United States and the orders of the officers appointed over me, according to regulations and the Uniform Code of Military Justice. So help me God.</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>Military Officers Oath</strong></em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><strong>I, [name], do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same; that I take this obligation freely, without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion; and that I will well and faithfully discharge the duties of the office on which I am about to enter. So help me God.</strong></em></p>
<p> </p>
<p>NOTE: While the enlisted oath does contain a pledge to obey the orders of the President and of commanding officers, that is still preceded by a pledge to “defend the Constitution,” and is also qualified by the requirement that such orders be “according to regulations and the Uniform Code of Military Justice.” Any order, by anyone, that is not constitutional or according to regulations, is unlawful and military personnel are not obligated to follow such orders – and, in fact, are obligated to refuse. In contrast to the enlisted oath, the oath of military officers is to the Constitution alone, without qualification. To learn more about the history of the military oath, go &lt; <a href="http://www.history.army.mil/html/faq/oaths.html" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.history.army.mil/html/faq/oaths.html', 'here');" target="_blank"><em><strong>here</strong></em></a> &gt;</p>
<p> </p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Veterans, your Oath NEVER expires! It’s time to keep it!</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Full membership is open to currently serving military, reserves, National Guard, police, fire-fighters, other first responders (i.e. State Guard, Sheriff Posse/Auxiliary, Search &amp; Rescue, EMT, other medical 1st responders, etc.) and veterans/former members of those services. We welcome those who are not current or prior service also. You are invited to join as an Associate Member – as a citizen who supports our mission.</p>

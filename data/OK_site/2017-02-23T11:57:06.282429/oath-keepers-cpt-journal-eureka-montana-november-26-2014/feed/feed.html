<content:encoded>Agree with you 100% Nnip. There is a term that covers what you are talking about and it is “BATTLEFIELD PICKUP”. This term I believe covers your last sentence. You use what you find in a bad situation to best of your advantage. There is going to be a lot of 223 and 556 around no matter where you go in America. Good article Nnip.

<content:encoded>with the fact im in northern cali i have more than one radio/reciever i have a police and emergancy scanner radio as well as a citizens band and a marine radio that acually monitor c.g frequencies off the california coast and collect intel for troop strength ,local equipment and logistical landings in s.f/port of oakland so having a set of eyes on the west coast can be benificial to a successful defence/insurgency stratagy for you so it would be in o.k. best intrests to have the benefits of transmission to you regarding this intel i would rather not use a cell phone to transmit this vital inte due to the fact they are more closely monitored than ham frequencies and all the free government telephone handouts have g.p.s.location trackers built inside that would get me captured by enemy agents and other pro socialist loyalists to our political jokes in office thank you for your time robert…..c

<content:encoded>the reason that i have a handheld model to be able to communicate with O.K.anywhere i can seek refuge because i will be fighting a running battle with the enemy and if i need to retreat and regroup and to coodinate joint offensives wherever oathkeepers takes me

<content:encoded>Dana, 
<p>I agree 100%. Those Rights are given to us by our Creator, not the Constitution. The Constitution is there to protect those Rights.</p>

<content:encoded>Woody,
<p>I definitely agree. The Right to Bear Arms cannot be infringed. Inalienable means just that: inalienable.</p>

<content:encoded>Shorty Dawkins,
<p>I agree, and you must agree that the government’s infringement upon our right to keep and bear arms is also not what the Constitution is all about, no matter how “reasonable” the infringements.  Quite the contrary. The rights guaranteed by the 2nd Amendment are just as much a part of OUR Constitution as is the 1st Amendment. Bear in mind that no government in the history of mankind has ever instituted an unreasonable law, and that all laws are conceived with the best of intentions.  We all know where that road leads.<br/>

<content:encoded>LD- they can amend the US Constitution all they want and delete the 2A but you will still have the right to arms. The 2A doesn’t give us that right, you were born with that right. The same thing applies if they changed the constitution (or if magically modified by SCOTUS) to say you don’t have the right to a jury trial, or freedom of religion, speech, etc. etc., you would still possess those rights regardless of what government says or the mob votes for. You were born with those unalienable rights and NO ONE has the authority take them away.

<content:encoded>Very good article, common sense says, if anyone is to have their weapons confiscated to insure the safety of our citizens, it should be the Federal Agents.

<content:encoded>Well, yes.  Other nations in the English-speaking world implemented this idea back in the 80s and 90s.  The immediate result was that these “psychological tests” were administered by liberals and dedicated Party men who announced up front “the desire to own a firearm is ipso facto a sign of mental illness.  Anyone who wants to own a deadly baby-killing assault rifle is mentally sick and should not be allowed such privileges.”

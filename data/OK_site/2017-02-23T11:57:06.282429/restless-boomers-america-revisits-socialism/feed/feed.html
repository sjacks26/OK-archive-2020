<content:encoded>Democratic Socialism…  Schools ? Garbage Collection?  Sidewalks?  Fire &amp; EMT’s?  40 Hour Work Week?  Pensions?  Social Security?  Medicare? FDA? EPA? CDC? Unemployment? HUD? Public Busses &amp; Subways?  Safe: Water, Alcohol, Drugs? NASA? Public Universities?  Civil Rights? Minimum Wage? OSHA?
<p>In 1890 none of these things existed. If your house was on fire, it burned.  You walked in the mud.  You never learned to read.  Garbage &amp; swarming rats everywhere.  You worked, or you starved.  If you got sick, you died.  If you drank poisoned liquor or snake oil, you died.  When you got old, you died.  You believed that the earth was the center of the universe, because there was no science or education.  Your family was broken up: men sent to debtors prison &amp; the women &amp; children to the “poor house”.  Life was the definition of hell.</p>
<p>When a country is run by Bankers it’s Capitalism also known as NATIONAL SOCIALISM… and we’ve seen where that leads.  When it’s “Human Capital” they call it slavery. We didn’t fight the Civil War to free the slaves, it was a fight between “cradle-to-grave slavery” and “wage slavery”.</p>
<p>A pictures worth a thousand words: Here are pictures of Bernie’s and Hillary’s rally’s… there is no denying the movement.  Her crowd shots are staged to show support.</p>

<p>Hillary had one in NYC. With 20 million people within driving distance, she had only 5,000. Her rally in Ft Lauderdale had 700.  At Dartmouth College in New Hampshire… 850.</p>
<p>Bernie is overflowing stadiums: Portland, ME 9,000; LA 27,000; Portland, OR 20,000; Boston 30,000; Tucson, AZ 13,000; Seattle, WA 15,000; Reno, NV 4,500; Greensboro,NC 5,000; 2 in South Carolina totaling 10,000; Liberty University,VA 9,000; Madison,WI 10,000; Phoenix,AZ 11,000; Council Bluffs,IA 2,000; Burlington,VT 5,000; Boulder, CO 9,000; University of Houston,TX 5,200; Dallas,TX 8,000; Dubuque,WV 2,800… and we still have a year to go… </p>
<p>Please support an anti-establishment candidate next year… Both Sanders and Trump will change the balance of power in Washington.</p>

<content:encoded>Bernie Sanders is perhaps the only honest candidate in the Presidential election. I would just like to point out how frightened of him the corporate media, etc., is of him, as they repeatedly fail to report on his huge crowds for speaches and mis-reported his debate results. His idea is essentially to return power to the people themselves, not unlike that line “We the People” we’ve all heard so much about. He’s the only one who has consistently for decades worked to have the law apply equally to all persons, worked to limit the influence of the ultra wealthy on politics, spoken out about the banksters and all the rest. One need only actually look at his record. I think this group, like so many others, has gotten stuck on the word “socialist” rather than actually discover for oneself what this Senator has actually put his neck out for over and over again. I have great respect for this man, and his work, and I would hope that at least some of you realize that his aims are not so far off from your own as you have been lead to believe.

<content:encoded>Bernie believes that 95% of the people should have 50% of the wealth… Like we had in the golden age of America  (1946-1963), when the GI BILL sent tens of millions of Americans to college, and the middle class was an achievable goal.  When we had manufacturing jobs and built the American Highway System… We went to the damn moon, people!
<p>This was before Vietnam, the death of JFK and the domination of the Military Industrial Complex… destroyed us. Wealth in America is like a neighborhood pizza party, where one guy takes the whole pie and leaves a greasy stain for the other 99 guests to lick.</p>
<p>Here he is telling a “gun-control advocate” why he supports the right to keep and bear arms.<br/>

<p>For those who claim we can’t pay for Democratic Socialism: Maybe we can find some savings in our military budget?  (Hey, isn’t the US Military the largest, most successful socialist organization in the world? Free; food, healthcare, housing, pension, etc… we can do this) read this chart &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>

<p>Please read this honest biography of a decent, common man and tell me he doesn’t sound like most of us.<br/>

<content:encoded>A card laid is a card played…..the hand writing is on the wall and has been there for some time now. The Iran nuclear deal, the TPP, Common Core, Socialism out of control, the Popes visit to the UN and now the Attorney General (Lynch) getting the SCN (Strong Cities Network) started. This is by far the most serious deal and is selling our Sovereignty and Constitution down the river. The SCN is a UN One World Police Force situation and allows UN boots to be here in our cities all across America to train and blend into our security and policing system. UN personnel would not have any problem firing on Americans if the situation called for it.The UN program will over ride American law and is Sharia compliant and they can dictate policy without Congressional consultation. Do some research about the SCN program that has gone basically unnoticed and it will get your attention. Anyone can visualize what could soon happen. God Bless America !!

<content:encoded>Great article. But those of you who do not vote will be part of the problem and downfall of our Republic. We do have some great constitutionalist running with the voting record to prove so. Ted Cruz, is an exceptional constitutionalst and outsider Ben Carson has a great respect for the bill of rights. If you stand on the sidelines and just watch you are just as culpable as the bleeding heart teenage voting for Bernie for the first time. Our goal is to move the ball always forward to our goal. It took the Dems 50 years to destroy the youth and infiltrate our schools. We now have to thing in the same terms. We’re not gonna throw a Hail Mary and get it all back in one play.

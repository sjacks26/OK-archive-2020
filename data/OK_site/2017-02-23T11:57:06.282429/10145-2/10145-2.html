<p>According to financial research firm ICI, total retirement assets in the Land of the Free now exceed $23 trillion.</p>
<p><strong>$7.3 trillion of that is held in Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs).</strong></p>
<p>That’s an appetizing figure, especially <strong>for a government that just passed $19 trillion in debt and is in pressing need of new funding sources.</strong></p>
<p>Even when you account for all federal assets (like national parks and aircraft carriers), the government’s “net financial position” according to its own accounting is negative $17.7 trillion.</p>
<p>And that number doesn’t include unfunded Social Security entitlements, which the government estimates is another $42 trillion.</p>
<p>The US national debt has increased by roughly $1 trillion annually over the past several years.</p>
<p>The Federal Reserve has conjured an astonishing amount of money out of thin air in order to buy a big chunk of that debt.</p>
<p>But even the Fed has limitations. According to its own weekly financial statement, the Fed’s solvency is at precariously low levels (with a capital base of just 0.8% of assets).</p>
<p>And on a mark-to-market basis, the Fed is already insolvent. So it’s foolish to think they can continue to print money forever and bail out the government without consequence.</p>
<p>The Chinese (and other foreigners) own a big slice of US debt as well.</p>
<p>But it’s just as foolish to expect them to continue bailing out America, especially when they have such large economic problems at home.</p>
<p>US taxpayers own the largest share of the debt, mostly through various trust funds of Social Security and Medicare.</p>
<p><strong>But again, given the $42 trillion funding gap in these programs, it’s mathematically impossible for Social Security to continue funding the national debt.</strong></p>
<p><strong>This reality puts the US government in rough spot.</strong></p>
<p>It’s not like government spending is going down anytime soon; it already takes nearly 100% of tax revenue just to pay mandatory entitlements like Social Security, and interest on the debt.</p>
<p>Plus the government itself estimates that the national debt will hit $30 trillion within ten years.</p>
<p><strong>Bottom line, they need more money.</strong> Lots of it. <em><strong>And there is perhaps no easier pool of cash to ‘borrow’ than Americans’ retirement savings.</strong></em></p>
<p>$7.3 trillion in US IRA accounts is too large for them to ignore.</p>
<p>And if you think it’s inconceivable for the government to borrow your retirement savings, just consider the following:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>1) Borrowing retirement funds is becoming a popular tactic.</strong></p>
<p>Forced loans have been a common tactic of bankrupt governments throughout history.</p>
<p>Plus there’s recent precedent all over the world; Hungary, France, Ireland, and Poland are among many governments that have resorted to ‘borrowing’ public and private pension funds.</p>
<p><strong>2) The US government has already done this with federal pension funds.</strong></p>
<p>During the multiple debt ceiling fiascos since 2011, the Treasury Department resorted to “extraordinary measures” at least twice in order to continue funding the government.</p>
<p>What exactly were these extraordinary measures?</p>
<p>They dipped into federal retirement funds and borrowed what they needed to tide them over.</p>
<p>In fact, the debt ceiling debacles were only resolved because the Treasury Department had fully depleted available retirement funds.</p>
<p><strong>3) They’ve been paving the way to borrow your retirement savings for a long time.</strong></p>
<p>Two years ago the government launched a new initiative to ‘help Americans save for retirement.’</p>
<p>It’s called MyRA. And the idea is for people to invest retirement savings ‘in the safety and security of US government bonds’.</p>
<p>Since then they’ve gone on a marketing offensive involving the President, Treasury Secretary, and other prominent politicians.</p>
<p>(Most recently Nancy Pelosi published an Op-Ed in the San Francisco Chronicle a few days ago promoting the program.)</p>
<p>They’ve also proposed a number of legislative reforms to ‘encourage’ American businesses to sign their employees up for MyRA.</p>
<p>Just last week, Congress introduced the “Making Your Retirement Accessible”, or MyRA Act, which would charge a penalty to employers whose workers don’t have a retirement account.</p>
<p>The proposed penalty is $100. Per worker. Per day.</p>
<p>Imagine a small business with, say, 10 employees who don’t have retirement accounts. The penalty to Uncle Sam would be a whopping $30,000 PER MONTH.</p>
<p><strong>There’s a word for this. It’s called extortion.</strong></p>
<p>Obviously when facing a $30,000 monthly penalty, an employer will pick the easiest option.</p>
<p>Given the absurd amount of government regulation on the rest of the financial industry, MyRA is the fastest choice.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>This isn’t about fear or paranoia. It’s about facts.</strong></p>
<p>And the reality is that the government in the Land of the Free is moving in the direction of borrowing more and more of your retirement savings.</p>
<p><strong>If you still remain skeptical, remember that last year the government stole more from its citizens through Civil Asset Forfeiture than thieves in the private sector.</strong></p>
<p>Or that just 45-days ago a new law went into effect authorizing the government to strip you of your passport if they believe in their sole discretion that you owe them too much tax.</p>
<p><em><strong>No judge. No jury. No trial. They just confiscate your passport.</strong></em></p>

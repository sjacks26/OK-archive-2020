## Video of SR on Bill O’Reilly’s show from 2/18/2010

BO: Last night we interviewed Mark Potok, who talked about OK

MP: The group is really about the fear that martial law is about to imposed, that Americans will be herded into concentration camps, that foreign troops will be here.

BO: Joining us is SR, founder and brief bio. Tell us about the group before we get into the ideology. How many people are in it? Requirements for membership? (0:00:48.5)

SR: Full member requires current or former military, police, firefighter. Associate member for everyone else. 15,000 on our forums, not all are members. About 6,000 dues paying members.

BO: How much are dues? (0:01:14.4)

SR: $30

BO: You started this a year ago. Are you associated with the Tea Party at any level? (0:01:25.2)

SR: I’ve been to a lot of Tea Party events, I’m on the planning committee for the one on 9/11, next September, marchondc.org. We like the Tea Party movement, it’s great. It’s a revitalization of good core Americanism and core constitutionalism. (0:01:42.0)

BO: *Reads some of the orders they will not obey* Who’s gonna try to disarm people and place them under martial law? Why would that even be something you would be discussing? (0:02:08.8)

SR: It happened as recently as Katrina. You’ve probably seen the videos there of an old lady being tackled in her kitchen and disarmed of her revolver. And there were house to house searches for firearms. You had the police chief declare that no one would be allowed to have weapons, we’re gonna take all the guns. And they did. So they disarmed Americans over bad weather, as though the bad weather suspended the 2nd Amendment. That’s the most recent example. (0:02:33.3)

BO: It was more than that. The local authorities could not control what was going on in the city. You had looters who were armed going in and stealing thing, and this directive was…

SR: It wasn’t just looters they disarmed, they disarmed average American citizens (0:02:48.8).

BO: They disarmed everybody.

SR: Yeah

BO: Because we’re in a state of emergency. But that’s after a hurricane wipes out half the city. 

SR: Where does it say in the Constitution that bad weather suspends the Constitution?

BO: It’s not a matter of bad weather. (0:03:08.7) It’s a matter of you can’t control the city. If a mayor or a governor has a state of emergency, you have a city that’s out of control like in the 60s, you remember some of those riots, and they say we’re gonna impose a curfew, you can’t go out after a certain time, you can’t have a gun, you can’t assemble, because we have an out of control situation. You’re gonna tell your people not to obey those laws? (0:03:38.6)

SR: Disarming an average law-abiding citizen, blanket like that

BO: Just state of emergency

SR:  Call it what you want, it’s still unconstitutional.

BO: That’s a pretty extreme position. Let me ask you about this. (0:03:55.7) You also say we are in a battle for the hearts and minds of our troops. What does that mean?

SR: There is a thought in the minds of some that their oath is just to the president, not first and foremost to the Constitution.

BO: The Commander-in-Chief

SR: In Germany the oath was to the fuhrer

## These last two lines were them talking over each other. 

BO: The Commander-in-Chief is the president, by our Constitution (0:04:29.5). If he issues an order, are you telling people not to obey the order if they don’t like it?

SR: If it’s unconstitutional, yes. The oath is to the

BO: In whose opinion, the individual soldier? Each soldier makes up his mind whether the order is constitutional? (0:04:42.2)

SR: What were the Nazis told at Nuremberg? That just obeying orders was no excuse, no defense. They have an individual obligation. This is well-established in military law.

BO: I know military law, and there are things in there that if a guy says you have to kill those civilians, you say no we don’t. But I’m saying in general terms, you can’t have a military or police force if each officer and soldier and marine says we’ll obey whichever orders we want, we don’t think it’s constitutional (0:05:12.3). That seems to be what you’re putting out there.

SR: There’s a presumption that orders are lawful, so it’s a heavy burden to meet. (0:05:21.7) But if you obey an unlawful order, you can also be in trouble. There’s not just gonna go do this lightly, they’ll do it when it’s most serious. Because there are serious repercussions if you disobey a lawful order, but you can be tried and convicted for obeying an unlawful order, too. 

BO: If it’s clearly not lawful, I got it. But if it’s a matter of interpretation, you can have anarchy easily. 

SR: No, you’ll have guys who are at risk of court martial. They’ll only do it when it’s really serious.

<p style="text-align: justify;">Testimonial: In light of the radical gun laws being proposed in Washington, NY, CA, Mo., perhaps it is time to finally come to grips with what is really happening. These lawmakers, who have taken an oath to protect and defend the constitution, have decided instead to trash it for you, your children and grandchildren. They need to have the light of day shed on them. Perhaps it is time to contribute to the formation of a web site listing their names, and physical addresses. Local rallies could be planed in front of their homes, to show what we think of those who would take our freedoms and liberties that have been guaranteed us, by the Constitution. These would be peaceful rallies, only to show them that “we know where you live”. Most gun owners I know have always taken the live, and let live approach to life. As long as what you do does not impact me or my family in a negative way, go ahead and do your thing. Well, the radical left has chosen to bring this fight to us, basically because they have seen the way we have conducted our lives in the past, regarding things we didn’t particularly believe in, “live and let live”. It is time to make it crystal clear, “this does affect us and our families in a negative way”. Washington, Jefferson, Adams, all were very prominent men, and could have chosen to live their lives out in relative comfort and prominent positions. They chose the path to freedom, risking their wealth and lives, to give us what has made this the greatest nation on earth. Now it is time for all of us to make the same choice, “What Price Freedom ?”<br/>
“Now Is The Time For All Good Men To Come To The Aid Of Their Country”. Trivial ?</p>

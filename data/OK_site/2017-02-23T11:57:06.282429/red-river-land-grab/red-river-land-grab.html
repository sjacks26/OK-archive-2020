<p>The BLM has taken a huge new step forward in its land grabbing agenda. The latest victim is a cattle rancher and farmer from the Red River area of Texas. Ken Aderholt’s family has owned some of these contested lands for generations. Unlike the Bundy’s and the Finicum’s this dispute is not about public lands but rather deeded private land.</p>
<p>Ken Aderholt is a family man who is married with 2 kids. He is one of the few still living the American dream, for now. Ken and his family farms and ranches are along the Red River in Texas. His Grandfather bought the property in 1941 and Ken grew up on the land, building fences and working the cows as any ranching family does. After his grandfather died in 1989 the land then went to his father. Who leased it to Ken after he bought out half of his grandfathers cattle. In 1989 he moved his family the home that his grandfather had lived in since 1941. This is just the life that Ken and his family had pictured living. That is up to a couple of weeks before Christmas in 2013 when a couple of game wardens called the families along the Red River to a meeting in Wichita Falls to figure out how they were going to manage the property along the Red River that they were now suddenly claiming to own. The unfortunate part of this claim is that land is already owned by the residents that live along the 100+ mile area of the Red River, including close to half of Ken’s land including his family home! During the meeting they set up a scoping period that has lasted close to 2 years. This period is almost over. The Governor of Texas has had some encouraging words on the subject that he included in a letter to the BLM. Here is a .pdf of the <a href="https://www.oathkeepers.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/BLMLetter_10162015.pdf" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'download', 'https://www.oathkeepers.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/BLMLetter_10162015.pdf');">BLM Letter</a> However, it remains to be seen if the Governor will actually step in and call up his state troops and the Texas Rangers to intervene on the resident’s behalf. If not the Oath Keepers will be ready to take action to help keep this hard working American family in their home.</p>
<p>Please take the time to watch this video interview and share it out. Also check back for updates to this situation.</p>

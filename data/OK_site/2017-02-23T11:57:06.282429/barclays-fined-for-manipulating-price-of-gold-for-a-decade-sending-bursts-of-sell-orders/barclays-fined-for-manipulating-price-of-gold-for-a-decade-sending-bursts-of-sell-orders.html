<p>If you haven’t yet realized that ALL financial markets are rigged, it is time you opened your eyes. – Shorty Dawkins, Associate Editor</p>

<p>by Tyler Durden</p>
<p>It was almost inevitable: a week after we wrote “<a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2014-05-14/rothschild-koch-industries-meet-people-who-fix-price-gold" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2014-05-14/rothschild-koch-industries-meet-people-who-fix-price-gold', 'From Rothschild To Koch Industries: Meet The People Who “Fix” The Price Of Gold');" style="outline: 0px none; text-decoration: none;" target="_blank">From Rothschild To Koch Industries: Meet The People Who “Fix” The Price Of Gold</a>” and days after “<a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2014-05-20/barclays-head-gold-trading-and-gold-fixer-leaving-bank" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2014-05-20/barclays-head-gold-trading-and-gold-fixer-leaving-bank', 'Barclays’ Head Of Gold Trading, And Gold “Fixer”, Is Leaving The Bank');" style="outline: 0px none; text-decoration: none;" target="_blank">Barclays’ Head Of Gold Trading, And Gold “Fixer”, Is Leaving The Bank</a>“,  earlier today the UK Financial Conduct Authority finally formalized  what most in the “tin-foil” hat community had known for years, when it  announced that it fined Barclays £26 million for manipulating “the  setting of the price of gold in order to avoid paying out on a client  order.” Furthermore, the FCA confirmed that those inexplicable gold  raids which come as if out of nowhere, and slam gold with a vicious  force so strong sometime they halt the entire market, had a very  specific source: <em><strong>Barclays</strong></em>, whose trader Daniel James Plunkett, <a href="http://companycheck.co.uk/director/918213336/MR-DANIEL-JAMES-PLUNKETT" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://companycheck.co.uk/director/918213336/MR-DANIEL-JAMES-PLUNKETT', 'born 1976');" style="outline: 0px none; text-decoration: none;" target="_blank">born 1976</a>,<strong> “sent out a burst of orders aimed at moving the price of the yellow metal.” </strong></p>
<p>This took place for a decade. As the <a href="http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/08cafa70-e24f-11e3-a829-00144feabdc0.html" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/08cafa70-e24f-11e3-a829-00144feabdc0.html', 'FT reports');" style="outline: 0px none; text-decoration: none;" target="_blank">FT reports</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="quote_start"></div>
<div class="quote_end"></div>
<p>The FCA said Barclays had failed to “adequately manage conflicts of  interest between itself and its customers as well as systems and  controls failings, in relation to the gold fixing” between 2004 and  2013.</p></blockquote>
<p>Some further details on Plunkett’s preferred means of manipulating the gold price.</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="quote_start"></div>
<div class="quote_end"></div>
<p><strong>The FCA said Mr Plunkett had manipulated the market by  placing, withdrawing and re-placing a large sell order for between  40,000 oz and 60,000 oz of gold bars.</strong></p>
<p>He did this in an attempt to pull off a “mini puke”, which the FCA  took to mean a sharp fall in the price of gold. As a result, the bank  was not obliged to make a $3.9m payment to the customer under an option  contract.</p></blockquote>
<p>Which is precisely what we have shown many times here for example in “<a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2013-09-12/vicious-gold-slamdown-breaks-gold-market-20-seconds" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2013-09-12/vicious-gold-slamdown-breaks-gold-market-20-seconds', 'Vicious Gold Slamdown Breaks Gold Market For 20 Seconds');" style="outline: 0px none; text-decoration: none;" target="_blank">Vicious Gold Slamdown Breaks Gold Market For 20 Seconds</a>“,  when a sell order so aggressive comes in it not only takes out the  entire bid stack with an intent not for “best execution” but solely to  reprice the market lower. Recall from September:</p>
<div class="quote_start"></div>
<div class="quote_end"></div>
<p>“There was a time when, if selling a sizable amount of a security, one  tried to get the best execution price and not alert the buyers  comprising the bid stack that there is (substantial) volume for sale. Of  course, there was and always has been a time when one tried to  manipulate prices by slamming the bid until it was fully taken out,  usually just before close of trading, an illegal practice known as  “banging the close.” It appears that when it comes to gold, the former  is long gone history, and the latter is perfectly legal. As the two  charts below from Nanex demonstrate, overnight just before 3 am Eastern,  a block of just 2000 GC gold futures contracts slammed the price of  gold, on no news as usual, sending it lower by $10/oz. However, that is  not new: such slamdowns happen every day in the gold market, and the  CFTC constantly turns a blind eye. What was different about last night’s  slam however, is that this time whoever was doing the forced,  manipulation selling, just happened to also break the market. Indeed:  following the hit, the entire gold market was NASDARKed for 20 seconds  after a circuit breaker halted trading!<br/>
“To summarize: a humble block of 2000 gold futs (GC) taking out the bid stack, and slamming the price of gold, managed to halt the gold market: one of the largest “asset” markets in the world in terms of total notional, for 20 seconds.”</p>

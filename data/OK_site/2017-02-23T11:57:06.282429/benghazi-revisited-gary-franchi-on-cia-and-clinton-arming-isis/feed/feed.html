<content:encoded>Hi Shorty, Yes I have heard of operation paper clip I should have said Nuremberg trials, I guess it was just a side show. I did look up the info about Clare, all over the internet, but I  had never heard of it and it goes back three years. I was going to say that I can’t believe he is still in office, but in these fast and insane times not much amazes me anymore.

<content:encoded>The problem is, as I see it, that when the laws of men are ignored, the laws of physics take over.  It is not the first time that a society, or even our society has allowed this path to be taken.  But make no mistake about it.  Our laws are blatently being violated and are failing, at an accelerated rate.  Patriots must all make sure that when the fit hits the shan, the laws of physics are on our side.  We should not be bewildered at how these circumstances can exist,  Rather, we should logically conclude from these circumstances that our government is now illegitimate, and our republic and liberty is in peril.  Never give up freedom for peace, as you cannot have the latter without the former. Parabellum.

<content:encoded>Editors, or somebody, I did not sleep last night thinking about this article.I cant read U-Tube/Video stuff I am on dial up SLOW. I have known about these things in theory and from hearing about them on internet,but I must of have missed this one on Clare Lopez. She was a C.I.A. operative she has blown the whistle on Benghazi and no one is in Jail? I know D.C. is a haunt for every unclean kind of bird, but this is way above that. This is out in the open congress had it’s hearing and nothing has changed. Is that just the way it is? Why didn’t they just let the Nazi’s go after the war? I am really confused about this, can some one explain it to me? I am serious

<content:encoded>Dang!  I tell ya, my thinking on this is 1) the overall complexities that MUST have been discussed by ‘who knows how many ppl’ is mind-boggling.  However, (and in the same breath), even the best laid plans can be torn to shreds (simply because it is so complex there is no way “they” count have planned for every possible scenario that may well climb out of this hole they are digging ….for us.<br/>
For me, 2016 will be my 3rd year of non-compliance (at all levels) with unconstitutional “new” laws and matters “of the like.”  I urge everyone in America (gun owners with grey-matter) to do the same …for starters.<br/>
It also would not do us any harm in the least to write our reps and “without question WARN THEM” that because of THEIR ‘dumbass’ actions (or lack of them) WILL RESULT IN CIVIL WAR and then watch how fast “they” start backing down and “re-thinking” their strategies …giving us time to run the bastards off before they can inflict any more harm.  We can do it peacefully, and The Constitution tells us precisely HOW to deal with a tyrannical government “gone mad” …or if they’d prefer we can blow off/cut off their heads instead of just letting them walk away unharmed (same difference to me).<br/>
Otherwise, who can NOT see what this will become should we not make a stand very soon?  (Hint:  If we wait, we’ll not only have American resistance against us, but UN and ???? others as well …think about it).<br/>
There has already been a “Call to Arms”  (That didn’t impress me though ….considering that only about 5 Sheriffs “made the call” out of zillions of Sheriffs who said “not a word” – – meaning THEY are already on the wrong side of the fence, shouldn’t I think (especially when you can’t find any evidence to the contrary)?<br/>
Well whatever folks.  It’s Monday. Yuk.  Raining!  (that’s okay …gives me an excuse to just sit and “die and shape” out new, once-fired and ‘dunno how many fired’ boolits till the cows come home.
<p>Got a question for everyone here</p>

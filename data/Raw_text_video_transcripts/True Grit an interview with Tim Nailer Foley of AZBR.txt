JVT: I have TF of Arizona Border Recon. I know a lot of our viewers are already familiar with the work AZBR is doing on our southern border. You’ve had quite a bit of exposure this year. Can you tell us a bit about your history, what you were doing before you did this, and what prompted you to start AZBR?

TF: I’m always into waking people up to what’s happening on the border. Back in 2008-2009, I was building high-rises. I was the guy they handed the blueprints to, I ran 150 man crews, making about $85k a year. Then the collapse in 08, everything went to heck in a handbasket. I went from $85k a year to $12k a year on unemployment. So I started traveling the country trying to pick up work, 3 weeks here, 2 weeks there, a month there. Maybe $15-20 an hour. I started looking at the wages were being pressed by the amount of illegal aliens who, according to the government, were doing jobs that we won’t do, which is just their narrative, it’s not true. So I decided while I had a little money left that I should try to put an end to it. I came down to the border and lived in my truck for 2 months. Would go out in the day and locate the trails, GPS them, at night I’d go back and lock myself in my truck since it was just me, no matter what I heard I wouldn’t get out of my truck. I heard about a meeting of some people 2 months into it. I came over to where I am now, they had rented a house, the only house around where the roof didn’t leak. I decided to join up with them. In 6 months, all 4 were gone. I decided to stay, and I’ve been on the border ever since.

JVT: (0:03:02.9) Do you come from a military background? Did you teach these skills to yourself? How did you come across the skill sets you need for doing what you’re doing?

TF: I do have a military background. I was 82nd Airborne, a combat engineer. What little I did get, being a combat engineer is building and blowing up bridges and stuff like that. Most of it I taught myself. I tell people, if you come down here and have a military background that’s great. But [garbled] because this is totally different. The tactics are different, it’s all small unit, stealth, trying to get around the cartel scouts. In my area I have over 75 cartel scout locations GPS’d. 3-4 can see my place at any given time, so they know when I move, when I go out, if I head to the big city to get supplies, they know I’m gone for the day so they can move stuff closer to the house. They know who we are. I taught myself how to track, how to be a sneaky Pete out here. They own all the high ground, it’s tough getting in and around them. It takes a while to realize which mountains they’re on, once you figure that out you have to figure out where the blind spots are so you can, I like to do rolling dumps, with guys in the truck, when we hit the blind spot, everybody bails out of the truck except the driver, he keeps driving and they don’t realize we’re out and moving towards the scout location. One of our primary goals is to go after the scouts. If you take out their eyes, they’re running blind on the ground. I call them drug traffic control, sitting up high. The mountains down here, they’re quite the monster to get up. My house sits at 3600 feet, the mountains around me go up to 4800-5600 feet. The scouts are sitting up there, each probably has a 200+ square mile view of the surrounding AZ land. They can see you coming for an hour off. That’s what makes it so easy for them. Border Patrol does it on the shift mentality, they don’t change the shifts, so they just sit and wait and when they see the big convoy of trucks heading north, they know they have about an hour to get stuff through and as deep as possible.

JVT: (0:06:34.8) I really feel that the average American has no idea just how bad it really is down there on the border. According to mainstream media, everything’s just hunky dory. You and I know that’s not the case at all. How bad is it? I hear reports, I’m up in Montana so I’m not boots on the ground like you are, I get reports through OK and the liberty movement that things are just astoundingly bad. You have sheriffs being arrested, town mayors, entire town infrastructures as far as local government goes, being arrested for narco trafficking, for money laundering. They seem to have been asked a question as the drug cartels do, between silver and lead, and they’ve chosen that silver. How bad is it and what does that mean for where America’s going right now?

TF: (0:07:30.1) Like you say, it’s plata o plomo, blood or silver, take your pick. What I tell people is the only difference between the Mexican government and our government is the Mexican government doesn’t care you know they’re corrupt, whereas ours pretends their not. This is far-reaching. Look at Eric Holder, the head of DoJ, was running guns through BATF. Border Patrol agents have been killed by weapons by them. Nobody’s ever prosecuted in the high-ups. Being here for 5 years on the ground, I’ve noticed it’s getting worse by the year. We’re getting more Mexican military incursions into AZ. 3 weeks ago, there were 7 bodies found approximately 10 miles west of me, all shot in the head, one decapitated. A couple days before that, 2 more bodies in the mountains, shot in the head. They war against each other for the prime drug routes. That’s what’s going on here right now. There’s so much dope coming through here. I’ll give you an example. Last week, myself and my dog put eyes on a camper for 2 hours. After 2 hours, I called Border Patrol, they came in. Maybe 150 yards from my front door, 560 pounds of dope inside that camper. The following day, about 150 yards to the east of my front door, that one was on the west, another 160 pounds of dope. It’s constant. It’s 24/7, and it’s not just dope. I think they’re sacrificing the pot so they can get the heroin and the meth across, which is worth thousands of times more than plain old marijuana. I’ve been out here, I’ve seen them coming across the border at night in ultra-lights, they look like hang-gliders with a Volkswagen motor on the back. They’re flying it over you with 800 pounds of dope on it. It’s not what the little box on the wall is telling people. We get Muslims coming through, Somalis, Chinese. There’s over 78 different nations coming through our border right now. The way the federal government fudges the numbers, I had a picture of a Somali on a trail camera, and I took it up into Tucson to show the higher ups, and they say haven’t you ever seen a dark-skinned Mexican? It’s like yeah, but that’s not a dark-skinned Mexican. That’s a straight up Somali. They go no, that’s a Mexican. They’re just classifying everyone as illegal aliens and not special interest aliens, which is the classification they give for people of terrorist-known countries. They’re not telling you what’s coming through the border, what we’re seeing. Everybody’s heard about the al-Qaeda, ISIS camps on the south side. I have people directly south of me watching 60 Muslim males that have been there for maybe 6 months now. Those Muslim males are 2.5 miles south of my front door. These people who are sympathetic to eliminating the problem, they’re Mexicans and they live on the south side, they will let us know when and where they move.

JVT: (0:12:09.9) So you’re actually getting support south of the border as well?

TF: Oh yeah. They’re basically good people. It’s a beautiful little town, I used to be able to go over there. I would go to the local pharmacia and get the meds for my med kits for the field, because they sell it in the store, the same stuff we have to go to a doctor and pay hundreds for, I can get over there for $20. I’d outfit my medkits with everything I need from over there, but I can’t go over there anymore. I don’t want to end up in a video. They’ve told me, if we show you where these guys live, what house they’re in, can you come over and take care of them for us? They don’t even trust their own military or police over there anymore. I say we would love to, but our government would lock us up forever, sorry but we can’t. It’s sad. There’s good people over there, they’re being held hostage in their own country.

JVT: (0:13:25.8) Maybe the silver lining is that we can find some unity amongst the good people at the end of this. Tim, tell us about. Obviously you have operations going on, you’re always looking for people to come help out. I assume that, anyway, just being part of the OK operations I’ve been part of. I know that can be a difficult task. Can you tell us about the response from the Patriot community, the people coming in, how long they usually spend with you? What does that look like for someone who wants to come and help, what does life look like on operation with you?

TF: The response has been great, especially in the past 2 months. There was an article that made the front page of the UK Daily Mail, with a documentary out there called Cartel Land, and a few other things. I’ve gotten probably 3 dozen more people wanting to come in. We vet everybody that comes through. We make everybody fill out an application on our website. First I tell people to go read our RoEs and SOPs, Rules of Engagement and Standard Operating Procedures. We tell people they need to read those, if you’re okay with them you can fill out the application. I always get lots of questions about why are you doing this or that, because those RoEs and SOPs. I let people know those RoEs and SOPs were developed by AZBR and friendlies within the federal government who want us to keep going and want us, they’re warning us of certain things you can and can’t do. Those things are put in the RoEs and SOPs, because they don’t want us prosecuted. Once you do that and fill out the application, if you say you’re military, we ask for a copy of your DD-214. We’ve had a lot of guys in the beginning who said they were Seal Team 6 and all this other stuff, so now we vet everybody. After that process, everybody goes through a background check. That does 2 things, first it makes everybody that comes out comfortable that we’ve done our due diligence with everybody, including ourselves, so they don’t have to sit there if you’re out here on the border in the middle of the night going who the hell is this guy sitting next to me? We’ve run background checks, everybody’s information is on file in a secure encrypted hard drive. It also makes Border Patrol more comfortable with us because we’ve done our due diligence. They know we’ve looked at everybody, so Border Patrol’s not going around saying who are these guys? As for operations, I’ll take the young bucks with a lot of gung-ho, I’ll beat them up going up and down the mountain, going after the scouts. The other guys who have been here and the older ones who don’t want any part of that, I’ll place them out on dope trails. If we can get into the blind spots and onto the dope trails, it normally takes them a day or two to figure out that we’re sitting there. They’ll come along the trail, a lot of times they’ll have ground scouts in front of their loads of dope, even though they have scouts up in the high points. Once they figure out we’re there, we force them out of their favorable terrain into less favorable terrain, terrain that’s better for Border Patrol. Our last op, we pushed 22 dope mules with 1600 pounds of dope, 53 illegals, and 4 cartel scouts, by denying access and pushing them where they don’t want to go. A lot of people when they come out have the impression that you will run headlong into them, that you’ll make the actual take down. They’re not that dumb. They’re like cockroaches, they try to get around you any way they can, they’d rather get around you then run into you. By denying them access to their most popular and favorable terrain, indirectly we push all kinds of stuff into Border Patrol.

JVT: (0:19:06.2) How dangerous is this situation? Obviously there’s always danger, whether it’s at Bundy Ranch with the possibility of the ATF firing on citizens. It seems like whenever you’re going on operation with OK or you guys, there’s always a certain amount of danger. How dangerous, it seems to me that dealing with the cartels who have such a violent history, it might be a little more dangerous than some people are used to, if they’ve just gone out and done political activism like Bundy Ranch or whatnot. There you’re actually facing down cold-blooded killers.

TF: (0:19:48.3) The interesting thing is down here, because we’re so close to the line. I can look out my window and see the fence. Because we’re that close, they know if they engage in a firefight that it’s going to spread too much bad, it’s going to bring too much attention. They don’t want that. Down here, it’s rare that you will see a weapon on somebody. These are their favorite areas to push and punch it through, if they bring too much heat to it, it will be shut down. Then they have to figure out where to go. In the 5 years I’ve been down here, I think we’ve run into 3 groups with weapons. Because we wear multi-cam and Border Patrol wears OD Green, they know we’re not Border Patrol, they know our rules are a little more lenient as in self-defense. They choose not to attempt anything. They know that the DoJ won’t prosecute them, so they just drop their weapons, okay whatever.

JVT: Hmm

TF: Never been in a firefight, never shot anybody. It’s the farther north you go where it starts getting hectic again. Then you’ve got the gangbangers coming out of the cities up north trying to rip off the dope loads and immigrants, illegals, for their money and raping them and everything. That’s where it starts getting iffy again, probably about 40-60 miles north of us.

JVT: (0:21:55.0) Wow

TF: Yeah. Closer to the big cities, it gets dangerous again. We’ve had 2 beheadings in 18 months in AZ. There’s not much media on that. It’s a totally different world down here. The one nice thing about AZ, it’s got its plusses and minuses. 80% of AZ’s border is public land. They can’t deny us access to go into these areas. In TX, 80% of the border is private land, that’s where you have to be really careful. The federal government has given the illegals more rights than citizens. You have the chance of a property owner trying to protect and defend his property, and you can be arrested. We’ve been told, we can be arrested for kidnapping because you’re impeding their progress from point A to point B. We get around that by offering them humanitarian aid when we stop them. Give them food and water, then Border Patrol used to go hey they’ve got their shoes off. Yep, we gave them medical aid, we’re checking their feet for blisters.

JVT: (0:23:36.3) With Cartel Land and some other documentaries in the last few years, how has the response been? Has it been evolving? Have you noticed that more citizens are coming around to understand how things are happening, or do people still not truly understand what’s happening?

TF: It peaks when something comes out, then falls back off again. The majority of the American people have a 3 day attention span. You can thank the way mainstream media covers things and social media and stuff like that. Yeah, when the UK Daily Mail came out, the headline article there, I was bombarded with requests for interviews, people asking how they could help, our donations to our organization since we’re all self-funded out of our own pockets, our donations spiked for a month, then fell right back off like they were before. It comes and goes. We just have to keep putting more media attention in there so people realize that it’s not just a one time event. It’s not just it happens only this weekend out of the year. No, it’s ongoing, 24/7.

JVT: (0:25:13.6) Last question. How is the response from other groups? There are other militia groups. I know you’re not a militia, you’re not NGO. Have you had response from the militia community, from other groups like OK? How has the support been among other groups that have similar mind on certain issues?

TF: We have about 4 or so different militia groups. There’s Arizona AP3. There’s 3 Up Arizona. There’s a couple militias in California and New York that make the trip out here. I have another op coming up shortly, and California is coming back out. They want to do something, but because their laws are so screwed up, they can’t do anything over there. So they make the drive over here, they’ll drive 10-12 hours to be here for 5-7 days, whatever they can do. The support from them is pretty good. You do get a lot of militias that are interested in helping, then when they see the application and RoEs, they say what the hell, I wouldn’t give that to the government, why would I give it to you? Well, you gotta cell phone and computer don’t you? They already know who you are. Being secret squirrel isn’t doing anything, we do everything out in the open because we’re not doing anything wrong. We’re abiding by all the laws. As citizens. That’s why we’ve been able to operate for 5 years, everything’s within the scope of the law. We’re out in the open. Our RoEs and SOPs are on our website for the public to see, for the federal government to see. Everyone can look at everything we do.

JVT: Tell us how people if they’re interested in getting more information, in applying and helping out, or even just a financial donation. What’s the best place to do that?

TF: (0:27:42.4) We have multiple spots. We’re on Facebook, AZBR. Because everyone’s on social media, we have to be too. We love the little thumbs up button. We also have a website, Arizonaborderrecon.org. There you’ll find all the info about us, there’s a volunteer section, a donate section. Everything’s in the open there. You want questions answered or anything, there’s an email address there. I’ll get it, I usually respond within 24 hours, depending on where I’m at and what I’m doing. We’re so legit that I’m a licensed corporation in AZ. We try to go as legit as possible, so there is no, the way the media portray militia and III% and OK and everybody else, oh my god they’re a bunch of right-wing white gun lunatics. That’s far from the point of what it is. We have Filipino guys, we’ve had Hispanics, blacks, women. It doesn’t matter. They still, when the media is out here, they’ll take select pictures and leave out the Hispanics and blacks and stuff like that.

JVT: Well I appreciate the work you’re doing. I’d love to have you back whenever you have news you need helping getting out. Thank you for coming on.

TF: I appreciate you having me on. Any time you want an update, give us a call back in December, I’ll have more news for you.

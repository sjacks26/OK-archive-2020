<p><strong>Jerry  W. Bunch:</strong></p>
<p>Testimonial:         ENEMY AT THE GATES<br/>
(a cursory analysis)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Is there an enemy at the gates? Oh, it’s much worse than that! The enemy is inside the gates. In fact, one of America’s greatest enemies happens to be the gate keeper and he has the gates wide open. Is he doing that on purpose? Duh!</p>
<p>Is Obama a natural born citizen of the US?</p>
<p>Does Obama love America, the flag, and the Republic for which it stands?</p>
<p>Well, to quote the outlaw Josey Wales; ‘Don’t piss down my back and then tell me it’s raining’.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">How about congress? Professional politicians, they are. Mostly lawyers. Not representatives of the people. They call themselves ‘law makers’. I have a big problem with that and so should you. They believe that they are under a mandate to make laws. The more laws they make, the better. The real truth is that we have too many federal laws now. They can’t even take one issue at a time and consider that issue as a bill. They are so busy that they have to add this and that to the bill in order to get the bill passed. They are no longer looking at the issue.  They are looking at a bill loaded with pork and compromise. This is done partly because they believe that they have to make some laws because they are law makers. Personally, I cannot justify the same mandate for production that I would require of a brick layer or an assembly line worker. How about you? I think that maybe they would be more valuable to this country if they would spend less time making new laws and spend a lot of time protecting and preserving the supreme law of the land; the Constitution.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">But these are, for the most part, corrupt individuals who work most arduously to protect and preserve their next election, not the Constitution. They are men and women with no back bone; full of self-interest and with no dutiful consciousness of the will of the people.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And then there is the judiciary; the venerable Supreme Court of the United States and the ultimate guardians of the Constitution. These are lifetime appointees, chosen for their honor, integrity, constitutional knowledge, loyalty, etc. Well, who can judge the supreme judges of the land? I say let them be judged, not by man, but by the Constitution itself. I say, according to the Constitution itself, they are perverters of the supreme law of the land and quite possibly traitors as well.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Now, all of the men and women within all three of the branches of US government swore an oath. I say that they have violated the oaths they took. I say that our government has suffered catastrophic failure over the last few decades.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Here is one last comment from my foxhole. At the end of every oath are the words ‘So Help Me God’. I ask you, What God are they referring to? Is it the Judeo-Christian God? Is it Allah, or Buddha, or Cali, etc.? Perhaps you are like a religious rooster and you say ‘any god will do’. I say, when the oaths were created, the oaths were directed to only one god; the Judeo-Christian God, Jehovah. I say that the foundations of this nation were built on the belief that there was only one true god and the rest were false gods. That leads up to the ultimate betrayal of the American people and that is the Christian churches. If it is indeed true that this nation was founded on Judeo-Christian principles (and essentially all founding documents and declarations from the founding fathers themselves bear that out), then how is it that the Christian influence which once guided our government has, not only eroded, but has been stricken from the very conscience of government.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I have to preach for a  moment here. When the Spirit of the Living God was banished from American government, the spirit of liberty was also cast out (for ‘Where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty’. Where were the churches as this was happening? Where were the pastors? Cowards they are! False protectors of their congregations and the American people are those who stand in the pulpits all across America and fail<br/>
to warn. And there are many today who go even further. They are actually taking an active part in this evil odyssey away from the eternal truth. Is this still ‘one nation under God’? They were commissioned by God Himself to be the true watch dogs of America. Judasgoats they are!! (end of sermon)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Why say all of these things? Because I believe that they are true and because I also took an oath and, within that oath, I swore to defend this nation against all enemies, both foreign and domestic. Gee, I think that was the very reason for the formation of the Oath Keepers! So I hope that I’m well received by every member of this true band of brothers.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">My military service began in March 1966 when I enlisted in the Air Force. I served as a ground surveillance radar operator. I served for 3 years, 9 months and 10 days. I was honorably discharged. I did tours in Texas, Iceland and Montana respectively. I was in civilian life for a few years and then joined the Army. I began as a microwave systems repairer and changed to a counterintelligence agent.  As an agent, I worked at the tactical level and at the strategic/national level.  At the tactical level, my initial duty was as a tactical agent at the platoon level. My next assignment was as the NCOIC of a military intelligence battalion S2. The next duty assignment was as the NCOIC of the Force Protection Section of the Division G2. My last assignment was at Fort Meade, MD, where I worked as the NCOIC of operations and investigations. After a year in that position, I worked as an offensive counterintelligence officer and ran double agent operations. I finished military service in December 1993.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I’m a Christian. I’m a vet. I’m a patriot. I’m a constitutionalist. I’m just all kind of things that put me on the ‘red list’. There is one other thing that distinguishes me and that I’m very proud of. I’m an Oath Keeper.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">My name is Jerry Bunch. I live in Mississippi (transplanted Texan). aka Yoda</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Stuart Sussman:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Testimonial: I am now 70 y/o but don’t be surprised as I do not feel it. I was a SP/4 medic, drafted 1965-67, Stationed in Ft. Lewis, Washington, Ft. Sam Houston medical, served Central Highlands, Pleiku Vietnam. Assigned to an Artillery Battery 105 Howitzer. My twin brother served with me for 90 days and general discharge for medical problems. My other brother was a door gunner and was wounded and received the purple heart. My other brother was a paratrooper in Germany. I was a SP/5 but was busted twice to SP/4 because I disobeyed an indirect order, and I would do it again. I really don’t like taking orders, especially if they are wrong ones. I was with the 6/29 Artillery temporary. 4th Division.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Alton G. Ambrose, Jr.:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Testimonial: I consider John Kerry a traitor to this country. He took the oath when he joined the Navy. I consider that oath to be binding until my dying breath. He has sold this country out in the name of a president and an administration that I feel is steadily trying to erode the very fabric of our society that so many of us have fought and died for. I served my country and always swelled with pride when I repeated that oath. It means as much to me now as it did the first time I took it.  This is my country and my blood will stain its ground before I will let it be taken away from me.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>William Bonadiman:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Testimonial: I don’t have uploaded pictures of myself (not important at this juncture) I am 58 years old and a contractor in California.  Note, I said California. If you want small business to go away and the highest taxes in the USA, live here. If you want to think of the Constitution as a 200 year old concept..live here.  If you want to elect illegal immigrants to public office…live here. If you want sanctuary cities… live here.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I can’t get a concealed weapons permit because I can’t demonstrate the need for one. I was shot at (nearly point blank) by (2) drug dealers and believe it or not, they missed. And I can’t carry??</p>
<p>I am joining Oath Keepers with the condition that a chapter is formed in California. bonadimanwater@hotmail.com</p>
<p>Let me know what I can do to help. And I don’t care if this is public access, I’m proud to be an American in the USA or what’s left of it.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>William Bonadiman</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Kevin:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Testimonial: Thank you for your presence in Ferguson, MO.  It was encouraging to see fellow legal Americans stepping up and exercising the Constitutional rights, legally, maturely and respectfully. It is time for more Americans to take back their legal rights to peacefully maintain order in times of crisis in a country that was meant to be run by all people,for all people.</p>
<p>Keeping doing what is right!</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Old Tanker:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Testimonial: I am a retired Army Senior NCO. I am a veteran of Desert Storm and proud of the soldiers that I had the honor to lead. I took the Oath then and I still feel that I am obligated to it.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">—————————————————————————————————————————————————————————</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Roy T:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Testimonial: 1983-87: Served 4 years US Navy, USS Carl Vinson, Operations Specialist, Petty Officer 2nd Class. Honorable Discharge. 11 years served State Police – early retirement. America is the best country in the world – but its foundation, the Constitution, has been dangerously weakened and needs to be protected and restored. I’d rather die in freedom than live in tyranny.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">May God give us all the strength, wisdom and protection needed to do so, and heal this land. 2 Chronicles 7:14</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">—————————————————————————————————————————————————————————</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>B. Waters:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Testimonial: I have taken three oaths in my life that will stand my test of time. Igave my heart to my wife, Karen, and swore to protect the constitution of the United States of America, and I have sworn my belief and love of Jesus Christ. I am not sure of the direction our Country is headed, I just know I don’t like where we are at now. So now I make public my oath, to protect our Country (Constitution) against all enemies, foreign and domestic.</p>

In their <a href="https://www.oathkeepers.org/pacific-patriot-network-articles-of-resolution-given-to-leadership-and-officials-in-harney-county/" target="_blank"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Articles of Resolution</span></a>, the Pacific Patriot Network, make the following claim:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Two witness have come forward and provided recorded eye witness accounts of the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), using drip torches, lighting fire along the boundary of the Hammond Ranch. One BLM crew started at the south end of the ranch and the second BLM crew started on the east side of the ranch creating a horseshoe of fire around the Hammond ranch. The Hammond’s responded with lighting back burns to prevent fire spread onto their ranch, protecting their private property. The witness was interview by Assistant United States Attorney (AUSA) Frank Papagni, Jr.. AUSA Papagni never called on this witness, nor in pre-trial discovery reported to the defense the existence of these witnesses.<br/>
Therefore;<br/>
Citizens for Constitutional Freedom request the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) conduct a criminal investigation into prosecutorial misconduct for unlawfully withholding eyewitness testimony which would have aided in the Hammond’s defense. The withholding of evidence and actions by US Attorney Amanda Marshal has further led to the violation of the Hammond’s 5th Amendment and 8th Amendment Constitutional Rights.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If this is true, Assistant US Attorney Frank Papagni, Jr. is guilty of criminal misconduct. He knew of these witnesses, (it is alleged), yet refused to divulge their existence to defense attorneys, as he is required by law to do. Had the Hammonds’ lawyers known of their existence, the outcome of the trial might have been different. US Attorney, as head of the US Attorney’s office in Oregon is equally culpable. The Hammonds were tried as terrorists, for God knows what reason, for setting backfires on their property on one instance, to protect their property, and for burning their fields, in another, the fire getting out of control and spreading onto the BLM land. Yet, the BLM has lost control of its controlled burns, burning private land, yet they shrug it off as collateral damage, with the private landowners receiving no compensation. Meanwhile, the BLM received a judgement of $400,000 from the Hammonds. To put it mildly, it is insane.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">US Attorney Amanda Marshall, an Obama appointee, is a piece of work. She resigned because of allegations by one of her Assistant Attorneys, that she was stalking him. You can find out her story <a href="http://theconservativetreehouse.com/2016/01/04/unbelievable-update-oregon-bundy-militia-standoff-the-federal-prosecutor-at-the-heart-of-the-hammond-family-problem/" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://theconservativetreehouse.com/2016/01/04/unbelievable-update-oregon-bundy-militia-standoff-the-federal-prosecutor-at-the-heart-of-the-hammond-family-problem/', 'here');" target="_blank"><span style="color: #0000ff;">here</span></a>, <a href="http://www.wweek.com/portland/blog-32962-federal_prosecutor_allegedly_stalked_by_us_attorney_amanda_marshall_was_under_armed_protection.html" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.wweek.com/portland/blog-32962-federal_prosecutor_allegedly_stalked_by_us_attorney_amanda_marshall_was_under_armed_protection.html', 'here');" target="_blank"><span style="color: #0000ff;">here</span></a> and <a href="http://www.oregonlive.com/portland/index.ssf/2012/01/oregons_top_federal_prosecutor.html" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.oregonlive.com/portland/index.ssf/2012/01/oregons_top_federal_prosecutor.html', 'here');" target="_blank"><span style="color: #0000ff;">here</span></a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Did the BLM and the Oregon US Attorney’s office conspire to railroad the Hammond family? It is time for a thorough investigation by the FBI. If the claims of criminal misconduct against Assistant US Attorney Papagni, Jr. are valid, he should be removed from his office and tried in court. If the claims are found to be valid, the convictions of Dwight and Steven Hammond should be overturned.</p>

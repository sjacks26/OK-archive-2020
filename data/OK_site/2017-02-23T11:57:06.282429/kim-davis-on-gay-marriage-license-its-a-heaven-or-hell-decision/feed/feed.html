<content:encoded>with respect, even the Bible says that “Everyone must submit to the governing authorities, because there is no authority that has not been established by God, so in Kim Davis’ case, I find her picking and choosing which passage of Scripture to obey. People will say, but only if the government is right and just. Well, Paul wrote that to the Christian church at Rome, I don’t suppose Rome was a righteous  authority, yet Paul tells us to obey. and Jesus tells us to render unto Caesar.
<p>To say that marriage is a religious institution means all those married by a justice of the peace are not married? Do we really want to alienate a very large number of people? Churches need to call it what is , matrimony. If  Kentucky had made accommodation for religious objections at the start of all this it would be one thing, but they didn’t. </p>
<p>And I think too, we must respect the right of religious liberty of some Christian churches who believe same-gender marriage is fine, and actually perform them- shall we then infringe no their right to practice their religion? By no means, either all religious beliefs arte respected under the 1st Amendment, or none are. So whatever you or I might think of a particular sect, denomination etc., as an Oath keeper, doesn’t that mean we  need to stand up for those people’s rights as well? Otherwise we are not upholding the Constitution, we are selectively applying it to protect only those we deem to be in the “right” church. Respectfully, Beowulf.</p>

<content:encoded>YES!<br/>
Separation of church and state. If, in her state appointment, she is unable to define her role within the parameter of existing law and live by her sworn duty as a servant of the people, for the people, while respecting co-present differences or diversity amongst the law respecting citizenry then she is incapable of performing her duty. Not all citizens of this nation and community she serves have the same relationship with deity that this public servant has, and thank goodness, or, we would be soley a church-state dependant on similar religious views and rules for governance. Instead, ours is a nation of tangible-physical-beings who must consider human differences and give allowance to their being different and allow it with respect and honor.<br/>
Forcing one’s personal or religious belief on others, with the goal being to promote and expect all people to believe, as this woman seems to expect of people in her jurisdiction, that “…God’s Law” and not the law of her community, her State or her Nation, should be the law. In such a world God alone or through God’s appointed representatives, laws for this nation should be made.<br/>
Kentucky County Clerk, Kim Davis is working for the wrong community, the wrong county, the wrong state and, finally, the wrong country and perhaps living in the wrong century. She would fit in really well as the County Clerk in the 12th Century while serving in the employment of the Catholic Church where she could be representing  her God as He proclaimed the Holy Inquisition and vetted out the “Unworthies” and play a role in hastening their exit from this world so they can receive their just rewards in the next world,  sooner than later.

<content:encoded>Kim Davis is not following the United States Constitution and so I don’t understand why OathKeepers would offer her protection when the mission is to protect Our Constitution.<br/>
She is refusing to resect our Constitution as interpreted by a very conservative SCOTUS.<br/>
She is denying people straight and non-straight the right to marry the one they love.<br/>
Big mistake to protect her I believe. It’s a black eye for the OathKeepers just as it would have<br/>
been wrong to protect George Wallace stand in the school house door.

<content:encoded>If you can’t look between your legs and see what sex you are, and don’t understand the definition of marriage, you will never understand any explanation given by anybody here. 
<p>You appear to be a smart person, you do not need to play this game. </p>
<p>What exactly is a “Chariot of Fire”?  </p>
<p>What would an ancient Egyption call an airplane? </p>
<p>In other words, because homosexuals don’t know what to call the legal bond between two consenting adults of the same sex, that does not give authority to changing the definition of marriage does it? </p>
<p>So all you homosexuals and homosexual sympathizers figure out the new term, adopt it, lobby it, and quit disrespecting the good people of this country who can recognize a penis from a vagina. The same people who really don’t have a problem with your sexual preferences but hold dear the relationship of a man and woman, the most supreme human relationship on the planet. Without which you would not be here.</p>

GS: In E Germany, which was not very helpful for the economy, which was already going down.

SR: So the Russians forced you to spend more money on the military.

GS: Absolutely. Just take this part over from Romania. Everyone had to increase anyway, but

SR: What year was this?

GS: This was in the 80s, mid 80s, beginning 80s. Beginning 80s it was clear what was going on.

SR: What happened to Romania?

GS: Romania had the worst economy in the countries in E Europe. They also had the increase. Ceaușescu couldn’t do this economically. He said no, I’m peaceful, I will not increase our military. The reason was it was not possible for him. The economy was completely broke. He was never a peacemaker, but he didn’t have the money to do this.

SR: So the Russians couldn’t get blood out of a rock basically.

GS: Yes. There was no way.

SR: So they turned to you, to squeeze you guys.

GS: It was the only way. It was getting worse. The border from E Germany to W Germany was completely closed. No one could go.

SR: What happened if you tried to cross?

GS: There was mines, you could not cross.

SR: You’d be shot.

GS: You just died. You were shot. There was no way to go through this. There was another way, you could go via through the border to Austria, which wasn’t that closed. The same between the Czech and W Germany. A lot of people used this to have a better life. Most of us tried to have a better life. This happened more and more, because the situation was getting worse. I would say 90% of people weren’t happy with the party and the situation. 

SR: How poor were the people?

GS: This was completely different. What you need to live, your food and house and apartment, all this was extremely cheap. But it was all you had. Everything else was extremely expensive and hard to get. Oranges, you could get them at Christmas. Bananas, you could get them at Christmas. Not the rest of the year. (0:03:16.6) This was the same everywhere. You have no problems to eat, but that was all you had. It was going down.

SR: Kept getting worse all the time. You were saying that because of the close proximity to W Germany, and you had relatives on the other side, you could see what was going on over there.

GS: There was a huge difference between E Germany and the other states in E Europe. Germany was divided, families were on both sides of the border. Overnight, the border closed. We had TV. E Germany was about 300 miles wide, so you could get TV anywhere from Germany, and it was the same language of course. So we had TV, radio, everything from W Germany, so you knew what was going on. And W Germany knew what was going on in the E. They could see the TV, and they could visit family members.

SR: So you learned about what was going on.

GS: W Germany claimed in their constitution that W Germany is Germany, and all other parts belong still to Germany. So that means that me as a citizen of E Germany, I was also a citizen of W Germany. When someone crossed the border, he was still home. It was completely different for other countries. 

SR: So you in some sense had a divided loyalty.

GS: It was not really opposition against the party at this time. It started in beginning of 1989 in a church in Leipzig. Normally, no one went to church in E Germany without some older guys or artists. They were there in the church, in the middle of downtown Leipzig. They started in January 89. After the church, always Monday 7pm, when they left the church, they walked over the highway, peaceful, in the beginning 80, later 100. Everyone stopped, let them go.

SR: What did they march for?

GS: It was just quiet, just march around downtown on the street. No sign, nothing. Just peaceful, came from church. Everyone knows what it means. The party tried to look for people, fire them, put pressure.

SR: Take their names down.

GS: The normal stuff, yeah.

SR: (0:06:52.6) When you say everyone knew what it meant, what did it mean?

GS: The situation in E Germany was pretty clear. Everyone knows, economy is going down. The party says we are the biggest, the greatest, it is not the real how life really is.

SR: You knew it was a lie.

GS: Everyone knew it. When the guys came from the church and walked over the street in the group, without any route, it was hard to say anything. All they could say was you guys have to get off the street, go on the side. It was very clever. Leipzig had 560,000 at this time. Shortly later, everyone knew something’s going on on Monday. Every Monday, they wait outside the church to watch what’s going on. Some of them joined them, and it grew. The party was not expecting this to grow up, but it did. And it was too late to stop them. I got in trouble because I was not exactly what the party expected of me. But there was nothing they could do. Then in June.

SR: So you joined the march?

GS: Later. Not at this time (0:08:34.2). In June, I got the order to go to my boss, the commander of the army in the HQ. It was the same lt. col. Who later said we will not obey this order. This was the security of the party.

SR: The secret police, stasi.

GS: Yeah. They were there, also in the army. My lt. general told me you have to follow this command. He told them I will see evidence in 5 days or the lt. col. Will be back in the office. It was Monday, Friday I was back in the office.

SR: So they took you

GS: I got arrested. They could not find anything. This was interesting. The lt. general commander of the army said you have 5 days, you bring evidence and put it on my desk, if not my lt. colonel is back in the office. I was back in the office on Friday.

SR: Why do you think that happened?

GS: (0:09:57.8) It would not happen 10 years before.

SR: You would have disappeared 10 years before.

GS: Same as the father of my boss. I would just disappear. But the army changed completely over that time. Everyone knew what’s going on. It was not possible to say, when you ask, where’s this lt. colonel he’s not here where is he? 10 years before, you wouldn’t have asked. In my time, you ask.

SR: Is it because everyone knew the truth and they saw the reality of the lie? Is that why?

GS: Yes this is why. And the party wasn’t as sure, said don’t overdo it, be careful of the army. The army was the real power in E Germany.

SR: So they started to worry about the army.

GS: Yes. They knew what happens. In my position, in the HQ of the army, every 6 months, the security police has to sign a document saying that I could do my job. 

SR: They controlled

GS: Absolute control. So I came back, and later I joined the Monday march.

SR: Did they ever tell you why they arrested you?

GS: (0:11:27.1) No. They just. Actually, I was under control because of my job in the army. I knew this, this was normal. They had a problem with me because I blocked what the party tried to do. Because they made me the secretary of this part of the party. It’s always the same. I was the commandant of this part. It’s a kind of control. When you’re the secretary, someone higher in the party can tell you what you have to do, and you do it. I did not. The easiest way was to find something or manipulate something to say he is something against security or the army or the party. Then you have a reason to put you away.

SR: A pretext to arrest you.

GS: They tried to find a reason. It was shortly before, they had to go out in the field. One guy told me that I should make a detour before and look in our apartment before you leave. I did, and I arrested 5 guys from the secret police. I had my gun with me, that was completely unusual in E Germany. I called the police. They already knew, the cover was blown. Everyone knows it. They broke in the apartment of a high ranking officer of the army, and he was not there. They had to find anything just to say we are right, we had to do this. They couldn’t find anything. They said okay, we arrest him and we have time to find something. They did not. It was 5 days, you cannot manipulate anything in 5 days. It’s not possible. 

SR: So the pressure from the general forced them to do that. They were concerned about not doing what he said.
 GS: And the army changed. 

SR: You were in an infantry unit, correct?

GS: Yes

SR: You also served part of your time in the special forces.

GS: The last year or so. It was my decision.

SR: What happened next?

GS: Next, they released. Every Monday in Leipzig [garbled]. In the beginning of the year 100, then more and more. In October, the last Monday in October, there were 75k in the city. The population of the city was 540k. The whole population of E Germany was only 16million. 75k on Monday were on the street.

SR: You were there with them?

GS: Yes. It was more every Monday

<content:encoded>For those of you who value honor, duty, country and have sworn to uphold and defend, your decision should be a no brainer.  NO I will not follow that illegal order.
<p>You have been forewarned that there will be no more Free Waco’s.  The American people are not your enemies.  Don’t make them such!  There are many of us out here who were once members of the same community that you now reside in, (Special Operations) we know your tactics and have experience using them too.  Don’t make us use them against you and yours.  When the time comes and it will come, join your American brothers, it is the honorable action, the only action that you can take.</p>

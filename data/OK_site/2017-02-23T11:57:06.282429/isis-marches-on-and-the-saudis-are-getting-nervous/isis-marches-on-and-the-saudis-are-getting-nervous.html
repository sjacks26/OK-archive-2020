<h3><span style="font-size:16px;"><strong>Destroying Iraq’s Cultural Heritage</strong></span></h3>
<p><span style="font-size:12px;"><strong>The fundamentalist retro-gang  that has conquered Northern Iraq has decided it needs to go Taliban on  cultural monuments it disapproves of.</strong> One of the most recent outrages was the <a href="http://english.alarabiya.net/en/News/middle-east/2014/07/25/ISIS-destroys-tombs-of-two-prophets-in-Mosul.html" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://english.alarabiya.net/en/News/middle-east/2014/07/25/ISIS-destroys-tombs-of-two-prophets-in-Mosul.html', 'destruction of the tomb of Yunus');" target="_blank">destruction of the tomb of Yunus</a>,  better known in the West as the prophet Jonah (yes, the biblical one  who spent some time in the belly of a whale). Jonah is one of the  prophets revered by both Christians and Muslims, so the motivation is  not entirely clear. However, this is by far not the only ancient  religious site ISIS has destroyed in the vicinity of Mosul. Reportedly  the group has by now destroyed some 30 ancient shrines, churches,  mosques and Hussainiyas in the area of Mosul alone. Oddly, this included  at least four Sunni mosques, so there appears to be a certain degree of  arbitrariness to these actions. Yazidi monuments are of course also on  the list of things ISIS destroys whenever an occasion presents itself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:12px;"><strong>In short, the group is not only  killing people that don’t conform to its harsh version of Islam, it is  also trying to erase all traces of their history and culture. </strong>It  cares not one whit how old or unique these buildings and monuments are.  For instance, the mosque of Yunus was built on an archeological site  the oldest parts of which date back to the 8<sup>th</sup> century BC. In  short, there are buildings in Iraq that have survived 2,800 years of  upheaval and strife, but they haven’t survived the coming of ISIS.  Apparently ISIS considers all the shrines and mosques it destroys  “places of apostasy”. In the course of its rampage it has also burned  the books of the Diyala province’s library, so reading is apparently a  no-no for ISIS as well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:12px;">It should be noted that this rabid  interpretation of Sunni Islam is quite a retrogression from Islam as it  was originally practiced in the centuries after its founding. The schism  between Shi’ites and Sunnites of course goes back almost to the  beginning of the Muslim religion. However, although the Muslim rulers of  old were expansionist and not at all averse to warfare, were actually  relatively tolerant of members of other religions living on their lands.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:12px;">A tiny part of the traditions  established at the time are even preserved by ISIS in a way. It  reportedly gives Christians living in the areas of Iraq and Syria it  controls the choice between conversion, paying the jizya tax, or death.  The payment of this special tax was historically actually not regarded  as an injustice, but was rather seen as an attempt to balance the Muslim  zakat tax and so to speak create a level playing field. Of course for  ISIS it is just another source of revenue.</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size:12px;">It is quite ironic that one of the main financial backers of ISIS <a href="http://en.ria.ru/world/20140804/191716849/Saudi-Arabia-Seeks-to-Protect-Mecca-after-ISIS-Destroys-Iraqi.html" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://en.ria.ru/world/20140804/191716849/Saudi-Arabia-Seeks-to-Protect-Mecca-after-ISIS-Destroys-Iraqi.html', 'is finally getting worried');" target="_blank">is finally getting worried</a> a bit in light of all these events:</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-size:12px;"><strong><em>“Saudi  Arabia is seeking help from Pakistan and Egypt to protect its borders  and religious sites from attacks by the Islamic State (IS), formerly  known as the Islamic State of Iraq and Greater Syria (ISIS), the  International Business Times reported.</em></strong></span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-size:12px;"><strong><em>“Saudi  Arabia is seeking help from Pakistan and Egypt to protect its borders  and religious sites from attacks by the Islamic State (IS), formerly  known as the Islamic State of Iraq and Greater Syria (ISIS), the  International Business Times reported.</em></strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:12px;">“The kingdom is calling in favors from Egypt and Pakistan. <strong><em>No  one is certain what ISIS has planned, but it’s clear a group like this  will target Mecca if it can. We expect them to run out of steam, but no  one is taking any chances,”</em></strong> the International Business  Times wrote Sunday citing an adviser to the Saudi government. The  jihadist group started a large-scale offensive against Iraq’s Shiite  government led by Nouri Maliki in June, aiming to seize Baghdad.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:12px;">Militants have destroyed several  prominent religious sites in the Iraqi city of Mosul, some 400  kilometers (nearly 250 miles) north of Baghdad, over the past weeks. <strong><em>The  group defended their actions by saying, “The demolition of structures  erected above graves is a matter of great religious clarity,”</em></strong> according to Agence France-Presse.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:12px;"><strong><em>Among the levelled sites  were some of the main mosques, the Nabi Yunus shrine (Tomb of Jonah) and  a shrine to The Prophet Seth. Eleven sites of Christian worship have  been destroyed, including the Chaldean archdiocese, as well as the  Diyala Province Library, where approximately 1,500 books were burnt.</em></strong></span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-size:12px;">(emphasis added)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-size: 12px;">We would add to this that there is no  proof that the Saudi government has done anything beyond tolerating that  rich private Saudi citizens supported ISIS with donations, but let us  apply some logical thinking here. This is an army that has grown from an  “estimated 2,000 fighters” to “no-one knows how many fighters”  practically overnight. As we have pointed out previously, it has quite a  lot of sophisticated equipment at its disposal as well. Not only  military equipment, but also things like construction machinery. It runs  its own oil and gas fields and even has a kind of propaganda ministry  capable of regularly putting out slickly produced recruitment videos.  When it was recently reported that the group has taken over the Mosul  dam, it was revealed that there are also numerous engineers in its ranks  who have previously helped with employing water as a weapon to help its  war effort (see also below).</span></span></p>

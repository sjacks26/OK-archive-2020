<p><span style="font-weight: normal;">When did our returning veterans become a “threat” to local, state and <span class="IL_AD" id="IL_AD8">federal law</span> enforcement, so much so that they are specifically highlighted by local authorities? </span></p>
<p><em>In a chilling story entitled <a href="http://fox59.com/2014/05/12/armed-for-war-local-police-tote-pentagon-surplus/#axzz31isc0kux" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://fox59.com/2014/05/12/armed-for-war-local-police-tote-pentagon-surplus/#axzz31isc0kux', 'Armed for War: Pentagon surplus gives local police an edge');" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Armed for War: Pentagon surplus gives local police an edge</a>,  we learn how a Mine Resistant Vehicle (MRAP) which was once used during  the occupation of Afghanistan will now be “patrolling the streets of  central Indiana,” according to the <span class="IL_AD" id="IL_AD4">report</span>.</em></p>
<p><em>Sgt. Dan Downing of the Morgan County Sheriff’s Department states, “When  I first started we really didn’t have the violence that we see today,”  adding, “The weaponry is totally different now that it was in the  beginning of my career, plus, you have <span class="IL_AD" id="IL_AD10">a lot of</span> people who are coming out of the <span class="IL_AD" id="IL_AD5">military</span> that have the ability and knowledge to build IEDs and to defeat law enforcement techniques.” (<a href="http://www.infowars.com/police-now-armed-for-war-against-returning-veterans/" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.infowars.com/police-now-armed-for-war-against-returning-veterans/', 'Source');" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Source</a>)</em></p>
<p>Downing is admitting that the local police are specifically citing  returning veterans as a partial reason for the militarization of local  police around the country and the need for battlefield equipment to be  on the streets of America.</p>

Just a month later, the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/14/us/14explorers.html" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/14/us/14explorers.html', 'New York Times reported');" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">New York Times reported</a> on how Boy Scout Explorers were being trained by the DHS to kill “disgruntled Iraq war veterans” in terrorist drills.</p>
<p>The FBI has also repeatedly <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB123992665198727459.html" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://online.wsj.com/article/SB123992665198727459.html', 'characterized returning veterans');" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">characterized returning veterans</a> from Iraq and Afghanistan as a major domestic terrorist threat.</p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: normal;">DHS, FBI, local authorities, are all  attempting to portray returning war veterans as “dangerous” to Americans  and to the US, yet these are the very people that put their lives on  the line when they joined the military, willing to sacrifice their lives to defend America and protect the citizens of the United States of America.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: normal;">Below is the most likely reason that there is a concentrated, organized and strategic effort to <span class="IL_AD" id="IL_AD3">cast</span> veterans as a “domestic terrorist threat.”</span><br/>
<span style="font-weight: normal;"><br/>
</span></p>
<blockquote class="tr_bq"><p>The wordings of the current <a href="http://www.history.army.mil/html/faq/oaths.html" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.history.army.mil/html/faq/oaths.html', 'oath of enlistment and oath for commissioned officers');" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">oath of enlistment and oath for commissioned officers</a> are as follows:</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq"><p>“I, _____, do solemnly swear (or affirm) that <em>I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic</em>;  that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same; and that I will  obey the orders of the President of the United States and the orders of  the officers appointed over me, according to regulations and the  Uniform <span class="IL_AD" id="IL_AD7">Code</span> of Military Justice. So help me God.” (Title 10, US Code; Act of 5 May 1960 replacing the wording first adopted in 1789, with amendment effective 5 October 1962).</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq"><p>“I, _____ (SSAN), having been appointed an officer in the <span class="IL_AD" id="IL_AD6">Army</span> of the United States, as indicated above in the grade of _____ do  solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will support and defend the  Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and  domestic, that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same; that I  take this obligation freely, without any mental reservation or purpose  of evasion; and that I will well and faithfully discharge the duties of  the office upon which I am about to enter; So help me God.” (DA Form 71,  1 August 1959, for officers.)</p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: normal;">Constitutional rights are being  violated by the US government at every turn, from the right to free  speech, freedom of religion and free press, to the right to bear arms,  to the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/fourth_amendment" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/fourth_amendment', 'Fourth Amentment');" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Fourth Amentment</a>,  which states “The right of the people to be secure in their persons,  houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures,  shall not be violated, and no warrants shall issue, but upon probable  cause, supported by oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the  place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: normal;">Examples are shown every day of these  and other constitutional rights being violated by our very own  government. Rights that veterans, while serving, swore to defend, and  the majority will continue to defend to their dying day, whether still  serving or not.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: normal;">This does not make them terrorist threats, but rather our last <span class="IL_AD" id="IL_AD1">line of defense</span> against a tyrannical dictatorship. Fully trained in combat, knowledgeable of how <span class="IL_AD" id="IL_AD2">to overcome</span> the enemy and sworn to defend the constitution from enemies both foreign AND domestic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: normal;">In a nutshell, that is why the US  government, with full complicity by the mainstream media, are attempting  to disarm veterans, and convince the general public they are dangerous  to America.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: normal;">They are dangerous, not to citizens,  but to a regime being run more like a dictatorship and that is why they  have become public enemy <span class="IL_AD" id="IL_AD9">number one</span> in the eyes of the US federal government.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: normal;">The government is attacking veterans  because the Feds are preparing for insurrection and a possible  revolution against the tyranny being evidenced on a daily and weekly  basis by the government unchecked by Congress, and who better to take  out of the battle than those that could defeat the tyrants and fight for  our liberties and win?</span></p>

<content:encoded>Hello from Missouri,
<p>I encourage all USA patriots to do all they can to spread the Oath Keepers “Ten Orders We Will Not Obey” message. We, the People need to counter the indoctrination all of us are bombarded with our entire life telling us that we must blindly obey the messages and orders from those lording over us. These modern-day overlords to be obeyed include all levels of governance along with moneyed interests and their associations, organizations and, increasingly, monolithic corporations. </p>
<p>The complexity of that opposing the Founder’s creation and our freedom assists the tyrant’s ability to impose the greedy self-centered will of a few upon the many. By promulgating the Oath Keeper’s “Ten Orders” credo we remove part of and, hopefully all, of the enforcement arms of the tyrannical elite to force us to obey unAmerican demands.</p>
<p>Do what you can to assist the cause fellow freedom fighters. Tyranny is loose upon the land and We, the People must fight back against those wanting to place us in a serf-like condition. I know that the Founders and those who stood behind them are smiling upon our efforts.</p>

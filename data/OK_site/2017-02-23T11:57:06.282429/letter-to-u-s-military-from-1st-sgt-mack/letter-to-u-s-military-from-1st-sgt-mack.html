<p>(The below letter comes from an old American Army Airborne warrior, 1st Sgt. Mack (just “1st Sgt.” to us), who is very well respected by all here at Oath Keepers.  I asked him to write what he would want to say to active duty military and current serving federal LEOs (many of whom are military veterans) in regards to possible orders to “drop the hammer” on Ammon Bundy and his followers at the occupation of the Malheur Wildlife Refuge in Oregon.  This is what he wrote – Stewart Rhodes):</p>
<p>We would implore you, no we would beseech you, not to step over a line that there is no coming back across.  You must not allow yourselves to disregard your own moral values.</p>
<div>
<p>There is no job, no amount of money, no position that is worth risking the loss of one American citizens life if you choose to violate your oaths.</p>
<p>The American people are NOT terrorists, they are NOT insurgents, they are NOT the enemies from a foreign land, they are citizens, and as citizens they are GUARANTEED rights by the Constitution that you swore to uphold and defend.  Yes, they make mistakes, they make foolish decisions, they become frustrated and often feel they have lost their voice.</p>
<p>That does NOT make them enemies.  You, as military personnel and government employees have a Sworn Duty to uphold their rights and protect them.   And you have the ability to restore their voices, to ensure that they are heard.  You do not have the right, legal or otherwise, to silence them.  They have the right to freedom, liberty, and LIFE.</p>
<p>So again I ask that you stop and consider every consequence of any action that you may take going forward from this point.</p>
<p>Please stop and think what your answer would be when asked by your children, your parents, brother and sisters, or friends, “Why did you take part in action that was illegal, that led to the deaths of American citizens?”  Or “why did you allow yourselves to disregard the rights of those same people?”  Will you be able to look them in the eye? will you be able to merely say “I was just following orders?”  Because if you think you could, you do not belong in the position you are in.  And you should probably seek the advice of your family and friends NOW.</p>
<p>If you partake in any action that violates the Constitution, that leads to the death or destruction of American rights, liberties or lives, you will be held accountable by those same citizens. You have the ability to speak up for them,  I urge you to do so.</p>
<p>It is your Duty not to follow any order that is illegal.</p>
<p>Do not become the very enemy that you swore to defend this nation against, as you would be judged and treated just as that – an enemy of your own people.</p>
<p>1st Sgt.</p>
<p>US Army Ret.</p>

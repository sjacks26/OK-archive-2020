<p>Bloodthirsty Daesh Islamists posted notes through the doors of dozens of random neighbours in several cities across Sweden, including the capital Stockholm, threatening to murder “non-believers” in a terrifying campaign of violence.</p>
<p>Sweden is now on lockdown after the chilling letters pledged to behead innocent civilians and then “bomb your rotten corpses afterwards”.</p>
</div>
<div>Intelligence officials confirmed they are investigating the horrifying threats – which were signed by “ISIS” – as a state of fear gripped the nation.The notes, written in Swedish, order people to convert to Islam or pay a religious tax, known as the jizya, warning that the<strong> police “will not save you from being murdered”. </strong></div>

<p>An image of the chilling message was posted on Facebook by one of the recipients.</p>
<p>Swedish police said they were posted through residents’ doors in a number of cities including Ronneby, Sigtuna, Västerås and the capital Stockholm, earlier this week.</p>
<p>Local news outlets reported two Muslim asylum seekers of Iraqi origin – one in Ronneby and one in Vstroes – were amongst the recipients of the cruel letter.</p>
<p>Sigtuna police chief Emile Anderson said officers were unsure whether or not the threats contained in the messages were real, but said they were taking them seriously.</p>
<p>He added officials from the <strong>Swedish intelligence service Säpo are investigating the incident,</strong> according to RT Arabic.</p>
<p>We are sure of course that these were all thoroughly-vetted “refugees” and this could never happen in America.</p>

<p>NOTE FROM STEWART RHODES:</p>
<p>So, the Swedes are now fully reaping what they have sowed, with all their politically correct, self-loathing, multi-culturalist suicide by Islamist immigration, coupled with their institutionalized self-emasculation.  Sad thing is, unless and until the Swedes, as a people, rediscover their own Viking heritage and spirit, the ISIS/Daesh (they hate being called that, so let’s call them that) terrorists are right.   Wimpy Swedes, who are conditioned to just give the poor misunderstood and oppressed terrorists hugs and agape love, are truly incompetent and incapable of even saving their own lives if/when attacked in their own homes.    In just a few generations of girly-man inducing social conditioning, they have gone from a land of Swedish Vikings to a land of Swedish metrosexual weenies:</p>

<p>What the hell happened to Sweden?    This video by a an immigrant from the war-torn Balkans, now living in Sweden, explains:</p>

<p> </p>
<p>Talk about Stockholm syndrome!  Such a people, if they will not resist and fight back, if they will not recognize the superiority of Western Civilization and discover the will to defend it, will indeed end up either converting, submitting, or being exterminated.</p>
<div class="ctx_content p402_premium">
<p>And, as the ISIS psychopaths also correctly point out, the police will NOT be able to save Swedes targeted for head-chopping home invasion.   Just as we have seen over and over, all over the world, the police will <em>never</em> be there to stop an attack.  They can only respond to clean up the mess afterwards.   That is how it was in Paris.  That is how it was in San Bernardino.   And that is how it will be in the living rooms of the Swedish homes targeted for invasion and decapitation.   And those targeted will lose their heads unless the Swedes become what the once were:  A warrior culture.</p>
</div>
<p>I have read some Western intellectuals wring their hands and ask “how do you defend the West against Jihadists who’s battle cry is ‘we love death more than you love life’ because they expect seventy virgins in paradise after dying in Jihad?”    The answer is the Viking battle cry of “Til Valhal!” (“To Valhalla,” or sometimes expressed among U.S.soldiers and Marines as  “until Valhalla”), as heard in this stirring clip of Norwegian soldiers in Afghanistan:</p>
<p><iframe allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GxOSqSUgNzE" width="560"></iframe></p>

<p>the essence of the warrior ethic is to embrace your own mortality (we all die) and to resolve that dying in battle, defending the good against evil, is a good, honorable, way to go.   Of course, it is best to send the Jihadist off to “paradise” alone with a well placed round to the brain-pan, if you can (as Patton put it, <strong>“</strong>No dumb bastard ever won a war by going out and dying for his country. He won it by making some other dumb bastard die for his country.”) but the prerequisite for a free people is the conviction that there are worse things than death.   Hence the historic American grunt’s battle cry of “Death before dishonor!”   Or, as our Founders put it, “Liberty or death!”</p>
<p>As easy as it is to make fun of what Sweden, as a whole, has become, we must acknowledge that there are still some warriors in Sweden, as is clear from this video of Swedish soldiers in Afghanistan:</p>
<p><iframe allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9o3ONlhas7Q" width="420"></iframe></p>
<p>Yes, there are still a smattering of warrior “sheepdogs” among them, but the problem is that the great bulk of their population has been turned into a nation of sheep, just ripe for the slaughter (much like the French, the British, the Danes, etc.).</p>
<div class="ctx_content p402_premium">
<p>Now, lest we Americans get too high and mighty while laughing into our sleeves at the wimpy Europeans, let’s reflect on the servile, passive, sheepish mind-set of millions of our fellow Americans, who are also being intentionally conditioned, from grade school on, to not even try to fight back, to submit and comply, to be intentionally incompetent and incapable of saving their own lives, and to be self-loathing relativists who think their own culture is evil and deserves to die.  Just as in Europe, they are taught that nothing is worth fighting for, and nothing is worth risking death for, so they should just call 9-11, cower in a corner or go into a fetal position on the floor under a table, and hope a “sheepdog” cop or soldier get’s there in time to save the sheep (which they won’t).  And, of course, we Americans are told by our government that the only answer is to give up our guns, our privacy, our Bill of Rights, and our self-respect, and to become even more sheepish.  Remember, a nation of sheep begets a government of wolves.   And that is the goal of the political elite in this nation.</p>
</div>
<p>The proper response to such threats of “convert or lose you head” is not for the people to go on “lock down” and cower in fear in their homes.  The proper response is cold-rage, indignation, and then an eagerness to close with and destroy the enemy.  The proper response is to arm yourselves, steel your nerves, and prepare for battle.</p>
<div class="ctx_content p402_premium">
<p>I thank God I live in Montana, where the response from most of my neighbors to such notices tacked to their door would be to spit a bit of chew in the snow, smile, and say “bring it, boy” (and that goes for the women too!).   There would be some ISIS heads mounted on the wall above the mantle next to the trophy bucks, and some nice, new brain-tanned ISIS skin boots and belts given as gifts for Christmas (just kidding, of course – though I am not sure some of my neighbors are).</p>
<p>Here in rural Montana, where police response times can be up to 45 minutes, as in most of rural America, the American frontier warrior spirit is alive and well.   But we need to assist our city cousins in rediscovering that same human spirit of love of country, love of family, and love of friend and neighbor that is the heart and soul of courage, and the conviction that some things are worth fighting for and even dying for, and that there are worse things than death, such as submission, slavery, and failing to defend Western Civilization.</p>
<p>We need to get away from the flawed concept of a few “sheepdogs” who unsuccessfully attempt to guard a nation of sheep.  Frankly, we need to take the “sheepdog” meme out back and put a bullet in its head and bury it, because <em>this was not meant to be a nation of sheep</em>, guarded by a few “sheepdogs.”  Instead, we need to revitalize the spirit the Founding Generation, the spirit of the Minutemen, where it was recognized that in a free Republic, it is the people themselves, as the militia, who are the only true “first responders,” and each man lived by the creed that <em>every</em> citizen is also a soldier, and each has a duty to answer the hue and the cry, with rifle in hand, and go toward the sound of the guns.  A nation of riflemen.  A nation of warriors.  That is what we were meant to be.</p>
</div>
<p>As gun writer Kenneth Royce (writing as “Boston Tea Party”) put it, “Liberty is a man of war, and we’re all the crew.”  it is not a luxury liner.  There are no passengers.</p>
<p>I sincerely hope the Swedes will now wake up from the PC trance they have been under, and stand in defense of the West.   And I sincerely hope we can convince our fellow Americans to do the same.  The West is worth defending.  Liberty is worth defending.  Our homes and our families are worth defending.   And our spirit needs to be that of Isaiah, when he said:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong><span class="text Isa-6-8" id="en-NIV-17778">Then I heard the voice of the Lord saying, “Whom shall I send? And who will go for us?”</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span class="text Isa-6-8">And I said, “Here am I. Send me!” Isaiah 6:8</span></strong></p>
<p> </p></blockquote>
<p>Or, as 19th Century American slang put it, “I’m your huckleberry.”  Bring it ISIS/Daesh.  We look forward to it.</p>
<p>Till Valhalla!</p>

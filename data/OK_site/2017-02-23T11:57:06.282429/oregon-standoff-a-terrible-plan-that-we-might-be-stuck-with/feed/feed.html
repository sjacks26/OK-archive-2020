<content:encoded>Yes sir make no mistake another Waco will not be tolerated period any deadly  attack by the government is unacceptable and will cause a civil war. Everyone involved and on the Ground in Oregon needs to step back take a deep breath. End this peacefully the hell that will follow a deadly attack on these patriots this country or world has never seen. I have said this many many times to my children and grandchildren this country was founded in blood and will be destroyed in blood thus rebuilt or restored in blood. If this starts the preverbal S H T F so be it but we must all stand as one and win because their is to much at stake to lose. With that said get your heads out of the sand and get ready for the fight of biblical proportions.

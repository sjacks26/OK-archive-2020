Title screen: Daily Press Breifing [sic] From The Malheur Refuge PPN and CFCF

BC: I’m founder of the PPN, president of III% Idaho. Behind me is the rest of our founders, they’ll speak soon. We’re here to establish a security buffer between the gentlemen at the refuge, the community citizens, and law enforcement. We’re gonna start negotiating with law enforcement in town, including FBI, the Sheriffs, as well as at the Refuge. As you can see, we’ve established our security perimeter, when we rolled up. This is how we’ll doing things while we’re in town here. Any questions for me?

Reporter: How is this a de-escalation? (0:00:56.5) Someone said this is de-escalating. It’s hard to see that perception from people walking around.

BC: I’m gonna refer that to [can’t hear the rest]

PS: I can respond to that. I made one of the initial calls, especially when there was a physical altercation. The Sheriff’s Department would not respond. We had similar circumstances at Bundy Ranch (0:01:22.5). Where the Sheriff’s Department would not respond when the BLM were taking people to the ground. They deferred to the BLM when we made those 911 calls. A 911 call was made the other night.

Reporter: Who made that call? (0:01:38.9)

PS: People here at the compound. I was a witness to the event. The Sheriff’s Department failed and refused to respond and therefore security is a concern. (0:01:48.9)

BC: One of the things we’re gonna do is fill that void.

LF: I’m speaking for the Bundys. We’re looking for a de-escalation. I’m glad you’ve come, glad you’re here to help. But we’re looking for de-escalation. We’re grateful Brandon for you to come. We have a lot of work to do, trash to pick up, things to clean, fences to do. (0:02:26.2) We’re not here for escalation. We feel safe in the compound. That’s what we’re here to do. Thank you to them for coming. We’re here to be peaceful. That’s that.

Reporter: LaVoy, are you comfortable with them being here right now? (0:02:52.9)

LF: They’ve been talking to, I’m not sure who. These guys are good with Ammon. But my concern is that there are long guns here and that’s what always gets out on the media. Trying to look like this is violent. That sells a lot of newspapers. What I’m saying probably won’t even get out. But we want the long guns put away. We don’t want things to look threatening. We don’t want things to be threatening. This is peaceful. We’re calling for de-escalation. We can be neighborly and kind. We know what they’re capable of. I gotta get these gentlemen down, they need to talk to local ranchers that have come. Ranchers and locals are priority, so I gotta pull them away (0:03:44.2).

## Video moves around. Someone is talking, can’t hear or see them. JVT might be behind the camera

JVT: I’m with OK.

LF: Oh Jason, I remember. I run the media center down there. You need me, look up for me there.

JVT: I wanna talk with you, do some interviewing. Tell me how I can.

LF: I have a place for it all (0:04:24.0).

## Camera goes back to the press conference area.

JR: …these people in the Refuge are making a statement. As we speak to the community, they are fearful of federal overreach. If you media are out there interviewing everybody, you’ll find many ranchers feel they want more say.

## Camera keeps going all over the place

JR: We’re looking to moderate a peaceful resolution to stand down this operation (0:05:06.8). We’ve noticed both sides, from the Refuge and the local county Harney County government, they’re not talking to each other. We have to get some articles of resolution. We have to promote a discussion to de-escalate this peacefully. We’ve got to start. We’re going to make a proposal to Ammon Bundy.

## A man with a long rifle at the ready is in the background

JR: We feel our event was hijacked with support from the Hammonds, taking attention away from the Hammonds. (0:05:40.0) Good things have come out of this. We need to get the two sides talking. We need to have the county government here and Ammon Bundy here. As we’ve seen with situations in the past with the federal government, we don’t want to see a Waco situation. We’ve had community concerns voiced. We want to maintain a neutral buffer between the folks on the Refuge and the federal authority outside. (0:06:18.0) That way we can promote discussion, keep it neutral, and encourage it. We want to make sure the community doesn’t feel any more impact than they’ve endured. We want them to be safe in their homes and schools. We’ve gotta get a dialogue started, that’s our main purpose. We will be speaking with federal authorities and county authorities later today. Trying to get all these parties together. So far, there’s been rhetoric but nothing put on the table to drive this to resolution. We’ve gotta get that going.

## Press asks a question that can’t be heard.

JR: For security concern, we’re not discussing numbers.

VU: What’s your title?

JR: I’m a founder of PPN. 

Reporter: Neutral buffer, so it sounds like you guys aren’t staying in there.

JR: No. I want to be perfectly clear, our people are on the outside. The only thing is leadership is going to go in and speak with Ammon Bundy, and that’s the 4 founders. With that, we are not coming onto the Refuge with our people at all. They will be in town, other places, to maintain neutrality. (0:07:44.4) That’s not why we’re here. We want the two sides to talk. We sponsored the support rally for the Hammonds. We have responsibility to try to get this de-escalated. They went off the reservation. The important part is they have started an important dialogue. We saw the frustration with Greg Walden [unsure of name spelling]. That was supposed to be a 5 minute speech, he went for almost 25 minutes. It’s amazing to me that a U.S. Congressman that put together federal legislation was told by the BLM that he wasn’t interpreting law correctly, and he was the one who drafted it. (0:08:33.5) You have U.S. Congressman having the same issues. Imagine the frustration within this community of ranchers. There’s validity in getting the dialogue and discussion going. (0:08:45.4)

## A PPN guy in the back has an AZ patch.

JR: The BLM through their policy is mandated to coordinate with local community to consensus, and they choose not to do it. These land use issues in Nevada, with Sugar Pine Mine in Josephine County, here we are in Harney County. The common denominator is BLM. 

## Someone whispers near the camera, making it hard to hear JR

JVT: (whispering) I’ve been to every other operation, just at different times, so it’s nice to meet you.

JR: Everybody here likes to take pictures of what we are. But when is the media going to start investigating the BLM, when are you going to start asking hard questions. Why are these people so frustrated? Why are they standing up in the manner they are? When are you going to start investigating those land abuses (0:09:28.0)? When are going to turn the cameras on them? A culture in the BLM is creating hostility among American citizens. This beautiful landscape, it’s hard work ranching and running cattle. These people work hard, it’s not very profitable. There has to be some agreement. There are multiple uses of land, ranchers, recreation, hunting, environmental concerns. We can work together to find a middle ground that everybody’s happy with. But you can’t have this oppressive. We’ve had ranchers say they won’t speak out, they’re fearful to speak out because they’re afraid that they’ll be refused when they go to renew grazing allotments. Why aren’t you reporting that? (0:10:24.4) Find those members of the community. They’re probably fearful to speak to you.

Reporter: Brandon can you step up for a second? You heard LF ask you to put your long guns away, de-escalate the situation. Are you going to honor that?

BC: We will talk to them (0:10:46.3) about why that security staff is here for us. Ammon Bundy is fully aware of that, and maybe he wasn’t brought up to speed.

Reporter: Harney County Committee of Safety has the ability to [garbled] militia if that’s called for. Is that what this is, is this the militia?

BC: We are not the militia. We are not a militia. We are not potentially a militia. (0:11:11.3)

Reporter: Are you staying here? What’s the goal here? Do you understand why some people might be alarmed at the sight of these guys with hands on trigger guards?

BC: I understand the concern, but they’re here for everyone’s safety. They are not here to escalate. They’re here for our security. We are playing a significant role in trying to de-escalate the situation and open up communication. 

## Camera goes crazy again

Reporter: How long are they here for?

BC: They’ll be here as long as our guys…

## JVT points camera away

JVT: (whispers) I appreciate having you guys here.

Reporter: Brandon, will you be liaising with the Sheriff’s Department? (0:12:05.1)

BC: I’ve attempted to do that numerous times. He has not returned my emails or phone calls. I’ve spoken to other county officials including the judge. They’ve turned the dialogue over to the FBI. We’ve also reached out to the FBI, they haven’t returned my phone calls either. (0:12:21.2)

Reporter: Will you be here as long as it takes, if the Sheriff’s Department continues to not respond to security issues out here?

BC: We’ll be here as long as it takes. Understand our goal is to come to a resolution to this situation, with the elected officials in town. Then we can all go home.

Reporter: Brandon, I’m unsure who asked you guys to come here, or did you come here on your own?

BC: For security reasons, we’re not going to discuss that.

Reporter: I recognize you from that meeting last night. [Can’t hear the question]

BC: That was not me who gave that quote. (0:13:00.4)

Reporter: You don’t want to talk about how many people you have broadly, but can you tell us how many people you have here in public right now?

BC: We are not going to discuss numbers for security reasons. (0:13:07.9)

Reporter: You say you’re here to protect the community. Why did the community ask you to leave?

BC: The community has not asked us to leave. 

Reporter: They’ve asked for [garbled]

## Someone else respond. Can’t hear them.

BC: They have not asked us to leave. We had a huge outcry of support at the town meeting last night. You guys have a responsibility to report accurately, covering the ranchers coming up here bringing supplies. Don’t spin it. We have not been asked to leave.

Reporter: On the road here, the public road?

JR: No

BC: That’s not something we’re going to discuss. Can we move on from the security detail please. 

Reporter: Specifically what group outside of the Idaho III% are here?

BC: Understand the PPN, there’s 5 founders, 4 are here. We all represent different organizations. They can discuss that if they want to. I’m the pres of III% of Idaho. That’s my role. If they wish to discuss that, they can. 

Reporter: Where are you from?

BC: We’re from Oregon, Idaho, and Washington.

Reporter: Explain the Patriot Network then, is that an affiliation of groups?

BC: PPN was founded last year with 5 orgs to make a bigger umbrella org.

Reporter: Idaho III%, that’s spelled like on your shirt?

BC: Yes. (0:14:41.2)

Reporter: What are the 5 organizations.

BC: If they want to discuss that [points behind him] they can do that.

Reporter: People have referred to this

## Camera goes crazy, can’t hear the question

Reporter: Are we suffering from a constitutional crisis right now?

BC: The whole country is suffering from a constitutional crisis. We need to understand that our rights from the Constitution, the Constitution guarantees our God-given rights, that’s being eroded daily. I keep hearing about Idaho. This affects all of us. This isn’t an Idaho issue or an Oregon issue or a Montana issue or California issue. Oregon is our neighbor, we’re going to help them just as they would help us.

Reporter: Will you liaise with the FBI as well? Let them know this is not an escalation (0:15:37.4)?

BC: That’s our next agenda item.

Reporter: How do we follow up with you?

BC: I’ll give you my card.

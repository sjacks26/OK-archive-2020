<content:encoded>I am not disagreeing with anything in the fine article above. I am offering a very broad generality regarding self-defense. Remember, there are always exceptions depending upon the particular situation. 
<p>What I offer is; the sneaky survive.</p>
<p>Please consider that declaration. In a survival situation, especially in the case of societal collapse, there will always be bigger, stronger, better armed and groups of thugs posing extreme danger to you and your who will be able to best your strengths.</p>
<p>But, to harm or kill you they have to find you. Perhaps seeking knowledge from an “escape and evasion” manual would assist in learning the “tricks of the trade” regarding being invisible to threats. It is a complicated topic. The smell of smoke can reveal your “hidey-hole.” Hunting small game for food with a regular firearm reveals your position… use a quality quiet air rifle for that. </p>
<p>An adage tells us that the battle best won is the battle never fought. Yes, be ready for self-defense but avoiding threats is the best strategy in my opinion. If evil must be fought muster alongside like-minded civil folks who want a decent society for good folks to peacefully live within and THEN prepare to battle the evil among you and have the superior force with the “might of right” bolstering your commitment to eliminating the evil contaminating your area.</p>
<p>Good luck. Let us hope the USA never suffers extreme societal breakdown but their are no guarantees in life and I have concerns about America’s future for reasons I cover elsewhere (my blogs).</p>
<p>Health and happiness to all of you!!!</p>

<p>The ideal vision of retirement is one of constant   leisure supported by a sizable nest egg. Building a nest egg takes   decades of discipline and careful planning. Unfortunately, many   Americans did not adequately prepare and combined with the casino like   financial system, many have been washed out of the system. Many retiring   baby boomers are going to use <a href="http://www.mybudget360.com/social-security-demographic-time-bomb-retirement-older-americans-numbers/" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.mybudget360.com/social-security-demographic-time-bomb-retirement-older-americans-numbers/', 'Social Security as their primary crutch for retirement income');">Social Security as their primary crutch for retirement income</a>.   The Social Security system was never designed to be the primary target   for retirement income yet this is what we are facing. The problem of   course is that Americans simply do not have much sizable wealth in   stocks and bonds. While the majority of Americans own houses, most own   very little to no stocks. This is why the current record in the stock   market means little in the face of an imminent retirement. Also, the one   vehicle to build net worth in housing is largely locking out young   future buyers thanks to massive buying from Wall Street and big   investors nearly guaranteeing another retirement disaster after this   one. One crisis at a time. So why will so many Americans be in dire   financial situations as they enter their golden years?</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Very little saved = more work</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Americans are doing a poor job at saving money  for  any purpose including retirement. A recent survey found that over  one  third of Americans have no savings to their name:</p>
<blockquote><p>“(<a href="http://www.ny1.com/content/lifestyles/money_matters/214223/new-survey-shows-over-one-third-of-americans-without-retirement-savings/" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.ny1.com/content/lifestyles/money_matters/214223/new-survey-shows-over-one-third-of-americans-without-retirement-savings/', 'NY1');">NY1</a>)   For the first time, Bankrate decided to ask Americans how much they’ve   saved for retirement. The answer is alarming. Over a third of those   polled—36 percent—said they haven’t saved a dime.</p>
<p>“They have nothing. Maybe there’s some money  under a  mattress somewhere, but as far as into an actual account  somewhere  that’s accruing interest, there is no savings for these  folks,” says  Bankrate.com Research and Statistics Analyst Chris Kahn.</p>
<p>That’s especially true for younger workers,  which  isn’t really surprising. The older they get, the more likely it is  that  they’ve started to squirrel something away, but not everyone. A  full  quarter of respondents between the ages of 50 and 64 have yet to  start  saving.”</p></blockquote>
<p>This is not good. In fact, many younger  Americans  with large amounts of student debt are actually starting off  in a  position of a negative net worth. Other data has found that  Americans  with student debt are likely to trail their counterparts with  no debt:</p>
<p><strong><img alt="young and in debt" border="0" height="477" src="https://www.silverbearcafe.com/private/08.14/images/young-and-in-debt.jpg" width="321"/></strong></p>
<p>Since college with no debt is largely a  pipedream  for most, many Americans entering college today will need to  take on  some sort of debt. The young will have a tougher go at  retirement  compared to the present case of baby boomers. What is  troubling about  the case of baby boomers is that they had a massive  bullish stock  market yet somehow, most are poorly <a href="http://www.mybudget360.com/social-security-demographic-time-bomb-retirement-older-americans-numbers/" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.mybudget360.com/social-security-demographic-time-bomb-retirement-older-americans-numbers/', 'positioned for retirement');">positioned for retirement</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="http://www.thinkadvisor.com/2014/03/31/are-boomers-headed-for-retirement-disaster" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.thinkadvisor.com/2014/03/31/are-boomers-headed-for-retirement-disaster', '“(Think Advisor');">“(Think Advisor</a>)   A DC system forces workers to choose how much to save and how to   invest. Some save more, some don’t save enough, and a lot of workers   don’t save anything. According to 2010 Fed data, about 45% of American   workers aren’t currently saving for retirement.”</p></blockquote>
<p>So nearly half of Americans have saved nothing  for  retirement. Not a good thing. The Employee Benefit Research  Institute  found that nearly half of workers had less than $10,000 saved.  This is  probably enough to live 6 months by scraping by on cheap food  and  water. Less than 10 percent of Americans now have access to a  pension:</p>
<p><strong><img alt="pensions" border="0" height="431" src="https://www.silverbearcafe.com/private/08.14/images/pensions.jpg" width="406"/></strong></p>
<p>Back in the early 1980s, this figure was above  60  percent. Rising costs and employers slashing benefits has been a big   culprit for this push. But it should be clear that 401ks and self-serve   retirement plans have done a horrible job at preparing most Americans   for retirement:</p>
<blockquote><p>“(<a href="http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2014-01-02/baby-boomers-poorer-in-old-age-than-their-parents" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2014-01-02/baby-boomers-poorer-in-old-age-than-their-parents', 'Business Week');">Business Week</a>)   No longer able to afford her four-bedroom house in West Hartford,   Conn., which she purchased for $225,000 at the height of the housing   bubble, Lee rents it out for $1,600 a month to cover her mortgage and   taxes and hopes to hold it until prices rise so she can recoup her   investment. She now lives in the basement of her friend Brita Tate’s   house in Wellfleet, Mass., paying $400 a month in rent. She found a job   managing the spa at the Crowne Pointe Historic Inn in nearby   Provincetown, where she earns $13.50 an hour working as a combination   hostess, receptionist, fixer of gym equipment, and laundress.”</p></blockquote>
<p>The above case is going to be very common. Many  baby  boomers are going to realize that the notion of retirement is  going to  include work, even if it is part-time in nature. Thankfully, we  are  doing a fabulous job of creating <a href="http://www.mybudget360.com/part-time-work-us-canada-japan-part-time-employment/" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.mybudget360.com/part-time-work-us-canada-japan-part-time-employment/', 'low wage work');">low wage work</a> with little benefits to fill this gap. The thought that financial   worries would be far in the rearview mirror for most baby boomers is   unlikely to be true. Many will be struggling but in light of the battle   their offspring is facing, their fight might seem more manageable   although time is not on their side. Social Security will be the main   source of income for millions of <a href="http://www.mybudget360.com/social-security-demographic-time-bomb-retirement-older-americans-numbers/" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.mybudget360.com/social-security-demographic-time-bomb-retirement-older-americans-numbers/', 'retiring baby boomers');">retiring baby boomers</a>. I think many Americans are going to get a rude awakening as to what it means to be retired.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">I find this article to be one of the better ones pointing out the complicity of both political parties, and their Presidents, in the destruction of America by end runs around the Constitution. BOTH political parties are guilty. They have BOTH ignored their oaths, ignored the Constitution, and ignored the Natural Rights of the American people. It is not a question of Republican versus Democrat, of Right versus Left, it is BOTH sides. The sooner the American people accept that we have been, and continue to be, duped, the sooner we can get our Country back; our Constitution back. – Shorty Dawkins, Associate Editor</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">It’s that time of year again! President’s Day, a time to honor America’s two greatest presidents in history (at least from history book consensus) – George Washington our first and Abraham Lincoln our sixteenth president. By conveniently combining the nearest weekend midpoint between their birthdays (22nd and 12th respectively) and lopping in Valentine’s Day and the NBA All Star Weekend to make it a post-Super Bowl Bonanza for everyone, kind of like what the three-day MLK weekend is to the yearend holiday extravaganza. But between our Presidents’ Day sales, popcorn and beer, this President’s Day 2015 might also be an opportune time to pause and reflect on our presidents over this last century. President’s Day then becomes a sober reckoning of how the fate of our cherished democratic republic was lost and stolen by today’s totalitarian oligarchy. A chronicle of this last century’s presidents offers us Americans a greater understanding of the diminished role our figurehead presidents have played as a mere public face to the shrouded power elite puppet masters pulling their strings. What follows is a presentational overview providing a step-by-step thread of continuity that has led us to the New World Order burgeoning today.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">1913 was a pivotal year that brought to fruition the meticulously laid out agenda conspired in total <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2012-02-15/the-secret-meeting-that-launched-the-federal-reserve-echoes" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2012-02-15/the-secret-meeting-that-launched-the-federal-reserve-echoes', 'secrecy of the Jekyll Island Coup d’Etat');" target="_blank" title="Bloomberg article">secrecy of the Jekyll Island Coup d’Etat</a> that culminated with the Federal Reserve Act signed by President Woodrow Wilson establishing the deceptively covert, privatized central banking cabal of the Federal Reserve Board. The other illegal 1913 coup that was part of the low-blow, one-two near knockout punch against the American people was the birth of the federal income tax. Thus the foundation of today’s globalist Ponzi scheme on the verge right now of implosion gained its lethal foothold into our lives just one year before “the war to end all wars.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A handful of extremely powerful men including prominent New York Senator Nelson Aldrich, Paul Warburg (representing the Rothschilds of Europe), Jacob Schiff  (with also longtime Rothschild ties) of Kuhn, Loeb &amp; Company and a few others like Benjamin Strong representing the financial interests of America’s most elite money barons and industrialists like John D. Rockefeller met at J.P. Morgan’s hunting club on a Georgia Island in 1910 to iron out the strategy to take over America’s government by usurping the power of the US Treasury to produce currency.</p>

Rockefeller met at J.P. Morgan’s hunting club on a Georgia Island in 1910 to iron out the strategy to take over America’s government by usurping the power of the US Treasury to produce currency.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In his autobiography during the same year the Ponzi scheme was launched, then former <a href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2012/08/roosevelt-to-dissolve-the-unholy-alliance-between-corrupt-business-and-corrupt-politics-is-the-first-task-of-the-statesmanship-of-the-day.html" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2012/08/roosevelt-to-dissolve-the-unholy-alliance-between-corrupt-business-and-corrupt-politics-is-the-first-task-of-the-statesmanship-of-the-day.html', 'President Theodore Roosevelt wrote');" target="_blank">President Theodore Roosevelt wrote</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Behind the ostensible government sits enthroned an invisible government owing no allegiance and acknowledging no responsibility to the people. To destroy this invisible government, to befoul the unholy alliance between corrupt business and corrupt politics is the first task of the statesmanship of the day.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With one of the Jekyll Island participants Colonel Edward M. House acting as President elect Woodrow Wilson’s personal advisor, the robber barons had plucked the Princeton University president from relative obscurity, planted him in office as the Governor of New Jersey in 1911 and then had him elected president the following year. His predecessor President Taft who had opposed a central bank was easily replaced by the naïve and pliable Wilson. Thus when he took his oath of office in January 1913, Colonel House was the elitist insider who was able to easily manipulate Wilson to further serve the interest of the banking cabal. House’s instrumental role of influence and power over Woodrow Wilson might be analogous to what Zbigniew Brzezinski’s was to President Jimmy Carter and Henry Kissinger to President Nixon. But the former Ivy League president was an intelligent man who had written a book published the same year he became president showing he was fully aware of the shadowy bankster cabal. Based on the quote below from his <a href="http://www.crossroad.to/Quotes/globalism/cfr.htm" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.crossroad.to/Quotes/globalism/cfr.htm', '1913 The New Freedom, Wilson');" target="_blank">1913 The New Freedom, Wilson</a> knew a transformation of power was underway, making him all the more culpable when he proceeded to do everything the elite wanted and expected of him. In some ways knowing what he knew, signing the Federal Reserve Act and Federal Income Tax Act the same year his book was published made him a traitor to Americans:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Some of the biggest men in the US, in the field of commerce and manufacturing, are afraid of somebody, are afraid of something. They know that there is a power somewhere so organized, so subtle, so watchful, so interlocked, so complete, so pervasive, that they had better not speak above their breath when they speak in condemnation of it…. We have been dreading all along the time when the combined power of high finance would be greater than the power of government….</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Yeah, if you’re as weak as putty in their hands. To show just how much President Wilson was the first puppet president to be used by oligarchs, dancing gleefully to their diabolical tune, Wilson actually uttered:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Mr. House is my second personality. He is my independent self. His thoughts and mine are one. If I were in his place I would do just as he suggested… if anyone thinks he is reflecting my opinion by whatever action he takes, they are welcome to the conclusion.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With the formation of the Federal Reserve, wealth and power in the United States was instantly consolidated within a few Eastern Establishment families that would ensure their offspring were always educated at the finest Ivy League schools such as Harvard, Yale, Princeton and Columbia. Upon graduation they would enter Wall Street banking firms, global corporations and eventually infiltrate into key positions in the government. This power grab resulting in control over the <a href="http://www.globalresearch.ca/the-wall-street-ponzi-scheme-called-fractional-reserve-banking/11600" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.globalresearch.ca/the-wall-street-ponzi-scheme-called-fractional-reserve-banking/11600', 'flow of money through loans to the federal government');" target="_blank">flow of money through loans to the federal government</a>, and then collecting interest on those loans, guaranteed loan repayment by income tax collection. This new monetary system was predicated on an invisible elite taking control of the government. What a coup, not unlike what 9/11 is to totalitarianism.</p>

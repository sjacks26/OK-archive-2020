<p>by Shorty Dawkins</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">The election of 2014 is finally over. Whew! I don’t know about you, but the suspense was killing me. I spent hours wondering which of our one-party subsets would win. Would it be the Democrats who won? (Who want bigger government and more control over our lives, leading up to the Globalist One-World Utopia) Or, would it be the Republicans who won? (Who want bigger government and more control over our lives, leading up to the Globalist One-World Utopia)</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">In reality, I never once doubted who would win: The Elite. Like going into a Casino, where the odds are rigged against you, so are the elections. They pretend the elections are open, fair, and honest, but they are not. The power of the controlled media, coupled with the power of big money, prevents real, informed choices. Do you honestly think there is any substantial difference between the Republicans and Democrats? Obama has led us into the Libyan fiasco, and the Syrian fiasco. Gee, John McCain, who will head the powerful Armed Services Committee in the Senate, has been a cheerleader for those actions. McCain wants heavier involvement in Syria. (Boots on the ground?)</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Will the borders of our Nation be secured, now that the Republicans control both Houses of Congress? Think again. Or will the US follow Canada and Australia’s lead and ban flights from Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea from entering the US unless having gone through a period of suitable quarantine? Think again. Will the Federal Government suddenly respect our Rights, such as our privacy Rights, free speech Rights, Right to Bear Arms, Right to Habeus Corpus? In administrations of both Parties, our Rights have been steadily eroded. They are, to put it bluntly, bought and paid for. Both Parties are controlled by the Elite. True, an occasional eccentric believer in the Constitution, and the limited government it specifies, will emerge, but, like Ron Paul, they will be marginalized by the controlled press.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><strong>The Better of Two Evils</strong></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><span style="font-weight: normal">There are many people, (voters), who feel they have no option but to vote for the better candidate of the two major Parties. This is the “Better of Two Evils” meme, which is a tool the Elite use to control elections. The thinking is, that at least the worst of the two candidates is beaten. Better this man/woman than that man/woman. Some folks just can’t get it through their heads that they are still voting for evil. Rather than vote their conscience, they throw away their vote by voting for the lesser of two evils, when they honestly believe they are making their vote count by doing so. This is the fallacy too many have failed to recognize. Why, I ask, would I vote for someone, (anyone), who wants to deprive me of my Rights? Why would I vote for someone who has shown their disdain for our Constitution? Without the Constitution to guide and serve us, we are at the mercy of the mob. </span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><strong>An Informed Citizenry</strong></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><span style="font-weight: normal">For a Republic to survive, there must be an informed Citizenry. They must be informed about many things. First, they must be informed about, and understand, our Constitution, which created our Republic. Second, they must be knowledgeable about the candidates they must decide to vote for, or not vote for. If a candidate has a public record, what have they voted for, or against? It is not the words of candidates alone that must be weighed, but their actions, also. Third, they must be aware of current and past events. </span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><span style="font-weight: normal">Unfortunately, the people are too concerned with trivial matters, such as their favorite sports team, Dancing with The Stars, or what movie star just got married or divorced. I give you as evidence, the following video:</span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><strong><span style="font-weight: normal">Politically-Challenged: Texas Tech Edition</span></strong></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><span style="font-weight: normal">And here is a George Carlin video worth watching. (For those who don’t know George Carlin, please be advised he uses vulgar speech) :</span></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">
</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0in">
</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0in">
</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><span style="font-weight: normal">Do I think the election results matter? No. The path dictated by the Elite is being followed, as planned. When enough people wake up to the Truth, perhaps things can change. Until then, we can only Reach, Teach and Inspire, and prepare for what lies ahead.</span></p>

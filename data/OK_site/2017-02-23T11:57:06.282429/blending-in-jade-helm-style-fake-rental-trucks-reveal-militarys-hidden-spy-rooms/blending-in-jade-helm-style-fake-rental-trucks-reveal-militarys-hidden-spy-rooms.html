<p>Jade Helm’s tagline is “mastering the human domain”.</p>
<p>We have been told that, in part, this has to do with special operations outfits from the Navy, Army, Air Force and Marines using covert warfare techniques to infiltrate average American neighborhoods (as mock “hostile environments”) and walk “undetected amongst civilian populations” without being noticed by the rest of us. Oh, <a href="http://www.chron.com/news/article/Covert-warfare-comming-to-Texas-6157685.php#photo-7713764" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.chron.com/news/article/Covert-warfare-comming-to-Texas-6157685.php#photo-7713764', 'and it’s for');" target="_blank">and it’s for</a> “refining the skills needed against an ever changing <em>foreign</em> threat” (emphasis added on the word ‘foreign’) according to Army Special Operation Command spokesman Mark Lastoria.</p>
<p>Well, here’s one way they reportedly have done that.</p>
<p>Mike Lamb, a staff writer for Barstow, California’s Desert Dispatch <a href="http://www.desertdispatch.com/article/20150811/NEWS/150819988" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.desertdispatch.com/article/20150811/NEWS/150819988', 'was invited to a small press meeting');" target="_blank">was invited to a small press meeting</a> prior to a joint forcible entry operation training exercise at Fort Irwin National Training Center called Operation Dragon Spear last month. Military vehicles and gear were put on display and the reporters were allowed to take pictures and ask questions.</p>
<p><em>“What I’m about to share with you is not top secret. But there were U.S. Army special operations soldiers lurking around Barstow, driving down our streets and we didn’t even know it,”</em> he wrote.</p>
<p>Part of the military’s stealth technology involved a Ryder truck and a hay truck:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Parked outside were a Ryder rental truck full of furniture and a hay truck. As I stood there staring at them, the same public affairs officials pointed to <strong>the dryer inside the Ryder truck, its door wide open. I walked closer and looked inside the dryer. He pointed his lighted phone at the opening, revealing a large room.</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>The same for the hay truck. A small doorway led to large room inside.</strong></em></p></blockquote>
<p>Just think about that for a second. A Ryder moving truck and a hay truck driving around your town with hidden surveillance and command rooms inside of them filled with special operations officers, just driving casually up and down American streets doing… well, whatever they want to, undetected.</p>
<p><em>“When you think of the militarily using stealth, a hay truck is not what comes to mind. But according to the Green Beret who stood by the trucks, it was ‘mission accomplished’,” </em>Lamb reported.</p>
<p>“Mission accomplished” because they “infiltrated” Barstow and conducted surveillance on American streets in these fake trucks, and reportedly, nobody suspected a thing. In the lead up to Jade Helm, residents in areas where the drills would be running across the Southwest were told to report suspicious activity in order to test the military’s effectiveness.</p>
<p>No one must’ve reported the Ryder moving truck or the hay trucks driving up and down the street…</p>
<p>“It was very successful,” one of the Green Berets at the demonstration told Lamb. “We did everything we wanted to do.”</p>
<p>And what exactly was it that they wanted to do?</p>
<p>But of course this is all about the <em>foreign</em> threat, as evidenced by all the Ryder moving trucks driving around the Middle East, right?</p>
<p>Is that it? Or are we witnessing further training and acclimation of an occupying force in our own country?</p>

## Alex Jones; Stewart Rhodes

AJ: SR, he started OK in the last year or so, and it’s really exploded in size. We’ll give you the website and some of the testimonials before we go. The government is clearly out of line. It’s violating the Bill of Rights and Constitution, it’s run by foreign offshore banks, they’ve stolen almost 24 trillion dollars in the last 10 months. Obama has proven he’s a liar on every front. Then magically they put out DHS reports saying that all these evil American gun owners are about to attack the president. Right on cue, the SPLC comes out with a report demonizing all these good people, mixing us in with clearly bad folks. Now ABC news is doing it, and I saw this before OKC, before the feds stage terror attacks so that they can be the victims and clamp down on freedom, they do this. This is the preparatory phase. SR, do you smell a false flag in the wind?

SR: I think we’re headed towards the territory where they could use a pretext such as the flu to, it appears that what they’re doing is setting up the infrastructure, the planning, and the rhetoric so that all you have to do is flip the switch when the flu pops up, and the next thing you know they’ve imposed martial law. I want to go back to what we were talking about a minute ago. You’re right about, the first line should be that the states should have to give permission. Then you look at Article 1 Section 8, it also says that Congress has the power to call forth the militia to execute the laws of the union, suppress insurrection, and repel invasion. It’s not just a good idea for the states to be in charge. The founders had the answer to the question of who shall guard the guardians was that we ourselves, the people would be the guardians in the state militias.

AJ: (0:02:01.0) Then your legislature that you’ve elected is in charge, so when you see troops coming down the street, they are from your town, your city, you know their daddy and momma, you might even be their granddaddy, and the legislature commanding them, the governor commanding them, you voted for them. That is the people ruling.

SR: And you can only have outside militia from somewhere else if that legislature in your state or your governor invite them in. Okay. And nothing there is contemplating the standing army doing anything inside the US. It’s supposed to be the militia. [garbled]

AJ: The standing army defends the nation’s borders and has a navy to defend, but it doesn’t have any action inside. Have you seen the editorial cartoon of the US, it says homeland security with all the cannons pointing inside the country?

SR: Yeah. That’s what’s happening. Everything Bush created is now being turned inward. All that infrastructure. We are so far from the original intention of the Founders. Forget about the Posse Comitatus act, that’s only a statute. Look at the design of the Constitution itself. We’re wildly beyond what they intended. They wanted the militia of the states to be the internal security force. That’d be us. How are we going to terrorize ourselves? You can’t. That was their insight.

AJ: (0:03:21.2) Now SR, Obama and his controllers in their slick lies, they demonize the constitutional militia but then they want a federal or Stalinistic or Mao-like federal gestapo. They want a clone, but an evil doppelganger. They want a twisted militia that’s federal, and they go that’s in the Constitution. They try to have it both ways. They demonize a real militia, but they have their counterfeit federal militia. Can you explain to people from the Constitution the difference?

SR: Sure. As it says in 2A, a well-regulated militia is necessary to the security of a free state. The militias are from the states not from the national government. That’s not a militia. When the national government hires someone to do anything, they are now part of a national government, not part of the state structure. It’s entirely opposite, like you said, it’s like the evil twin of a militia. It’s more like the Brownshirts or the Gestapo or the Stasi. [garbled]

AJ: Exactly, the answer to the Stasi or the Brownshirts, and I hope the SPLC gets this quote. We are the opposite of the Brownshirts or the Mao Brigades, the youth brigades. This is the real people’s army, not their wicked counterfeit. Go ahead.

SR: That’s right. They’re trying to create a new version. They’re adopting the old forms, this is what happens. They’ll adopt the old forms and twist them into something. This is done throughout history. Every oppressive regime takes the law and turns it into a weapon. They’ll adopt the forms and bastardize them. Orwell warned us of this stuff many years ago. It shouldn’t be a surprise. But we have to be on guard, and the first line is your state sovereignty. You have to have. In fact, this is what needs to happen. State legislators need to convene special sessions to discuss and come to conclusions and pass resolutions about the claimed authority of NORTHCOM and DHS and FEMA to come into their state during a pandemic. That’s what’s happening.

AJ: We have to go to break. When we come back, let’s get into that and 1A. Yes, we now have the Governor’s Association sending a letter to the Pentagon and the White House saying you’re going to put troops on the streets? And the Army’s answer is yeah. It was 20k last year, now it’s 400k. Will it be a million next year?

AJ: (0:05:58.5) The globalists have a couple of things going for them. They’ve got the central government, they have the unlimited power of the central banks to issue fiat made-up currency. And their plan is so diabolical, so wicked, so corrupt, it’s wilder than a James Bond evil villain plot. The movie Moonraker about a plan to set up a world government and kill everybody, they got the plots for that from real government documents like ecoscience. Flemming, who worked for MI6 that wrote the books, admitted that. He did write Moonraker under another name, I forget the name it wasn’t exactly Moonraker. The point is that they’ve got that going for them, but once people find out this is really true. When I get on air and go here’s the Army purchase orders for FEMA camps. Here’s the Army hiring people for domestic internment and resettlement programs. Here’s the actual code on it. When I show you mainstream news articles, this is out of the Hill, big major newspaper in DC. And it says Governors opposes DoD emergency powers. They sent a letter, the heads of the Governors Association, saying what is this, you can’t federalize the states and put troops on the streets. They were responding to what has now come out in the news, these reports out of the AP and the Progressive, governors oppose DoD and emergency powers. That other headline I was mentioning earlier, the Pentagon wants authority to post almost 400k military personnel in US. I have article here where they’re training to take over the cities, admitting they’re going to do it. I had that in my stack. National Guard takes over school in swine flu vaccine riot drill. I can go back a few years and pull up stuff like the Pensacola News Journal, where the Marines unannounced took over the middle school, point guns at the kids’ heads, the kids think it’s real. Then the Marines say the President wants you to know what martial law is like, that was in the newspaper. Folks, this is a real program going on.

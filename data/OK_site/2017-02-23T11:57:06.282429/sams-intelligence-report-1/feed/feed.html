<content:encoded>I think we need to harden the cooling systems of our 200 nuclear reactors from both emp and cyber attacks. If we have multiple failures of these cooling systems, all our preparedness could be for naught. 
<p>I recommend reading Joel Ho’s thoughts on emp (google search him).</p>
<p>I think we need to look at things with a thicker skin perspective. The Moslem and Media terroristas are having entirely too much fun manipulating our over-blown fears. It is this exaggerated over-reaction that is a threat to our national security. As Pogo said, “We have met the enemy and the enemy is us.” The internet and instant, real-time communications isn’t helping.</p>
<p>I believe it helps to keep in the fore-front of our minds that our population is over 320 million people and has a normal average mortality of over 4 million a year and that we have the safest schools in the world shuttling 50 million kids to and from school each day watched over by police, paramedics, firefighters, teachers and parents, even while considering tragedies.</p>
<p>As it is, the tragedy of 911 turned out not to be a threat to national security but our over-reaction of going to war in the Middle East I think is.</p>

<content:encoded>Who will run for Sheriff in Harney County?
<p>Dave Ward (appointed) and Alan Johnson (reserve) are on the ballot. They will be more of the same.</p>
<p>If a third person runs, there will be a primary in May and the top two will run off in November.</p>
<p>Deadline is approaching.</p>
<p>This is a golden opportunity to elect a good sheriff. Is Oathkeepers more than just talk?</p>
<p>Also deadline for Republican and Democratic precinct committeeperson filing is same day. Change the corrupt parties in Oregon from within.</p>
<p>Call me.</p>

(I instigated the Republican Party 4th Congressional District “Standing for Your Rights” Convention in Roseburg in May 2015 in support of the Galice miners and property rights.)</p>

<content:encoded>I will be heading to Ashland soon to establish my White Tiger Farm there.  I’m a Vietnam vet, served in the Navy, and later in the Army, both with honorable service.  I strongly urge all vets, as well as active duty personnel, to visit this site to refresh your memory on Constitutional law, and what has been done to our country, and is still being done.  Disabled vet, and constitutional attorney, Kris Anne Hall, tells it like it is, loud and clear.  <a href="http://krisannehall.com" rel="nofollow">http://krisannehall.com</a> she spells out what we need to do to take back our country from the traitors in DC.

<content:encoded>There are more people who would support an Oath Keepers chapter in Klamath Falls, Oregon, but only with competent, good leadership.

## Stewart Rhodes; DK

SR: I’m on the line with John Oetken, our Southern California director, and also Dimitri Karras. He’s the CEO of Ares Armor in Southern California that was recently raided by the ATF. Let our guys know what happened.

DK: They came in about a week ago, made a bunch of threats saying that if we didn’t turn over a list of customers and a specific product that had a questionable status, that they were going to execute a search warrant against all of our buildings and take everything, all of our computers, information, pretty much just make life very difficult. We went to the court and ask for relief from the court, for the court to determine whether the part in question is a firearm. This is an agency that has in the past declared shoestrings to be firearms. I’m not making that up. The ATF has written a determination letter in the past declaring a 14 inch shoestring to be a firearm. So they make these threats towards us, we got our temporary restraining order granted based on the merits of what was going on. On Friday, they got the judge to clarify that the restraining order did not prohibit lawful criminal proceedings. They instantly raided us the next day and made good on their threats towards me. So basically I got out of line and had to be smacked back in line.

SR: (0:01:36.5) What’s interesting is about that is you went to the court system for relief. I was actually surprised when I saw that the judge granted the temporary restraining order. But like you said, he modified his order to declare that it doesn’t affect criminal investigations. Then he further prohibited you from divesting yourself of any of your records or inventory, so it actually made it worse for you. You couldn’t even do anything with your inventory, right?

DK: It was just the inventory in question. It’s funny that order was in there. I can only imagine that it was argued that I would be selling them under the table or that they would disappear, which is very funny from an organization that’s responsible for transporting weapons to the drug cartels. If you watch any recent news, they can’t keep track of their own weapons. To be honest, anybody is probably a more responsible party to be holding on to material other than the ATF. With that side, while the temporary restraining order was still in effect, and actually it’s still in effect right now, it’s just clarified.

SR: It’s just gutless you mean.

DK: Yeah. I had a meeting with 2 ATF agents. I showed them exactly where all that product was housed, in a separate room in 1 of our facilities. That room, we had changed the locks out, there were only 2 keys in existence, I placed a camera pointing towards that door so anybody who went near that room was watched. I was making 100% sure that they felt secure that there was no way we were doing anything under the table or shady. We wanted this handled in the courts. We didn’t want it to come to this nonsense as it is right now. But apparently, they took the advice of Leroy Jenkins and just jumped right on in there. I also offered to hand the keys to that room to the 2 ATF agents that were there for safe keeping, so they would be 100% sure that we were not divesting any of this product. I also offered them access to our security system so they could watch the door to the room, to make sure. If in fact they were saying otherwise, it’s an absolute joke.

SR: (0:03:46.5) They still raided you. Just so folks know what we’re talking about, you sell, among other things, 80% lowers. 80% lower is an AR-15 lower that is manufactured up to 80% of the finished product. Under the ATF’s prior directions and letters, it’s not a firearm because it has crucial fitting and manufacturing processes left to be done. Among which are what?

DK: The ATF has said in the past is the stuff that needs to be undone, that the customer would have to do themselves, is the trigger control pocket, the safety selector hole, hammer pin, trigger pin, and trigger through-hole. All these operations are left undone on the product in question. With that said, the ATF issued a determination that is based on information that is non-factual about the manufacturing process that is used to make this specific product. They were informed of their mistake before any of this happened. They know that the information they’re using is incorrect. They know these things should not be considered firearms. I guarantee because we are fighting with the ATF and they get to, apparently we have an organization in our country that not only gets to interpret law but to execute that law as well, which is a huge and gross overstepping of constitutional [garbled]

SR: They get to write their own law. The determination letter, they’ve determined in the past that a shoestring is a firearm. They’ve also determined that a malfunctioning firearms is a full auto. That’s why they have, David Olofson is still in prison for example. [garbled] run amok.

DK: (0:05:25.4) It’s ludicrous, the power these people have. I used this example in one of the other interviews. Imagine that you are a pen manufacturer, you made the latest and greatest pen on the planet. Your pen writes in outer space and under water. You’re innovative, you’re an entrepreneur, you’re making things happen. Low and behold, the ATF decides your pen is a firearm. To say that’s ridiculous that they would do that, it’s ridiculous to think that they wouldn’t, considering that they decided a shoestring is a firearm in the past. Say they decide your pen is a firearm. Then they come and say I want the customer records of every person you’ve sold your pen to, and I want all of your pens. What are you going to do that in that position? I can tell you there’s nothing you can do, and if you tell them no, you’re going to get raided a couple days later. It’s ludicrous that there’s an organization that has that much power in this country.

SR: (0:06:23.4) The background for this is that, back in 2012 as you said in your statement, they came to you back then trying to get your customer list, trying to pressure you into giving up your customer list. Back then, did you sell the polymer versions of 80% lowers?

DK: No we did not.

SR: So this is important for guys to understand. They were trying to get your customer list when it was 80% lowers made out of aluminum. You wouldn’t turn it over. So they waited for an excuse, a rationale, that these polymer versions, which are really the same thing, are somehow firearms because the manufacturing process is a little bit different. They seized on that as their excuse to get an invalid and unjust search warrant to come in and get what they’ve always wanted, which is your customer list. That’s pretty much it, right?

DK: Yeah. And I can’t make the statement that their search warrant is invalid. We haven’t seen the affidavit, it’s currently sealed.

SR: If it’s based upon erroneous information about the status of the item, that it’s not really a firearm and they know it, then.

DK: Yeah I can tell you that the only determination letter I’ve seen from the ATF about this product is based on erroneous information. I can tell you that with 100% certainty.

SR: (0:07:39.4) When we talk about customer lists, we’re really talking about any record, if some guy used a credit card to buy it or if he bought it online, anything like that. You don’t keep full records, cause they’re not firearms, right?

DK: No, we don’t keep full records like an FFL dealership. We keep records in the course of regular business, like any corporation would. Contact things, sales receipts, sales orders, purchase orders. That’s what they took from us.

SR: But a guy could walk into your store with cash in hand and buy 80% lower, just like he’s buying a flashlight accessory or anything else for his AR.

DK: Absolutely. It’s funny, I’ve become friends with this person who’s in the FBI. He’s been a customer of ours for a long time. I’m not going to say what his name is, but he uses a pseudonym. Let’s say he’s John Wayne, that’s not his actual pseudonym in our system. Every time he comes in, I first asked him why he wants to use a pseudonym. He said I don’t trust the government. I sat there and laughed and said you work in the FBI man, he said yep, that’s why I’m using a pseudonym.

SR: Who knows better than he!

DK: Exactly.

SR: (0:08:57.2) This is, just so our guys know. You’re a Marine veteran, correct?

DK: Yes sir.

SR: All the guys involved in your company are also Marine veterans. This is a veteran-owned company being harassed by the ATF in their ridiculous war against American gun owners. I want to encourage all OK to support these guys. How can they support you? Is there a legal defense fund they can donate to?

DK: We’re getting that set up with a non-profit. The best thing we can use for support right now is we’re trying to reach out to members of Congress, somebody who can do something or bring attention to the issue that’s going on. The media attention is also vastly important, it makes it to where they can’t do any of these underhanded, shady little deals like they were trying to do originally with us. It offers us a little bit of protection as far as, as long as the story keeps getting out. Plus it’s important that people know that this sort of thing is going on behind closed doors. The only reason that people know about this is because we said no. How many people do you think different agencies approach, businesses or not, they just hand over the customer information? They just roll over? The only reason anybody knows this is happening is because we stood up, we said no, we spoke out about it.

SR: That’s a good point. They threaten you with prosecution, with criminal proceedings. They said if you let us have what we want, turn over your polymer lowers and your records, we won’t pursue criminal charges against you and we won’t raid you. That’s coercion.

DK: (0:10:42.2) Absolutely that’s coercion. It’s ludicrous. Here’s the other thing: if we were this criminal organization they’re making us out to be, why would they approach us and make some sort of offer like that? Does that make any sense to a logical human being, that a government law enforcement agency that’s quote-unquote under investigation and be like hey guys we know you’re doing nothing wrong, we know you’re a legitimate business, just you hand over your customer records, we’ll sweep it under the rug, everything’s fine, don’t worry about it, nobody will know you turned over the customer records to us, it’s okay. Why would they do that if we really are this criminal organization? Riddle me that one.

SR: (0:11:24.7) They don’t do that with the cartel, in fact it’s the opposite. They make sure the cartel gets their guns.

DK: Absolutely. As a matter of fact, well I can’t say that statement directly, but it would not surprise me if all of those 80% receivers were milled into firearms production style and shipped down to Mexico. These are the same people that brought you wonderful American events such as Waco and Ruby Ridge, and maybe they get their friends over with the FBI’s Hostage Roasting Team involved in it as well next time.

SR: Hopefully not. Like you said, that’s part of the point in bringing public pressure to this. What website can folks go to, what’s your website?

DK: Our website is aresarmor.com. We have some promotional items on there specifically attempting to raise funding for lawyers. In the first week of it, we’ve spent in between $20-30k just in legal fees. This is going to be a very long and hard-fought battle coming up here. We are attempting to raise money to continue on with this.

SR: So when you have that legal defense fund set up and guys can donate straight to it, you’ll post that on your website?

DK: Yes we will. A lot of the updates we’re doing, we’re getting overloaded with phone calls and emails, a lot of the updates we’re doing we’re posting to our Facebook page. I know that’s kind of a silly place to post updates, but right now it’s the most efficient system we’ve got.

SR: That makes sense. Now the ATF filed an opposition to your TRO, and I believe you were supposed to file a response by today some time. What’s the current status of that?

DK: (0:13:14.2) I cannot discuss our legal strategy going forward. It’s one of those things, we are fighting them and we do have a plan that’s being set forth. I can’t get into any of those details. I can’t comment on specific details of the case.

SR: But you’ll post some of that information on your site once you do it?

DK: Yes, after things are filed and done, all that information is publicly available at that time. It’s one of those things, we can’t discuss exactly what we’re doing from a legal standpoint, because it gives our hand away.

SR: Yeah, you don’t want to do that. No sweat. Now the search warrant affidavit from the US Attorney, is that available somewhere online?

DK: It is not as of yet. We want that, that is a huge document that we want to get our hands on. As I said, that temporary restraining order was in effect when that search was executed, so they better be hoping that thing is air solid tight.

SR: Right. So what’s. The current status is you guys are still in business, you’re still selling your lowers. You’re selling the aluminum versions, correct?

DK: (0:14:33.8) Yes. Myself and several other employees put a lot of hours in this weekend to get the company back to operational status. We are still taking, shipping out orders on a daily basis right now. We’re back up and running. Our retail locations are operating on pen and paper for now, until our computers are returned to us by our guests that came by on Saturday.

SR: What’s interesting about this is you were in one of our meetings in your local area, an OK meeting, at the time, right?

DK: Yes sir. I was actually sitting in an OK meeting when the raid began. We left and I went up to our shipping and receiving building to facilitate the search warrant.

SR: But they were already cracking into your safe and breaking locks and busting stuff up, right?

DK: The building I was at, they were very cordial and professional. I have nothing bad to say about the specific agents at the facility I was at. Now it does seem that the buildings where I wasn’t, the same courtesies were not extended. They went in guns up in one of our buildings. They went into a room that had women and children in it with weapons drawn. In National City where there was a protest across the street, they didn’t wait for anybody to come down, they just smashed through the door. By the way, that wasn’t even their sledgehammer for christ’s sake. They used our own sledgehammer to break our own stuff. Isn’t that ridiculous?

SR: (0:16:08.1) Wow, that’s amazing. Tell us a bit more about the place where there were women and children present. What happened there?

DK: That was, there were women and children in two of our buildings, in the manufacturing facility and one of the employees had their daughter with them that day. In that place, they went in as if they were breaking through a building in Iraq. Like I said, they were breaching doors with their firearms at the ready, combat gliding around our buildings, like they were fighting the mujahedeen.

SR: They were all in plate carriers with M4s, looked like [garbled] contractors, right?

DK: Oh yeah. With helmets, the whole 9 yards. These guys are fantastic. Actually, one of the shirts we put up was to commemorate their brave victory over unarmed civilians.

SR: Let me ask you this, as a veteran, you served in Iraq, right?

DK: Yes sir. Iraq and Afghanistan.

SR: Compare what they did with that raid to what you did in Iraq and Afghanistan. Is it worse than the treatment you used when dealing with civilians in Iraq and Afghanistan? About the same? What’s the comparison?

DK: At our manufacturing building it was comparable. Coming through with your weapons at the ready against unarmed civilians that are in the, it’s ludicrous behavior. It was completely an unnecessary show of force by them, there was no reason for it. They knew exactly where the product was they were looking for, where the information was they were looking for. I was told by one of the agents there, obviously this is hearsay, one of them said if I wasn’t such, if I wasn’t talking to the media so much, I embarrassed them by, with the restraining order and these things. I publicly embarrassed them, that’s why they hit all of our buildings like that, they needed to make an example out of me.

SR: Interesting.

DK: The thing is, this agent also told me he was worried about talking to me because he knows that I talk to the press and things like that. That was a very nice compliment. They should be afraid of the people, they should be afraid of their actions being displayed publicly. The first thing they do when they come in to execute a search warrant. Let me tell you the very first thing do, they ask if there are cameras here. I said yes there are. They said can you turn them off? The very first thing is they want to turn off the cameras. We live in a society where our government tells us it’s okay to put a camera on every freaking street corner, on every freaking door, all over the place. You can’t walk from, you can’t go past the 7-11 without passing 16 different camera systems, right? And it’s for our safety, to make sure everyone’s on the up and up. Obviously, the excuse is you should have nothing to hide. Then why are you turning off security cameras while you’re executing a search warrant inside of a building. You should have nothing to hide. It’s one of these things, apparently what’s good for the goose is not good for the gander in this particular case. I can say this about the ATF, there’s a quote from a movie, one of my favorite quotes, the first time someone calls you a horse, you punch them in the nose; the second time someone calls you a horse, you call them a jerk; the third time someone calls you a horse, you go shopping for a saddle. Well guess what ATF, how many times do you need to be called a terrorist organization before you put some freaking burqas on and actually start blowing stuff up? I don’t understand how they can make any actions that are more terroristic than what they’re already doing. 

SR: (0:19:50.8) Yeah, it’s state-sanctioned intimidation. It’s like the mob approaching you with an offer you can’t refuse. You do what we want or we’re going to raid you.

DK: He comes over, ehh, when’s the last time you came to my house for coffee. You don’t show me respect. That’s exactly what it was. The only reason [garbled]

SR: [garbled] They rolled in Delta Force style and pointed M4s at women and children.

DK: Absolutely they did.

SR: Interesting. All for officer safety. Why not just blow the building [garbled]

DK: Yeah, officer safety. One of those women might have pulled on your arm. But don’t worry, you got enough [garbled] on your body to protect you from that too.

SR: What if somebody had reached for a phone or just anything? A teenage kid just doing something. They’re not trained in how to properly respond to dynamic searches. What if they had made one wrong move and they had blown away a kid? This is [garbled]

DK: All I can say is thank god no one was hurt. Here’s the other thing. To think this is happening on our own soil, it’s sad. There’s no way to explain it other than disappointment. Especially for the guys who have fought in foreign lands under the guise, what they actually think they’re doing is fighting for freedom, and you come back to your own home and you realize that your freedom is a joke. You’re enslaved, we’re enslaved in our own backyards, in our own living rooms. We’re enslaved by the crap we watch on tv, by our phones, by all these things that are put out there to entertain us and keep our eyes off what is really happening inside of our country.

SR: (0:21:47.9) This reminds me of the raid conducted in Tucson against the Marine veteran Jose Guerena. In that case [garbled]

DK: Absolutely. That was in the news for what, a week? [garbled]

SR: What’s that?

DK: That was in the news for like a week. Then all those officers defended their actions. I saw the video on that raid. You’re talking about the guy who was not even looking inside the building, he’s got a pistol wrapped around the corner, just pulling the trigger.

SR: Right, he’s standing in the doorway unloading his handgun. There was a mother and her child in the house at the time.

DK: Absolutely.

SR: The whole point of that was they could have, he worked a night shift at the mine, they could have detained him there and searched the house. They could have detained him on the way home. But they let him get to his house, get in bed, then do this dynamic raid because it’s fun. They kick in his door, he reacts like any one of us would have, pulled his AR out, and they filled him full of holes. And his AR was on safe. They found him dead with his AR on safe, the officers [garbled]

DK: (0:22:49.5) [garbled] The other thing that was interesting about that story, after they slaughtered that poor human being inside his house for no reason, they had shot so many rounds all over the place, they had to break into the neighbors’ houses to see if there was any additional casualties.

SR: Right, they had rounds all over the neighborhood, in houses all around there. This is what this reminds me of. It could have gone down the same way. What if one of your veteran employees, not knowing who’s barging in, not knowing if it was the cartel, had grabbed a rifle or a handgun. The same thing could have happened there or worse. This is the problem with them treating you

DK: [Garbled] This is a situation where they’re using way more force than was necessary to accomplish what they were doing. Especially when they knew ahead of time exactly where it was. Like I said.

SR: Well they could have just knocked on the door like a responsible civilized human being and said we have a search warrant. Okay, come on it do your search warrant. That’s all they had to do.

DK: Yeah. One of the agents had told me they had been briefed on our military history, military backgrounds. It was one of those things, I joked with them, I wear a tie for a living. We’re a legitimate business, we run an [garbled]

SR: That was one of the reasons they went in like that? You would think that would make them be even more careful to come across like they’re not a Mexican drug cartel kicking in your door.

DK: (0:24:14.5) Yeah, you would think. I guess that also shows you the level of respect that is shown to veterans inside this country.

SR: Right. They fear us and see us as the potential enemy. Which is what this is all about at the end of the day.

DK: That’s exactly what it is.

SR: Why do they want your customer list? They want to know who the switched on gun owners are who dare to manufacture their own AR, which is totally legal. They know it’s legal but they don’t like it and they want to suppress it. They want to find a way to find out who these people are, put them on a list, then chill, make them afraid. That’s why they want to raid you. They want your customers to be afraid to buy from you anymore. So the way to respond to this is to triple the sales. That’s what I think.

DK: We do have quite a few customers that are very very very upset that their information has been taken. There’s also a lot of people that are showing a huge amount of support for us. Here’s the thing, this could have gone down and nobody would have known about it, what was going on. That was the deal they put on the table for us. I think we did the best thing in the circumstance, which was we fought back with the legal means that are available to us.

SR: (0:25:31.2) Folks need to realize that any transaction that isn’t strictly cash, you can’t count on it being secure, not in today’s world. The guys who are worried about that should show up cash in hand. But I say that we should all be on the list. Put us all on the list and the list becomes useless. If every veteran and gun owner in America is on the list, so what, what are they going to do then? 

DK: Absolutely

SR: Anything else we can do for you before we part ways? Anything else you want to tell the guys out there, anyway they can support you besides writing letters to their politicians?

DK: The biggest thing is to support yourselves. If something happens in your area, where this overreaching government that we now live with, exists and wants to take its hand and jump into your personal life or do any of these other things to you, say something about it and get it out there and tell them no. These people aren’t used to hearing no, and they need to hear it more and more. Every single time they hear that word, it’s going to make them cringe. The consent of the governed is required for what these people are doing, and that consent is probably getting very close to running out, if they continue on with actions like this. So it’s one of those things, stand up for yourself, don’t let these people push you around.

SR: Well said. Thank you for coming on with us. We will make sure our folks get the videos and the links, they can check our website for that, and we’ll link to yours, they can go to your website and keep track of what’s going on, any updates, and how to donate when you get your legal defense fund set up. Appreciate your time. Thanks a lot.

DK: Thank you so much.

SR: Hey John, some follow up questions for you as our Southern California leader. Tell us what happened from your perspective on that day.

JO: (0:27:22.6) On the day of the raid? We had finally set up a South San Diego County chapter meeting, and we had heard already that Ares Armor was being investigated and intimidated by BATF. We had spoken to them about trying to broker some kind of peaceful resolution to protect the customer lists of Ares Armor and also get what BATF claimed they were looking for, which was any felons. We were trying to see if we could find a constitutional sheriff that might be willing to take it on, do background checks on the list and then only turn over anybody who might be a felon, versus turning over the entire customer list. We were going to talk about that at our meeting, we were proceeding to do that. But they had feared, and their worst fears came true, that BATF found a way to get around the TRO and break into their shop and confiscate their customer list as is, which seems to be their goal anyway.

SR: And the owners of the store were in your meeting and got the text message that their business was being raided. 

JO: That’s correct, we had 3 at our meeting. We had just started, they sat down, they were watching their cell phones, their security cameras through their cell phone, and they got a phone call because their burglar alarm had been set off. They looked at their phone and immediately had to leave to go protect their business. So what we did, after we had our 2 hour meeting at the VFW, we proceeded to head to the National City location of theirs. That’s a retail operation, to protest. Several people were concerned, one was Carol from the Sons of Liberty Riders, had organized an impromptu protest on Saturday, to protest what was going on. We had no idea that the BATF would be raiding when we went there. We told them we would join their protest after our meeting. We let everybody know about it. Since we had heard that they were raiding the Oceanside locations, we hurried to the National City location. When we got there, we found out ATF was already in the store. People there were filming them drilling into the safe and sledgehammering the safe. We filmed them coming out of the shop and asked them a couple pointed questions about what they were doing.

SR: (0:30:19.2) You asked them if any of them were involved in Fast and Furious.

JO: Yeah. We also asked them if we had to go to the Mexican drug cartels to obtain our polymer lowers now, since [garbled].

SR: Good work on that. That’s a good example of pretty fast response. I think that’s [cuts out] things like this occur, is that they should face public pressure. They should have veterans, gun owners, just Americans standing on the sidewalk to call them out what they’re doing. I think that has to happen, that is a useful protest.

JO: I agree. We felt good about it. There were 25 of us out there. It’s like, where was everybody else? At the beach? Getting their hair done?

SR: This is why you need phone trees in your community, you need to have a way to let folks know right away what’s going on.

JO: How intimidated would they have felt if there were 100 or 500 or 1000 people out there.

SR: Yeah.

JO: National City police would have had to come out and block the streets.

SR: That’s what should happen.

JO: That’s what should have happened. Then we get these bozos who make comments like oh you just let them take all their information out of the store. You didn’t really make a stand, you didn’t really do anything, they still got all the information and lower receivers.

SR: But where were they? How come they didn’t show up?

JO: I don’t know, maybe they’re too busy working on their [garbled]

SR: They’re getting their hair done.

JO: Yeah or doing too many keystrokes on their Facebook pages talking about how brave they want to be and how we’re wasting our time. It felt good facing off with the BATF. We let them know that we care, as Americans we care. As oath takers, we care, and we plan to honor our oath, and they should be shamed for not honoring theirs. That video’s available on our Facebook page already. It will be put onto the main page soon.

SR: Right, it will be on the main OK site today. As soon as we get done with this interview, I’ll make sure it’s up. For the guys out there that want to Monday morning quarterback, it’s like where were you? At least they showed up and made them walk the gauntlet. This is what should happen, for example when veterans are declared by the VA to be incompetent to manage their own affairs, or whatever. They say because of that they can’t own firearms, they send letters out. Whoever sends that letter out, they should have outside of their office a line of angry veterans letting them know what they think of them. And everyday when they go to work, they should have to walk past and look them in the eye and hear what they have to say. That’s a start, guys. At least do that. All you chest thumpers out there that talk about, why don’t you guys just go in there and stop them. Well let’s see you guys exercise the personal courage to go and get in their face, let’s see you do that first. If you can’t at least do that, don’t talk about it, don’t give us a bunch of crap about what we’re not doing. Good point. Alright, anything else about this situation or anything else you want to tell the guys?

JO: (0:33:52.1) We need to rally the San Diego chapter. We’ve got a great chapter going in Orange County and the inland empire, we need to get the San Diego chapter up and going. It’s one of the most important counties that there are in the US, with all the military bases. You’ve got Camp Pendleton, you’ve got the naval base, you’ve got the SEAL base. It’s a wealth of oath takers that we need to get the message out to. We’d like to get the billboard campaign going in the area, and we want to get more OK working on the CPT teams and working at reaching, teaching, and inspiring the oath takers to follow and honor their oath.

SR: How is the CPT program going down there? This is the community preparedness team effort we’re doing. How is that going in Southern California?

JO: We’re still doing more general training, in terms of preparation, food water, firearms training, etc. We’re still doing that. We’ve never stopped doing those types of activities since we’ve been around for 3 years, we’ve always incorporated preparedness, under Operation Sleeping Giant we were doing that. We are slowly forming people together that are in the same neighborhoods to work together and then to organize within their own local neighborhoods. It’s a slow process.

SR: (0:35:24.3) That’s actually the real point of it, to build neighborhood watches and get existing civic organizations like neighborhoods and churches and veterans halls, to organize within what already exists. That is the point. You’re right on track.

JO: Okay, that’s what we’re doing. We’re trying to stay on mission. We’re meeting twice a month, we get 80-100 people twice a month. Every meeting, we try to goad those people by telling them they’re not just making a difference by coming to the meeting, they actually have to do something between the meetings.

SR: Right, you have to. What I do is recruit them right on the spot. I put pressure on them. What did you do in the military, what was your MS? Guess what, you’re on the [garbled] team. Or hey what do you want to volunteer for, here are your options, pick one. If a guy can be a bump on a log, just sit in the audience and doesn’t want to do something, what’s he doing there? We don’t have passengers, we’re all crew. Like Boston Tea Party said in his Boston Gun Bible, liberty is a man of war, there are no pampered passengers, we’re all crew. Everyone’s gotta pick up an oar and row. So yeah, good job. Put pressure on them. Anything else from SoCal before we sign off?

JO: Nope. All is on mission. We just need to get our members off their keyboards and out into the streets and off to our meetings and preparing and training.

SR: Speaking of which, I think it’s a good idea for April 19, about a month from now, for all of us to plan on April 19, Minuteman FTX, a roll out and practice. Between now and then, you guys get squared away so you can, just like a reenactment of April 19, 1775, really grab their powder horn and their musket balls and their musket and went out the door with their hatchet, same thing here. Practice, get ready to be, on that day be ready to roll out within 5 minutes, jump in your truck and go do an FTX. Get together with other folks, practice communications, emergency medical, tactics. Just get out there and actually do something on that day. If you’re not at an Appleseed shoot, you should be doing some sort of a Minuteman deployment on that day, as a practice run. I think that’s the most useful thing to do on that day, rather than flapping my gums and waving signs and whatever else we do. Go do an FTX. Or incorporate that. If you’re going to some event, on the way there, make it a friggin deployment FTX. Throw your crap in the car that you would use if you were going to deploy, make that your dry run. What do you think John?

JO: I think that’s a great idea. We’ve been talking about doing that with the local Orange County preppers group. There’s a San Diego preppers group that we’ve hooked up with as well. We’ve talked about that very thing, we’ll see if we can do it for the 19th.

SR: Sure why not. Even if a guy simply throws his rifle and his manbag in the truck and then goes and deploys, goes out with some friends and goes shooting that day, at least he’s practicing getting his gear in hand within a certain amount of time and getting out of his front door. Alright, so we’ll work on that, we’ll figure out some exercises guys can do. If any of you have ideas on a fun exercise, when I announce this on a post, in the comments, lay it out, what would be a good thing for people to practice doing on that day. Full spectrum, not just guns but comms, medical, all that stuff. Okay, thanks for sticking up down there in Southern California John, supporting Ares Armor and those guys.

(Video screenshot: The White House)</p></div>
<p>I just got done watching Barack Obama’s “gun control” speech, embedded at the bottom of this column.  I’d like to share some impressions while they’re still fresh in my mind.</p>
<p>First, I thought it was supposed to be a “press conference”– what’s with the applause and standing ovations? Yeah, I know, that was a rhetorical question.</p>
<p>It was all emotional appeal– not one thing was in it to do anything but harass the “law-abiding,” bypass the representatives of the people through what I call “executive ordure,” meaning he has publicly defecated on “shall not be infringed.”</p>
<p>Naturally the whole thing was built on lies, which I’m sure many commentators will be pointing out  — a big one that stood out for me is that violent criminals use gun trusts to get around NFA. Anybody remember <strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130902002152/http:/www.examiner.com/article/nfa-firearms-collectors-group-initiated-atf-gun-trust-rule-change" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20130902002152/http:/www.examiner.com/article/nfa-firearms-collectors-group-initiated-atf-gun-trust-rule-change', 'what I wrote about that here');" target="_blank">what I wrote about that here</a></strong>?</p>
<blockquote><p>As for their concern that violent criminals are going to be using trusts and lawyers to skirt the law, ATF noted “the number of Forms … involving legal entities that are not Federal firearms licensees increased … to 40,700 in 2012.” Despite this, the only corroborating example ATF cited was where an applicant denied transfer of a silencer “subsequently applied to transfer the same silencer to a trust,” that was discovered and the application was denied. Further information about the specifics of the example and the likely danger this posed in terms of increasing violent crime risks were not provided.</p>
<p>“No criminal would subject themselves to notifying the ATF of their intent to purchase a machine gun, wait six – 12 months to be able to receive the firearm, pay a $200 tax, and pay an extra $10,000 – $20,000 to purchase a legal machine gun when illegal machine guns can be purchased or made easily without waiting or notifying the ATF,” Gun Trust Lawyer David M. Goldman wrote yesterday in a deconstruction of a so-called fact sheet from the White House. “This logic is flawed.”</p></blockquote>
<p>I expect to have more on a tangential issue to that later, something I’m not ready to talk about yet until I have a chance to go through the actual language of the actions with some advisers.  I’ll probably also wait for the hubbub to die down so those insights don’t get drowned out. Without meaning to be overly cryptic, a friend and colleague has suggested a unique unintended consequence, but I need time to work on that before deciding if a public elaboration is warranted. Plus there will be no shortage of other commentators covering absurdities like “smart guns,” or using federal agencies to do anti-gun agenda “science,” all travesties I’ve talked about many times before anyway.</p>
<div class="wp-caption alignright" id="attachment_9282" style="width: 285px"><a href="https://www.oathkeepers.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/ScreenHunter_02-Jan.-05-13.23.jpg"><img alt="ScreenHunter_02 Jan. 05 13.23" class="wp-image-9282" height="291" src="https://www.oathkeepers.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/ScreenHunter_02-Jan.-05-13.23.jpg" width="275"/></a><p class="wp-caption-text">If you’re going to exploit a dead teen, you might at least go to the trouble of making sure his name is spelled right.</p></div>
<p>However, there is a point that needs to be made, probably the most important one that I walked away with from this entire group grope. I noticed it when, at 1:17:50 in to the video, Obama was talking about <strong><a href="http://www.cnn.com/2015/12/19/us/zaevion-dobson-killed-shielding-girls-from-bullets/" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.cnn.com/2015/12/19/us/zaevion-dobson-killed-shielding-girls-from-bullets/', 'Zaevion Dobson');" target="_blank">Zaevion Dobson</a></strong>, a Knoxville 15-year-old reportedly killed while shielding three girls from bullets fired by gangbangers who are essentially immune to his edicts. Incidentally, the White House video misspelled Dobson’s first name — three times — meaning speech copy given to staff in advance to assist with closed captioning should have anticipated it. Classy – dance in a kid’s blood to exploit his death for political gain, and the damn office of the president can’t even be bothered to spell his name right:</p>
<blockquote><p>We are not asked to do what Xavian [sic] Dobson did. We’re not asked to have shoulders that big, a heart that strong, reactions that quick… I’m not asking people to have that same level of courage or sacrifice or love. But if we love our kids and care about their prospects, and if we love this country and care about its future, then we can find the courage to vote. We can find the courage to get mobilized and organize. We can find the courage to cut through all the noise and do what a sensible country would do.</p></blockquote>
<p>That’s significant. They think they can “community organize” our rights away, that the greatest sacrifice that will be required of them will be to vote. They believe that a majority can lawfully impose tyranny on a minority. In short, they believe that might makes right, and they intend to hold the monopoly on that.</p>
<p>Who here will comply? If ordered to register your guns, will you? How about if you’re ordered to turn them in? What level of courage, sacrifice and love are you willing to rise to?</p>
<p>That’s the key weakness of delusional sheep who do not even approach, let alone share that level of commitment.</p>
<p>The other significant point was what Obama said right afterward:</p>
<blockquote><p>That’s what we’re doing today, and tomorrow we should do more, and we should do more the day after that…</p></blockquote>
<p>The collectivists will never stop. They will never be satisfied.  After they have the guns, they’ll want something else.  They mean to rule. Cede a small point they have no rightful claim to in the name of “compromise” and they’ll gladly snap it up and then demand more.  And accuse you of being an extremist, a racist and worse if you balk.</p>
<p>And though the next significant Obama speech won’t happen until the 12<sup>th</sup>, that, my friends, is the true state of the union.</p>
<p>And now, let’s all sit back and watch another episode of The Obama Show:</p>

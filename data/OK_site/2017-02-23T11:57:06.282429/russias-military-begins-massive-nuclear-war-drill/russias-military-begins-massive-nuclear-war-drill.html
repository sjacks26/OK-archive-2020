<p><strong>While much Western attention has been bestowed on Russia’s  military buildup near Ukraine, Moscow also began a massive nuclear  offensive exercise on Thursday.</strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.ng.ru/armies/2014-03-26/6_strike.html" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.ng.ru/armies/2014-03-26/6_strike.html', 'According to the Russian daily Nezavisimaya Gazeta');">According to the Russian daily <em>Nezavisimaya Gazeta</em></a>, </span>on  Thursday Russia’s Strategic Missile Forces began a massive three-day  exercise involving 10,000 soldiers and 1,000 pieces of equipment from  more than 30 units. The major purpose of the drill, according to the  report—which cites multiple senior Russian military officers—is to  ensure Russia’s Strategic Missile Forces have sufficient readiness to  conduct offensive operations involving the massive and simultaneous use  of nuclear missiles.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>Global Security Newswire</em> previously carried a story on the nuclear exercise, also citing the <em>Nezavisimaya Gazeta</em> article. </span>GSN described the exercise as <strong>“as practice for a large-scale nuclear offensive.” </strong>It  added: “Exercise participants were set to position and prepare  missile-firing units for launch, and to practice various administrative  and support functions for the operation</p>
<p><strong>As Russia’s conventional military capabilities have  deteriorated following the collapse of the Soviet Union, Moscow has  become increasingly reliant on operationalizing its nuclear arsenal.</strong> This has been reflected in successive Russian security documents. For  example, Russia’s 1997 national security concept stated that Russia  would use its nuclear arsenal “in case of a threat to the existence of  the Russian Federation,” whether that threat came in the form of nuclear  weapons or from a conventionally superior military power.</p>
<p>This threshold was further lowered in <a href="http://www.armscontrol.org/act/2000_05/dc3ma00" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.armscontrol.org/act/2000_05/dc3ma00', 'Russia’s 2000 military doctrine');">Russia’s 2000 military doctrine</a>,  which was the first released during Vladimir Putin’s presidency. This  document said that Russia would use nuclear weapons “in response to  large-scale aggression utilizing conventional weapons in situations  critical to the national security of the Russian Federation.” This held  out the possibility that Russia would use nuclear weapons even if Russia  proper hadn’t been attacked. The same doctrine further noted that  Russia reserved the right to use nuclear weapons in response to the use  of any kind of weapons of mass destruction against it.</p>
<p><strong>Shortly before reassuming the Russian presidency for a third  term, Putin reaffirmed the importance he placed on Russia’s nuclear  forces in a number of articles and speeches. </strong>For example, in an op-ed article <a href="http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2012/02/21/being_strong" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2012/02/21/being_strong', 'in Foreign Policy magazine');">in <em>Foreign Policy</em> magazine</a>, Putin wrote: “We will, under no circumstances, surrender our strategic deterrent capability. Indeed, we will strengthen it.”</p>
<p><strong>Thus, this week’s massive offensive nuclear drill is in line  with the goals that Russia and Putin have been articulating for well  over a decade.</strong> It is also consistent with Putin’s <a href="http://thediplomat.com/2013/07/russia-holds-massive-military-drill-aimed-at-china-japan/" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://thediplomat.com/2013/07/russia-holds-massive-military-drill-aimed-at-china-japan/', 'recent emphasis on conducting more frequent');" target="_blank">recent emphasis on conducting more frequent</a> and sophisticated military drills to improve the combat readiness of Russian military forces. Indeed, Russia c<a href="http://thediplomat.com/2013/10/russia-conducts-surprise-nuclear-readiness-drill/" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://thediplomat.com/2013/10/russia-conducts-surprise-nuclear-readiness-drill/', 'onducted a much smaller surprise nuclear drill');" target="_blank">onducted a much smaller surprise nuclear drill</a> in October of last year.</p>
<p><strong>Still, the timing of the drill is likely to cause great concern in Western capitals, particularly in Washington. </strong>The  drill could very well be intended to signal Russia’s resolve over  events in Ukraine where Russia has been at loggerheads with the West and  the government in Kiev over Moscow’s annexation of Crimea. A very  visible reminder of Russia’s substantial nuclear capabilities would make  sense for Moscow in a number of different contingencies, including if  Russia is intending to move forces deeper into eastern Ukraine, as many  currently fear.</p>
<p>For what it’s worth, the <em>Nezavisimaya Gazeta</em> article said  there was no connection between the current nuclear exercise and the  crisis in Ukraine. As evidence of this, it pointed out that in December  of last year the commander of Russia’s Strategic Missile Forces had said  that his forces would conduct a large and complicated exercise sometime  during 2014. From this, the Russian daily concluded that the drill had  been planned for weeks and was completely unrelated to the tensions of  Ukraine.</p>
<p><strong>At the same time, it ended the article by noting that testing  the readiness of Russia’s strategic forces was especially important in  light of the “current reality of the world situation.”</strong></p></div>

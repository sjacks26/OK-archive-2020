SR: The judiciary of this country, over decades and generations, to honor their oath to defend the Constitution. That’s why we have to be here. I tell you what I saw today, like Sheriff Mack said, it was a posse. Those cowboys showed America how it’s done. You cowboy up and you friggin ride. That’s what they did. All of the credit and honor goes first and foremost to those guys on horseback and cowboy hats. I also want to say, a lot of credit also goes to militia guys that showed up today. You got militia members here from all over the country. You got folks from Montana, Arizona, I even saw a couple of guys from California, probably didn’t know there were guys from California who knew how to do it. They kitted out and rode up here also, and they jumped in. What we saw there was the people. It was the combined arms defense of the Constitution. You had stand-up legislators, stand-up lawmen – both current serving and former – show up. Right now, you’ve got Matt Shea driving down from Washington state with a delegation of Western legislators who are coming here to stand up. But you folks took care of it before they could even show up here. But they’re still on their way.

SR: (0:01:28.3) You also have in Nevada, you’ve got some good state legislature folks here as well. You’ve got Michelle Fiore, assemblywomen, she stepped up. She’s the first woman I called, I knew her from way back when, when I used to live here. I’m from Clark County myself, went to high school at Clark High School, then I went to UNLV. Long before that, like I said, when I turned 18 I joined the Army. Here today, due credit needs to go to the veterans who stepped up. I want to bring to the stage Charlie, one of the guys from Arizona, he’s an Army combat veteran, Airborne brother of mine. I want Charlie to come up here. I also want Steve Homan from Nebraska to come up, he’s a Marine, wounded combat veteran from Vietnam. These are the guys that you need to thank for showing up here and backing up the Bundy family and the cowboys when they took their stand. This is Charlie, that’s Steve. There’s a bunch of other vets out there in the crowd. They took their oath – 1965, right Charlie? Tell the folks about it.

Charlie: I took my oath for the US Army when I was 17. My folks had to sign for me at that time. I took that oath, I swore to protect and defend the Constitution of the US and the country from all enemies foreign and domestic. You know what, I don’t have an expiration date on that oath. I’m 66 right now, I don’t know how much longer I can keep doing it, but as long as I can get there, I’m there.

Steve: I took my oath in 1966. I went through my training just in time to hit Vietnam in 67, just when Tet was wrapping up. Wasn’t there very long. Got a medevac, came home, and seen a lot of shit going on, excuse my language, in this country. I experienced the flower children first hand. I had legionnaires make disparaging statements about our poor dope smoking veterans that couldn’t win a war, things like this. That’s not going to happen again. I’ve seen another cycle. These same flower children are running our government. At least their descendants. It’s the same people that I made up my mind, if I go to my grave, I will stand up whenever I can. I’ve got a lot of older veterans saying the same thing. People are finally coming up, it does my heart good to see people from all these states. This is what it’s going to take. We need people from every state. Take 2 days off from your job, whatever you have to do, and show up. Not have these rallies where we have 20 people trying to do 300’s work. This is doing my heart, if I go out tonight, by god, it was worth it.

SR: (0:04:41.1) What you have right there is what I would call a couple of dangerous old men. They don’t care anymore. All they care about is that their children and grandchildren are free. I remember Steve telling me when he first joined OK, he said if we’re going to get it on, let’s do it before I die. It does his heart good to see today the American people stand up from all walks of life, out here in the West. This is Westerners standing up and showing the rest of the country how it’s done. God bless you all. The credit goes to Mr. Bundy and his family and those cowboys and everybody else that stepped up and stood behind them. Let this be the beginning of the restoration of our Republic from the bottom up. It’s much more important to be here today than at any rally in Washington DC. Put the oath breakers in both political parties, you’ve got them in the Republican Party too, both parties, put them on notice that you’ve had enough and you’re coming for them to root them out of office. That’s all I have to say. I just want to say one thing more. What happened today was the choice between bending the knee and submitting and standing up and you folks stood up. Hooah.

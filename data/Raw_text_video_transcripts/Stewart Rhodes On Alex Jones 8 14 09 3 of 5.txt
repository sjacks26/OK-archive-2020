## Alex Jones; Stewart Rhodes

AJ: With all this background happening, and we have the SPLC coming out and viciously attacking you and I and other nationally. This report is being one of the top news stories the last 3 days on every major newscast. Does that creep you out, but at the same time make you proud that you’re having an effect to know that over and over, myself especially, get singled out as this enemy? The full government focus is on us, trying to demonize these town halls.

SR: That’s right. Here’s the bottom line, this is why I founded OK in the first place. The head is rotten. We have to focus from the bottom up, from the county level on up and our state legislatures. But we might run out of time. I founded OK to be sure or do the best we can to make sure that the troops will not follow the orders. And sure that threatens whatever they have intended for us. What could be wrong with us reaffirming our oaths unless they have bad plans, unless they have intentions to issue orders that we would not follow because they’re unconstitutional. I think the more they attack me, the more I know I’m doing what’s right. That’s how I look at it.

AJ: You made a great point. When we’ve got the government documents attacking us and Ron Paul and libertarians and returning veterans and gun owners, that is absolute proof that they are bad and that our analysis of their system was correct. My only apology Mr. Rhodes is that as bad as I said it was, I haven’t told the audience or fully grasped myself just how real this is. Intellectually knowing something is happening, intellectually knowing it hurts to be in a car wreck and flip your car is one thing, but actually being in the car, breaking your ribs, knocking your head off the window, getting 20 stitches is another thing. Intellectually I know getting the flu doesn’t feel good, but when you’re vomiting your guts out it’s a different thing. Can you comment on that? To actually see this happening.

SR: (0:02:12.4) Look back at HR 1955, the Jane Harmon proposal for radicalization and homegrown terrorism prevention act, where they wanted to set up centers of excellence to study people and send secret reports to Congress, remember that? She introduced that on April 19, 2007. Even back then, her real target was domestic enemies of regime.

AJ: For those who don’t know, that’s a police code. When they say April 19, that’s when the war started. Explain that to people.

SR: You bet. We stood on the Green in Lexington on April 19 to commemorate as all kinds of citizens do, to celebrate our heritage and reaffirm our oaths. But according to SPLC, that’s some kind of sinister indication that we are extremists. Supposedly, April 19 is the equivalent to celebrating OKC bombing. In their minds, if you do anything April 19, it makes you an extremist. Not an American.

AJ: The globalists hate America, that’s why they burned Waco on April 19 and used special forces against those children. We have the Congressional documents with Delta Force there. That’s why they bombed OKC on April 19, to take that day away from us. They want to take our sacred days, expropriate them and turn them into a day a victimization for their red coat system.

SR: (0:03:36.2) Right, they want to demonize it and erase our own history. So here’s what’s happening. What she wanted to do is being done anyway, even though the bill didn’t pass. SPLC is just another facet of that. They are acting as the Gestapo secret police wing, to go and label people. Instead of having the FBI do it directly, they do it for them. Then DHS feeds off their fake little reports and comes out with their own report. Then you’ve got SPLC citing the DHS report they helped write. It’s a vicious circle. The puppeteer has two puppets in his hand, it’s all the same puppet master. The whole point is to demonize, marginalize, make someone a target, make them outside of society’s protection, then they sic the dogs and the military on you, or the police at least.

AJ: That’s what Hitler and Lenin and Mao did. First for 4 or 5 years in every case, they demonize the group, then they go after you. We got the secret army document that regular army is watching us and Ron Paul, that became national news. The good news is it’s back firing, because the military is going why am I spying on Wayne Paul, on Alex Jones, on Ron Paul, on Stewart Rhodes? Why are we following around some little old lady handing out yard signs to end the Fed? I really think the establishment is trying to do the same thing the bankers funded in Russia, in China, in Germany. I don’t see it working.

SR: It’s not, it’s backfiring, because they cast such a broad. It becomes absurd, when anybody who disagrees with what’s going on, or anyone they can categorize as being anywhere on the political right is now a potential terrorist, it’s just ridiculous. The extremist lexicon defined an extremist as being the same as a terrorist, then it went down the list of all these so-called extremist groups. We’re all automatically terrorists, we’re just different stripes of terrorist. This person’s an anti-abortion terrorist, this person’s a free-border terrorist. They just label you different kinds of terrorist. But they pool us all together in one pool of extremist which means terrorist. It’s so broad and sweeping that anyone can see through it, see how ridiculous it is, unless they’re a partisan hack.

AJ: (0:06:03.6) You also notice that everybody they list in that DHS report are people that are following something that is constitutional. And it happens to be popular, 81% Gallup control the borders, demonized. Almost 80% say get rid of restrictive gun laws, we’re winning that fight, we’re terrorists. Upwards of 70% against abortion, so the majority of us are terrorist. This is an unpopular, it’s like national polls show 92% believe the government killed Kennedy now. So 8% is saying 92% of us are nuts, are terrorists. It isn’t going to work anymore. The feds might have been able to get away with blowing up their own federal building in 95, they might have been able to get away with that now. I want to caution the black op operators and the mercenaries and others, Cheney’s been caught for staging terror in the Middle East to blame it on enemies. It’s coming out about Blackwater. You guys aren’t going to get away with this, there are people on the inside that are going to blow the whistle from so many angles, you’re going to get caught. I really feel and intellectually see, the momentum has shifted. For leaders like you and myself, they may imprison us or kill us, but we’re actually fighting for America, in the final battle, in the main crossroads, so I’m not worried about it, it’s a great honor, I wish I had more lives to give. But for the people out there, if you simply take action, get the word out, expose the globalist, I don’t see us being defeated. Even if they blow up federal buildings, even if the feds set off a nuke, even if they realize some deadly flu. I’ve looked at this from every angle. If the people believe they can win, it’s over, we win.

SR: Absolutely. Here’s the thing, if we wake up enough of the police and military, then it’s game over for them. You can’t do these things without the willing compliance of the troops and police. If they have them on their side, it’s still not over for us, we can still fight. But certainly it’s better for us to have our brothers and sisters on our side. We have to make sure we get as many of them as possible. That’s our mission. Our next big push is going to be this Oath Keepers packet, including an OK guidebook and an OK tab for their uniform, we want to get those out to every single service member. We’re going to be doing a big money wave between now and November 11, which is Veterans Day. People can donate $30, and it will go right in the hands of a current serving service member. We have a new website, oathkeepers.org.

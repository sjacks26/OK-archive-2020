<content:encoded>I was in Viet Nam from November of 68 until July of 70.  I did not come back an angry man, but I DID become angry as I witnessed how I and many others were treated, especially any and all Americans who wanted only LIBERTY!  The testimonials above feed my soul and nourish my Spirit.  As far as organization goes, O.K.’s and all of us veterans surely lack in some ways.  But many of those short comings will melt away like the morning dew when the sun draws high.  There is something in our guts, as veterans, that becomes stronger, more, greater and intensified as tyranny becomes more and more conspicuous.  And I am sure that ALL LIBERTY loving Americans share that same feeling.  I KNOW that we as a people CANNOT perish.  Combat in Viet Nam brought out the good, the bad and the ugly, in all of us.  I believe that combat, here, on our own soil, will bring out only the best in every American who knows what it means to be an American.<br/>
I am grateful to O.K.’s for all that you do to keep this site up and running.  May we ALL speak out to EVERY service man or woman we see on the street and ask them….. have you heard of OathKeepers?  There are many who NEED to be told!<br/>
Thank you all for speaking your truth!<br/>

<content:encoded>You don’t stand for liberty and justice through armed occupation of someone else’s property.  Any philosophy, religion, or belief system that leads you and others to believe to the contrary is unadulterated bull shit.

<content:encoded>here ya go… a new method of fast response to federal harrassment going on against the residents of Burns, Oregon…
<p>actually, a VERY good idea….</p>
<p>get roving crews out there with video equipment, and post a number residents can call for immediate response to harrassment!!! Get these federal bastards all on record, and then start publishing it en mass…</p>
<p>get this out there, a new and completely legal way, to defend the constitution, protect the citizens of Burns, Oregon from continued federal harrassment, and begin making the crimes committed against the people in Burns a nationally understood dilema…</p>
<p>Make the call !</p>

<content:encoded>There is a long, 6 part article that was done by Dr. Michael Coffman, in 2014, that everyone needs to read and make copies of and get it circulated to everyone. The title is: “The Bundy Standoff-A Century of Abuse”..His research is impeccable, as he takes us back in to the history of America and states joining the union, etc…lots of legal information in it. It is at <a href="http://www.newswithviews.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.newswithviews.com</a> (where Dr. Edwin Vieira has his articles)Here is the direct website:  <a href="http://www.newswithviews.com/Coffman/mike147.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.newswithviews.com/Coffman/mike147.htm</a>  Dr. Coffman is the one who did the map on the Wildlands project (of Agenda 21), where the US. is divided into wildlands and the human beings are removed….just google, map of wildlands project by Dr. Michael Coffman…  For those who do not really know about Agenda 21, Tom Deweese writes at newswithviews;and no one knows it any better.It will affect us all, and is adverse to our liberty. And, I want you to read what the late, great Derry Brownfield wrote. Title of the article, “Our land…collateral for the national debt”. direct website: <a href="http://www.newswithviews.com/brownfield/brownfield59.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.newswithviews.com/brownfield/brownfield59.htm</a>  Would someone get a copy of these articles to Ammon…and I wish Stewart would highlight again, the videos of  Ammon being tazered by the BLM…3 times, I believe…and the other video of the cowboys and other Bundy supporters, riding to free the cattle..and facing the armed BLM that is telling them that they need to leave, or they will shoot them. All of America needs to see that….and so many have not. thanks for all oathkeepers does, and others.

<content:encoded>The issues are a just cause and this presents as yet another clear illustration of why the situation should be supported…morally, openly, vocally and by any other means that individuals choose. 
<p>This is not and was not an armed revolt, nor a call for one. </p>
<p>It is a necessary stand by principled free men who are DEFENDING Liberty and DEFENDING the Constitution and who are putting their lives on the line to illustrate clear anti-Liberty/anti-Constitution Federal Govt excesses, whilst comparing and contrasting those clear and specific excesses with the textual limitations of the Constitution…those limitations which were and are specificaly and clearly designed and enumerated to strictly limit the Federal Govt, not to empower it.</p>
<p>The issues are crystal-clear and setting aside turf-issues and other personal/personnel issues, the cause and the stance is also dirt-simple.</p>
<p>This should be a cause that all free men can rally around, if not physically then supportively in other manners. </p>
<p>Yeah, yeah…I know that there are suspect and unsavory characters involved and that those characters have and continue to be used as scant cover as to why support should be withheld. </p>
<p>Yeah, yeah…I know that many find the initial methods and operational approach objectionable and that since the sturdy and steadfast citizens of the County did not rise up enmass, embrace the cause and declare solidarity, that this also has been an oft used reason as to why support should not be provided.</p>
<p>So…these men and the issues they are raising have been largely abandoned and left to whatever their fate may be.</p>
<p>News flash….this particular contest has been engaged…the players are who they are…yet the issues are just and proper….so then, the choice remains.</p>
<p>Do people abandon the just cause that is already engaged and retrench to the tall weeds to prepare and await an ideal ‘silver-platter’ scenario before shoving aside computers and their fiery rhetoric…or…do people make the best of what started as an imperfect and questionable adventure undertaken in what was seen as ‘suspect’ circumstances and assess that the circumstances are what they are yet the issues and the cause is valid and just, subsequently becoming vocal and supportive and remaking this turd into an exaple of the advancement of LIberty and the proper shoving back of Federal Leviathan?</p>
<p>Such tough decisions….</p>
<p>And so continues the fall of the Republic and the loss of Liberty itself.</p>

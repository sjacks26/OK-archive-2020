<content:encoded>Since 1989 I felt that something bad was coming to us all.  I didn’t know when, but knew is was coming.  Since that time I have prepared for that which I don’t know.  Now I feel that it is coming tomorrow.

<content:encoded>I am a Global War on Terror vet, was an Electronics tech, law enforceament, and a NRA certified/USN certified weapons and tactics instructor.  Looking to join something that will give me a sense of purpose again.  I can be an asset as I still teach people how to shoot and shoot a lot better than most in the community.  Pistol, shotgun and tactical rifle are my specialty. Look forward to hearing from someone soon!

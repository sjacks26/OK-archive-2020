<content:encoded>I agree with you totally Brandon.  We cannot let fear stop us from saving our nation or being prepared for any disaster.  Our CPT teams are what is going to protect and save WE THE PEOPLE.  For those who do not want to participate, I ask what are your plans?  What do you fear?  We need to make communities strong now!

<content:encoded>Well done, Brandon! A few comments for others to consider:
<p>True Leadership is not about commanding, but encouraging, and leading by example.</p>
<p>It is fear that keeps us locked in the Matrix, which is the mechanism used to control us. You can’t eliminate fear, for fear is natural. It is to be put aside, and to continue, just as any warrior knows. </p>
<p>Just do it. Begin your move to self-sufficiency by taking another step forward, no matter how small. A journey is composed of many steps. Each step needs to be taken.</p>

<content:encoded>Great article! Everyone who served in the military to an oath to support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic. Why join OK if you had no intentions to act on your oath if it became necessary? MAN UP!

<content:encoded>Brandon, you may not realize it but you just described our legitimate government (mostly) here:
<p>“we can conclude that to develop a strong organization, the ideal must be honest and honorable, the plan must be decentralized and natural for individuals to implement, and those who coordinate the organizational efforts must do so with the realization that they are stewards of the principles of that movement and that those principles are more important than their glory. If activists plan to become followers of anything, it should be solid principles. Leaders are secondary.”</p>
<p>Under the US Constitution small groups of “government” were created, one a general government to handle specific things like dealing with foreign affairs, seeing that the state traded fairly with each other, and PROTECTING individual rights.</p>
<p>They were to be little pockets that the people sent in THEIR  representatives from each state to deal as a group for all the states implementing the peoples wishes regarding foreign affairs. What is required to become a citizen of the USA for LAWFUL immigrants and implementing that.</p>
<p>The states were to deal with little pockets of things that might concern all – major roadways, people allowed to come and STAY within the USA. (Actual citizenship requirements was created within the general government so that each state would not have different requirements and whenever one moved to another state they would then have to go through different citizenship requirements.) </p>
<p>EVERYTHING else was to be done and decided by the people themselves.  So much today is lawless, color of law, and NOT Constitutional.</p>
<p>Great job to show how the US Constitution is the example for the defense of our nation from traitors and domestic enemies – meaning to or not.</p>
<p>Cal</p>
<p>God Bless! Molon Labe! Stay Safe everyone!</p>
<p>If there were never intended to be action to defend the Constitution from those who are domestically attempting to destroy its power and authority, why would each Oath require it of those who take the Oaths?</p>
<p>“It is the nature of a right that it is – and must be – absolute. If there are codicils, appendices, restrictions, however, and buts, then it is a privilege, granted and controlled by others.” Unknown</p>

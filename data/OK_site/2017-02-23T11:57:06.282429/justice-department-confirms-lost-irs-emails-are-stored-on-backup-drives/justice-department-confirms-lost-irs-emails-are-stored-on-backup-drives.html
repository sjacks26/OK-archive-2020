<p><em>This article was written by Mac Slavo and originally published at <a href="http://www.shtfplan.com/headline-news/jaw-dropping-revelation-justice-department-confirms-lost-irs-emails-are-stored-on-backup-drives_08262014" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.shtfplan.com/headline-news/jaw-dropping-revelation-justice-department-confirms-lost-irs-emails-are-stored-on-backup-drives_08262014', 'SHTFplan.com');">SHTFplan.com</a></em></p>
<p>For weeks the IRS and Obama Administration told the American people a   carefully crafted narrative regarding the whereabouts of emails   containing information surrounding the targeting of specific groups and   individuals based on their political party. The Obama administration   vehemently denied that such targeting had taken place or that they had   any involvement whatsoever. For their part, IRS heads testified that the   thousands of emails belonging to director Lois Lerner, who headed the   IRS Exempt Organizations Unit, simply disappeared when her hard drive   was thrown away.</p>
<p>Most Americans simply couldn’t believe it. How could an agency that   deals with billions of pages worth of tax returns simply lose emails,   especially from a department head? Moreover, how is it possible that   these emails were not backed up somewhere?</p>
<p>In June we opined that there <a href="http://www.shtfplan.com/headline-news/bombshell-we-know-the-whereabouts-of-lost-irs-emails_06192014" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.shtfplan.com/headline-news/bombshell-we-know-the-whereabouts-of-lost-irs-emails_06192014', 'must be secondary copies');" target="_blank">must be secondary copies</a> of these emails, simply because the government keeps records of   everything. Could you imagine what would happen to the IRS if their main   email or data server was destroyed by some far off event, and all of   the government’s tax revenues for an entire year were lost? Of course   not! It’s simply not a reasonable scenario.</p>
<p>It turns out, <a href="http://www.thedailysheeple.com/lies-exposed-doj-admits-missing-irs-emails-do-exist_082014" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.thedailysheeple.com/lies-exposed-doj-admits-missing-irs-emails-do-exist_082014', 'according to a new report');" target="_blank">according to a new report</a>, that the government does have backups.</p>
<p>The Department of Justice has confirmed it.</p>
<p>But there’s a catch. DOJ attorneys and the IRS are now scrambling to   offer up an excuse for why they shouldn’t have to show them to the   American public.</p>
<p>If you’re not upset at government overreach and lack of transparency yet, then this should seal the deal.</p>
<p>The government says that the problem with accessing the emails is   that it would be too “onerous” of a task. Yes, you read that right. They   do not want to source the emails because it would be difficult and   burdensome.</p>
<p>Or, is there a second possible explanation for their lack of   motivation? Could it be that pulling the emails would result in   handcuffs and stiff prison sentences for officials involved in the   conspiracy at not only the IRS, but the Treasury Department, the   Department of Justice, the Federal Elections Committee and even the   White House?</p>
<p>The records exist. Now they need to be shown to the American public,   and if there was any wrongdoing, people need to be sent to prison, up  to  and including the President of the United States.</p>

<hr/><strong>Lies Exposed: DOJ Admits “Missing” IRS Emails DO Exist</strong><br/>
<em>By Lily Dane (<a href="http://www.thedailysheeple.com/" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.thedailysheeple.com/', 'The Daily Sheeple');" target="_blank">The Daily Sheeple</a>)</em>
<p>In a stunning turn of events, Department of Justice attorneys for the   IRS admitted that Lois Lerner’s emails DO exist on a backup server,  but  said they would be hard to find.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.judicialwatch.org/press-room/press-releases/54245/" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.judicialwatch.org/press-room/press-releases/54245/', 'Judicial Watch');" target="_blank">Judicial Watch</a> President Tom Fitton broke the news today:</p>
<blockquote><p>Department of Justice attorneys for the Internal Revenue  Service  told Judicial Watch on Friday that Lois Lerner’s emails, indeed  all  government computer records, are backed up by the federal government  in  case of a government-wide catastrophe.  The Obama administration   attorneys said that this back-up system would be too onerous to search.    The DOJ attorneys also acknowledged that the Treasury Inspector  General  for Tax Administration (TIGTA) is investigating this back-up  system.</p>
<p>We obviously disagree that disclosing the emails as required would be   onerous, and plan to raise this new development with Judge Sullivan.</p>
<p>This is a jaw-dropping revelation.  The Obama administration had been   lying to the American people about Lois Lerner’s missing emails. There   are no “missing” Lois Lerner emails – nor missing emails of any of the   other top IRS or other government officials whose emails seem to be   disappearing at increasingly alarming rate. All the focus on missing   hard drives has been a diversion. The Obama administration has known all   along where the email records could be – but dishonestly withheld this   information. You can bet we are going to ask the court for immediate   assistance in cutting through this massive obstruction of justice.</p></blockquote>
<p>Remember, back in June, IRS officials told Congress that the emails   were lost and that the agency had gone to “great lengths” to try to   retrieve them.</p>
<p>Conveniently, the <a href="http://www.thedailysheeple.com/unbelievable-the-irs-claims-to-have-lost-lois-lerner-emails_062014" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.thedailysheeple.com/unbelievable-the-irs-claims-to-have-lost-lois-lerner-emails_062014', 'emails lost');" target="_blank">emails lost</a> were mainly  ones to and from people outside the IRS, such as the White  House,  Treasury, Department of Justice, FEC, or Democrat offices.</p>
<p>The shocking information was provided to Judicial Watch by order of <a href="http://www.thedailysheeple.com/two-federal-judges-lay-smackdown-on-irs-over-lost-emails_072014" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.thedailysheeple.com/two-federal-judges-lay-smackdown-on-irs-over-lost-emails_072014', 'U.S. District Judge Emmet G. Sullivan');" target="_blank">U.S. District Judge Emmet G. Sullivan</a>,   who, back in July, ordered the IRS to provide a declaration explaining   exactly how the agency managed to “lose” two years’ worth of emails   belonging to Lois Lerner.</p>
<p>Fitton spoke to Fox News about the revelation:</p>
<p><a href="http://youtu.be/_OBdIQK2gRA" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://youtu.be/_OBdIQK2gRA', 'httpv://youtu.be/_OBdIQK2gRA');">httpv://youtu.be/_OBdIQK2gRA</a></p>

<p>Hey, remember when Obama told Bill O’Reilly that there’s <a href="http://www.thedailysheeple.com/relax-conservatives-obama-says-theres-not-even-a-smidgen-of-corruption-in-the-irs_022014" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.thedailysheeple.com/relax-conservatives-obama-says-theres-not-even-a-smidgen-of-corruption-in-the-irs_022014', '“not even a smidgen of corruption”');" target="_blank">“not even a smidgen of corruption”</a> in the IRS?</p>
<p>Those words are coming back to haunt him.</p>

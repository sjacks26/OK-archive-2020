<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Editor’s Note:</strong> I am both pleased and grateful that <strong>The Sullen Bell</strong> has spared me the task of outlining the content of the first three parts of this series on JADE HELM 2015.  Readers who have not already read the previous installments may quickly refer to The Sullen Bell for an outline synopsis. I will leave this window open for you, so you can click back and forth as you wish.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.thesullenbell.com/2015/06/16/warfare-on-domestic-politics/" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.thesullenbell.com/2015/06/16/warfare-on-domestic-politics/', 'http://www.thesullenbell.com/2015/06/16/warfare-on-domestic-politics/');" target="_blank"><strong>http://www.thesullenbell.com/2015/06/16/warfare-on-domestic-politics/</strong></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Again I must reiterate that this series of articles is not an official Oath Keepers statement of policy, but instead is simply an open letter from your editor to Oath Keepers members and friends. Also, please be advised that at the bottom of this article is the mind-blowing video from John B. Wells’ <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqGEz9IqOrE" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqGEz9IqOrE', 'Caravan To Midnight –');" target="_blank"><em><strong>Caravan To Midnight –</strong></em></a>– <em><strong>episode 309: Jade Helm Decoded</strong></em>, in which John B. Wells hosts the astonishing mystery lady, “DJ”. If you do not read any of these four articles, at least scoll down to that video link and treat yourself to the most comprehensive knowledge available to date on JADE HELM 2015 in a perspective which, imo, renders JADE HELM 2015 more of a symptom than the problem itself. Readers who have actually followed this series of articles and absorbed all the background materials I’ve included will have the best possible perception with which to comprehend the message John B. Wells’ anonymous guest “DJ” has broadcast.  Patience is not only a virtue, it is a necessity in trying to understand our modern world and the inherent threats to our lives and liberty. I want to thank each of you who have diligently waded through this series. And I should say, I have deleted a lot of material which actually should be included, for the sake of brevity. I will probably edit-in more material in coming times.</p>

<p><strong>Parts</strong> &lt;<a href="../index.html?p=5999" target="_blank"><em><strong>one</strong></em></a>&gt; <strong>and</strong> &lt;<a href="../index.html?p=6282" target="_blank"><em><strong>two</strong></em></a>&gt; <strong>touched upon these basics:</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><strong>1) The fact that JADE HELM 2015 is an Unconventional Warfare exercise;</strong><br/>
<strong>2) The fact that UW includes PSYOP and Civil Affairs activity;</strong><br/>
<strong>3) The fact that Civil Affairs involves cultural anthropology and social study;</strong><br/>
<strong>4) The Army’s Unconventional Warfare listing of “INSTRUMENTS OF NATIONAL POWER”;</strong><br/>
<strong>5) The Globalists’ view of the “Impact of Global Political Awakening” (by we the little people);</strong><br/>
<strong>6) The economic effects of the military-industrial complex activity on the U.S. economy;</strong><br/>
<strong>7) The fact of complicity between the UN’s NGO operations such as Agenda-21 and government’s perceived need to control its population while Agenda-21 initiation is in process;</strong><br/>
<strong>8) Asymetric Warfare and its relation to Unconventional, Special, and Irregular Warfare;</strong><br/>
<strong>9) The creation of perpetual war by creating new enemies one after another;</strong><br/>
<strong>10) The military’s interface/merger with local police through DHS’ Fusion Centers;</strong><br/>
<strong>11) Social planners’ concerns and confronting problems which would occur if permanent peace were to break out;</strong><br/>
<strong>12) DHS profiling of American citizens, with help from SPLC;</strong><br/>
<strong>13) Government-sponsored false flag events, such as were proposed in the Northwoods Document of 1962 at the Pentagon;</strong><br/>
<strong>14) Mapping the Human Terrain and “Mastering The Human Domain”;</strong><br/>
<strong>15) Training scenarios targeting the Tea Party and/or Constitutionalist citizens.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Part &lt; <a href="../index.html?p=6420" target="_blank"><em>three</em></a> &gt; added this bouquet of dots to be connected:</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><strong>16) The 1980 US Army document named “From PSYOP To MindWar”.</strong><br/>
<strong>17) The 2013 published book entitled “MindWar”.</strong><br/>
<strong>18) We remembered the Army’s use of the term “NATIONAL POWER” in their 2008 manual on Unconventional Warfare (which is the type of exercise JADE HELM 2015 is conducting, according to ARSOF’s announcement.)</strong><br/>
<strong>19) Self ownership, including ownership of one’s own mind, the importance of that.</strong><br/>
<strong>20) Unconventional Warfare (UW), Irregular Warfare (IR), and MindWar (MW).</strong><br/>
<strong>21) The two types of “mind”: The individual mind and the group mind.</strong><br/>
<strong>22) The Quantum properties of conscious awareness (this we only linked subtly to as an url under a photograph, which leads to <a href="https://diplopi.wordpress.com/2013/09/17/does-consciousness-arise-from-quantum-processes-in-the-brain/" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'https://diplopi.wordpress.com/2013/09/17/does-consciousness-arise-from-quantum-processes-in-the-brain/', 'diplopi ');" target="_blank"><em>diplopi</em> </a>). &gt;&gt;&gt;embedded link: <a href="https://diplopi.wordpress.com/2013/09/17/does-consciousness-arise-from-quantum-processes-in-the-brain/" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'https://diplopi.wordpress.com/2013/09/17/does-consciousness-arise-from-quantum-processes-in-the-brain/', 'https://diplopi.wordpress.com/2013/09/17/does-consciousness-arise-from-quantum-processes-in-the-brain/');" target="_blank">https://diplopi.wordpress.com/2013/09/17/does-consciousness-arise-from-quantum-processes-in-the-brain/</a></strong><br/>
<strong>23) The reality that our ability to think as individuals is now under attack by our government.</strong><br/>
<strong>24) The book “Propaganda” by Edward Bernays with a couple of quoted passages therefrom.</strong><br/>
<strong>25) The framers’ concept of “Nature or Nature’s God”.</strong><br/>
<strong>26) President Obama’s support of indefinite detention.</strong><br/>
<strong>27) John Whitehead on the militarization of America.</strong><br/>
<strong>28) The government’s use of propaganda as exemplified by the classic old film “Reefer Madness”.</strong><br/>
<strong>29) Psychotronic research for military purposes in PSYOP.</strong><br/>
<strong>30) DARPA’s brain-machine interface studies and DARPA military helmet prototypes.</strong><br/>
<strong>31) The NIJ’s 1997 report on the Partnership between law enforcement and the military.</strong><br/>
<strong>32) OOTW (Operations Other Than War).</strong><br/>
<strong>33) The merger of U.S. military with Canadian military.</strong><br/>
<strong>34) Iran-Contra-Mena scandal as a black-op by the Intelligence community.</strong><br/>
<strong>35) A video revealing that the author of MindWar (both the paper and the book) is Michael Aquino.</strong><br/>
<strong>36) We exposed the obvious fallacy of logic in Aquino’s paper regarding PSYOP during the Viet Nam War by revealing the hidden history about U.S. military relations with Ho Chi Minh in World War II when he was our ally.</strong><br/>
<strong>37) ELF waves and their appeal to PSYOP/MindWar operatives (PsyWarriors).</strong></p>
<p>All of those sub-topics needed to be put in place before we could look from an over-view perspective at the marvelous conceit of our General government’s nefarious plan — Yea, indeed, “<em>conspiracy</em>“! —  to enslave every American and even every human being on the planet. JADE HELM 2015 is a very small aspect of the much larger goal of conquest being even now executed within the collective consciousness of mankind. As we’ll see, the MAIN CORE list is merely for we who are awake, that we may be dealt with <em>before</em> the general population wakes up to what is happening to our world.  That said, let’s recall something I published on April 02, 2015 — the Caravan To Midnight show in which John B. Wells hosted Patrick Wood of the August Forecast &amp; Review.</p>
<p><a href="../index.html?p=5854" target="_blank"><em><strong>https://www.oathkeepers.org/technocracy-rising-patrick-wood-on-caravan-to-midnight/</strong></em></a></p>
<p>Let’s quickly recall some facts from that unforgettable show as presented by Patrick Wood:</p>
<p>Patrick’s new book is “<a href="http://www.technocracyrising.com/" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.technocracyrising.com/', 'Technocracy Rising');" target="_blank"><em><strong>Technocracy Rising</strong></em></a>“.  &gt;&gt;&gt;embedded link: <a href="http://www.technocracyrising.com/" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.technocracyrising.com/', 'http://www.technocracyrising.com/');" target="_blank"><em><strong>http://www.technocracyrising.com/</strong></em></a></p>
<p>On John B. Wells’ Caravan To Midnight show and in the book Patrick Wood lays out the obscure underbelly of the Trilateral Commission and their revival, in secrecy, of something Patrick Wood alone discovered — TECHNOCRACY.  Wood shows us that the Trilateral Commission has absorbed our government from within, and that our government is now being used to destroy American sovereignty, our value system, our moral codes, our culture, our social institutions, and indeed our very lives as free Americans. This is being done to establish their pet project — the transformation and trans-positioning of America into a “New Economic International Order”.</p>
<p><strong>Wood lists seven of their primary targets as being:</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><strong>1. Economics</strong><br/>
<strong> 2. Government</strong><br/>
<strong> 3. Religion</strong><br/>
<strong> 4. Law</strong><br/>
<strong> 5. Energy</strong><br/>
<strong> 6. Humanity</strong><br/>
<strong> 7. Christianity</strong></p>
<p><strong>“Who” is to do all this “transforming”? 1) the Trilateral Commission; 2) Technocracy; 3) the United Nations; and 4) Non-Government Organizations (NGOs).</strong></p>
<p>We note that neither the American People nor the Congress of the United States of America are party to the transformation. Technocracy and Trilateralism and the United Nations and Non-governmental organizations are the four horses on which the New International Economic Order is riding into our lives. Keep that in mind as we go.</p>
<p>Mr. Wood gives us things to notice, things being used by Technocracy to “transform” us:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><strong>1. Agenda 21</strong><br/>
<strong> 2. sustainable development</strong><br/>
<strong> 3. smart meters</strong><br/>
<strong> 4. climate change</strong><br/>
<strong> 5. cap and trade</strong><br/>
<strong> 6. the Green Economy</strong><br/>
<strong> 7. Human enhancement (Trans-Humanism: the merger of man and machine, literally)</strong></p>
<p>Please do, if you’ve not already done so,<a href="../index.html?p=5854" target="_blank"><em><strong> click this link</strong></em></a> and take time to view the Caravan To Midnight interview and read my report on that interview. We are almost to the end of my initial series on JADE HELM 2015, and this fourth installment will be the longest thus far, so I must Salute! all diligent readers who give themselves permission to read what has been presented, for you in doing so reveal that you want to know the full truth behind the <em>symptom</em> called JADE HELM 2015. Thank you for investing your hours to absorb all of this information. As Sir Francis Bacon once said, <em>“Knowledge is power.”</em></p>
<p><strong>Feel the power as you enjoy the truth, for the truth shall set us free.</strong></p>

<p> </p>
<h3><strong>National Emergencies</strong></h3>
<p>Throughout this article in its entirety, first and foremost remember these words by Dr. Edwin Vieira, Jr., taken from his book, “<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Three-Rights/dp/0967175968/ref=pd_sim_14_3?ie=UTF8&amp;refRID=0QJF1NHQNBYPWJJWBTCA" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.amazon.com/Three-Rights/dp/0967175968/ref=pd_sim_14_3?ie=UTF8&amp;refRID=0QJF1NHQNBYPWJJWBTCA', 'Constitutional Homeland Security: Part One: The Nation In Arms');" target="_blank"><em><strong>Constitutional Homeland Security: Part One: The Nation In Arms</strong></em></a>”. On page 12 he states:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong><em>“…the doctrine of ‘emergency powers’ runs afoul of America’s Constitution… Anyone who bothers to read the Constitution will see that it:</em></strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><strong><em>     Delegates to the General Government as a whole – or to Congress, the President, or the Supreme Court separately – no ‘emergency powers’ under that rubric;</em></strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><strong><em>     Delegates neither powers that only an ‘emergency’ can call into existence, nor powers that may be exercised only in an ‘emergency’;</em></strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><strong><em>     Delegates no power even to declare that an ‘emergency’ exists; and, perhaps most decisively of all,</em></strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><strong><em>     Does not even employ the word ‘emergency’, let alone define it as a legal principle relevant to any part of ‘the supreme Law of the Land’.”</em></strong></p>
<p>That one passage from Dr. Vieira’s book goes to our most central hope for undoing the tremendous damages to America which have been done in the name of the so-called “War on Terror”.  Wisdom shall bear in mind the uncomfortable fact that power-mad politicians on both sides of the aisle have always sought to increase illegitimate government power by crying “<em>Emergency!</em>”</p>
<p>Yes, there can be “emergencies”. But No, the General government in Washington D.C. (WDC) does not gain some magical new power to attack our Bill of Rights just because an <em>emergency</em> occurs.  If – for example – in a hypothetical situation in which unscrupulous politicians and government officials wished to involve America in an otherwise neutral war somewhere, or if they wished to exercise more control over the behavior of society, or if they wished to install a military-police state under martial law in America, or if they wished to take America fully into a one-world government via the United Nations and control or limit popular dissent against that, their first step would be to employ black-ops Intelligence community operatives to create a <em>pretext</em> and then they would cry “national emergency”. Peak events of Twentieth Century America show this clearly.</p>
<p>The notion that an emergency of some kind should somehow suddenly suspend the Constitutional way of setting and administering policy in a branch, department, or agency of the General government in Washington D.C. is used to justify a violation of Constitutional law by those verily foresworn to uphold the Constitution. The Constitution makes no provision for its own suspension.</p>
<p>So the ruse called “Emergency”, and especially the usurpation called “Emergency Powers”, holds no gravity, has no lawful basis, has no authorization, and is not granted in and by the Constitution for federal-level governance. Yet the General government in WDC is operating under the guise of “emergency powers” now, for its own protection and perpetuation, and trampling its own founding legal charter in a tryst of tyranny based on imagined authority which does not lawfully exist. I shall give an example from the Legislative Branch and one from the Executive Branch, to reveal just how Gov employees think:</p>
<p>(Note please – the bill below was only <em>introduced</em> to Congress, and did not get passed into law so far as I know at present. I am including it merely to demonstrate the abnormal perceptions of our policy makers. This bill shows how Govlish-minded politicians think.)</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">111th CONGRESS<br/>
1st Session<br/>
H. R. 645<br/>
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES<br/>
January 22, 2009</h2>
<p> </p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><strong>A BILL</strong><br/>
To direct the Secretary of Homeland Security to establish national emergency centers on military installations.<br/>
1. Short title<br/>
This Act may be cited as the “National Emergency Centers Establishment Act”.<br/>
2. Establishment of national emergency centers<br/>
(a) In general<br/>
In accordance with the requirements of this Act, the Secretary of Homeland Security shall establish not fewer than 6 national emergency centers on military installations…</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">(b) Purpose of national emergency centers<br/>
The purpose of a national emergency center shall be to use existing infrastructure—<br/>
(1) to provide temporary housing, medical, and humanitarian assistance to individuals and families dislocated due to an emergency or major disaster;<br/>
(2) to provide centralized locations for the purposes of training and ensuring the coordination of Federal, State, and local first responders;<br/>
(3) to provide centralized locations to improve the coordination of preparedness, response, and recovery efforts of government, private, and not-for-profit entities and faith-based organizations; and<br/>
(4) to meet other appropriate needs, as determined by the Secretary of Homeland Security.<br/>
3. Designation of military installations as national emergency centers<br/>
(a) In general<br/>
Not later than 60 days after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Secretary of Defense, shall designate not fewer than 6 military installations as sites for the establishment of national emergency centers….</p>
<p>I especially note this line:  <em>“…to meet other appropriate needs, as determined by the Secretary of Homeland Security”.</em> That would, of course, be the same Homeland Security which advises “law enforcement” to keep an eye on returning war Veterans and anyone who dares to support Ron Paul or Chuck Baldwin, or who believes in the Constitution as written, as we saw in part one of this series. Here is another approach, this time from the President of the United States of America.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>NATIONAL SECURITY PRESIDENTIAL DIRECTIVE/NSPD 51</strong><br/>
<strong> HOMELAND SECURITY PRESIDENTIAL DIRECTIVE/HSPD-20</strong><br/>
Subject: National Continuity Policy<br/>
Purpose<br/>
(1) This directive establishes a comprehensive national policy on the continuity of Federal Government structures and operations and a single National Continuity Coordinator responsible for coordinating the development and implementation of Federal continuity policies. This policy establishes “National Essential Functions,” prescribes continuity requirements for all executive departments and agencies, and provides guidance for State, local, territorial, and tribal governments, and private sector organizations in order to ensure a comprehensive and integrated national continuity program that will enhance the credibility of our national security posture and enable a more rapid and effective response to and recovery from a national emergency.<br/>
.</p>
<p> Did we notice how they slipped in that little bit about “<em>private sector organizations</em>“? We’ll get to that below, but first, here is that same President being cheered by the mindless masses while promising to convert, er, make that read “change”, America into a veritable military-police state in the event of an “<em>emergency</em>“.</p>

<p>When one removes the Govlish spin on the silliness of such official proclamations one can see a grotesque portrait of what JADE HELM 2015 is really all about.  And the more closely one looks into it, the more one realizes that JADE HELM 2015 is but a symptom, a sign of something much larger, much more potent, much more sinister. The military will be infiltrating American communities and properties while also working with “law enforcement” at Local, State, and regional levels. Unconventional Warfare psy-warriors will be collecting data of the sort which our Intelligence community has long called “HUMINT” (HUMan INTelligence). That data will be “mapped” as features of the “Human Terrain” for the States where the exercise will occur. That HUMINT will be pooled up somewhere in impersonal indifferent soul-less computing machines which have absolutely no regard for any citizen’s individuality or unalienable rights.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Canadian firm D-Wave Systems unveiled and demonstrated today what it calls “the world’s first commercially viable quantum computer.” Company officials announced the technology at the Computer History Museum in Mountain View, California in a demonstration intended to show how the machine can run commercial applications and is better suited to the types of problems that have stymied conventional (digital) computers…</em><br/>
<em>Quantum computers rely on quantum mechanics, the rules that underlie the behavior of all matter and energy, to accelerate computation. It has been known for some time that once some simple features of quantum mechanics are harnessed, machines will be built capable of outperforming any conceivable conventional supercomputer. </em></p>

<p><strong><em> Excerpt:</em> </strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><em> Google’s announcement last week that it plans to launch a new quantum computing laboratory with NASA may have boosted a highly specialized and slightly obscure field of study into a more mainstream light. The search-engine giant says quantum technology will help the company build better, more accurate search engines, and will help advance the field of artificial intelligence.</em></p>
<p>If it strikes one odd that a private corporation and our government would join forces on a technology which will expand the surveillance state’s appetite, one would not be alone. A term I published in 1999 comes to mind as a good descriptive: “The Corporate Dynasty”. <em><br/>

<p>In June, 2013, almost every American (and most other people of the world) took pause in daily routines to register the shock of learning that one’s every communication has been being collected by massive super-computers. As anyone might have let the implicating gravity of that register more deeply into one’s awareness, one likely found oneself reflecting about to whom one may have sent an email or made a phone call. Imagine one’s instant fear – “Oh my! What if *<em>they</em>* listened to<em> that call</em>, or read <em>that email</em>!”</p>
<p>And who would “they” be? PRISM, of course.</p>

<p><strong>In that article Clapper promises:</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><em>The government “does not unilaterally obtain information from the servers of U.S. electronic communication service providers,” Clapper added. “The notion that Section 702 activities are not subject to internal and external oversight is similarly incorrect. Collection of intelligence information under Section 702 is subject to an extensive oversight regime, incorporating reviews by the Executive, Legislative and Judicial branches.”</em></p>
<p><em> </em>And of course we are to be reassured by the fact that a Congress which enjoys a ten percent approval rating is certainly keeping our best interests in mind, right?</p>
<p>JADE HELM 2015 is an Unconventional Warfare exercise, and we saw in parts one and two that UW psy-warriors use “surrogates” of the criminal type for black operations. Surrogates are criminals who can be “handled” or “directed” by psy-warriors doing Unconventional Warfare/Irregular Warfare/Special Operations deployments anywhere in the world, including the USofA. The Army’s 2008 manual on UW actually identifies “terrorists” as a likely sort of “surrogate”. Here is that bit from the Army’s 2008 manual on Unconventional Warfare, from part two of this series:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><em><strong>(“Irregulars” who are to be used as surrogates) “…are</strong></em><br/>
<em><strong>usually nonstate-sponsored and unconstrained by sovereign nation legalities and</strong></em><br/>
<em><strong>boundaries. These forces may include, but are not limited to, specific paramilitary</strong></em><br/>
<em><strong>forces, contractors, individuals, businesses, foreign political organizations, resistance</strong></em><br/>
<em><strong>or insurgent organizations, expatriates, transnational terrorism adversaries,</strong></em><br/>
<em><strong>disillusioned transnational terrorism members, black marketers, and other social or</strong></em><br/>
<em><strong>political ‘undesirables.'”</strong></em></p>
<p>My point is, what on earth makes anyone believe that the government can “oversee” what the government does in secrecy? Clapper was hiding behind his statement that all three branches of government exercise <em>oversight</em> of the NSA’s illegal and unlawful spying on American citizens. The problem is that damn near everyone we send to WDC gets corrupted in their first breath of air there, and we really cannot trust anything any of them say, most certainly now that we know that those doing the <em>oversight</em> prior to the Snowden leaks never bothered to mention to We The People what our damned government was doing to us until well <em>after</em> Snowden exposed their sins.</p>
<p>Here is James Clapper lying to Congress about just what the NSA was collecting from the American people:</p>

<p>The insanity which was spawned by the creation of the National Security State has deluded two generations of American legislators into fabulous stretches of imagination which causes our Congress to continue to lie to the American people about everything from the Federal Reserve System, Inc., to the creation of the so-called “War on Terrorism”, and just about everything in between.  That insanity was created in part by Allen Dulles, working with Clark Clifford to produce the National Security Act of 1947 which created the National Security Council at the White House (where Oliver North worked). It also created a cute little diddy referred to as the “Black Budget” for covert, illegal, and immoral activities to be conducted by the NSA-1947’s chief creation – the CIA. But we must keep in mind that there is more than one “black budget”. There is the secret black budget which Congress appropriates to be used for black operations, but there is also the cash flow — in terms of outright “cash” — which is accumulated tangentially as the CIA shares services with terrorists, drug smugglers, insurgents, human traffickers, money launderers, etc.</p>
<p>Those who believe that “US Code” is somehow superior to the Constitution itself actually <em>believe</em> that the National Security Act of 1947 literally gave the American government the “<em>legal right</em>” to lie to We The People. It’s been all downhill ever since. The lying needs to stop.</p>
<p>JADE HELM 2015 is yet another lie, but a pregnant one which will give birth to yet more lies.  We The People are yet expected to believe anything our dear government tells us about JADE HELM 2015. But consider — the ARSOF public info officer filmed speaking to Texas audiences about JADE HELM 2015 coming to their areas this summer had no problem telling Texans that some JADE HELM 2015 warriors would be in civilian clothing, remember? Those “warriors” will include many people who are not in the military at all, but are employees of corporations which do contract work with the Federal government. What those in plain clothes will be doing is what this part of this series is about.</p>
<p>Let me repeat the point which I (hopefully) made in part one of this series — We cannot believe there is a War on Terrorism when our own government proves to be the source which has literally created and armed “the terrorists”. We cannot believe there is a War on Drugs when our own government coordinates production and transportation internationally of the bulk of all illegal drugs. We cannot believe that the U.S. military has somehow found Constitutional authorization to practice Unconventional Warfare tactics on U.S. soil outside the military bases the tax paying public has provided for such things. The standing army could not even exist without some concocted “enemy”, and has no Constitutional grounds to be conducting exercises which admittedly include Psychological Operations and exercises which are designed to facilitate “mapping the human terrain” for purposes of “Mastering The Human Domain”.  No Sir! This is insanity, this is immoral, this is criminal, this is evil, this is unacceptable, and this must be stopped now. Why we must stop it will become apparent as one continues to read below.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>Intelligence Incorporated</strong></em></h2>
<p>JADE HELM 2015 is a remarkable gambit in public relations as well as a public confession that our government in Washington D.C. (WDC) has completely divested itself from any accountability to the American people and our Constitution.  The military has boldly announced that JADE HELM 2015 is an “Unconventional Warfare” exercise, which means that it will be operating on multiple levels including PSYOP tactics which will assist computerized think tanks in WDC in “Mastering” the “Human Domain”. I’m not making that up, for as we saw in part one of this series ARSOF itself announces it boldly.</p>
<p>To master the human domain one must first map the human terrain, and that is another aspect of JADE HELM 2015 which will be exercised during operations across America this summer.  The Army concedes that it has interest now in “Civil Affairs”, as we noted in previous installments of this series. We also noted that the Army / Pentagon has several actualized Fusion Center relationships with our local police, with interfaces between FEMA, the Department of Justice (DOJ), and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).  Additionally we have noted that various “new” concepts have pervaded Pentagon doctrine in the past two-to-three decades, and such concepts include “drug interdiction”, “peace keeping”, and “counter-terrorism” activities right here on U.S. soil under an umbrella announced in the early 1990s and called reverently “Operations Other Than War” (OOTW).

<p>With that much established in the first three parts of this series, I am going to now suggest that the U.S. military has aligned itself in a relationship with an odd and grotesque mental appendage to the body politic, that being the <em>insane notion</em> now embraced by our General government in WDC which compels government to protect itself from the will of We The People, at all costs. This wild and unfounded, even indefensible notion crept into the mechanized mindset of our government after the world entered the post-Atomic age in which planners were confronted by challenges posed by the threat of “decapitation” of our government in WDC by a nuclear attack. The Great Cold War of the latter half of the Twentieth Century began with, as Professor Carroll Quigley stated, “<em>…the quest for the thermo-nuclear bomb</em>.” [My paraphrase] The post-Cold War quest for global power by the military-industrial complex brought with it the newly-born Intelligence community mentality which holds like a religion the premise that “<em>The End Justifies The Means</em>“. In the eyes of those who work in government, Gov is tantamount to God. The mindset is what I’ve always alluded to as “<a href="https://eliasalias.com/2011/10/11/govlish-an-exercise-in-deciphering/" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'https://eliasalias.com/2011/10/11/govlish-an-exercise-in-deciphering/', 'Govlish');" target="_blank"><em><strong>Govlish</strong></em></a>“. Outsourcing government business to private sector corporations who sell products in service to Wall Street and WDC as well as to the Pentagon made by people who are not in government offices is a very huge business. To verify that we’ll look briefly at a wonderful resource compiled by The Washington Post several years ago.</p>

<p>Today’s Federal government, when judged by its actions and results, seems to suffer from a conceit which it believes whole-heartedly. I fully-well understand that no man-made government can be a “mind” or a “soul”, because being created by the mind of man its entity-ship is limited to the indifferent status of merely being a “legal fiction”, no matter how universally it might spread its powers. Therefore, when I speak of the government as if it has a mind capable of willing its own direction or pursuing its own conceits, I am simply speaking through <em>personification</em>, a poetic tool of figurative language. The General government in WDC is not “conceited”, but its style of administering itself unto and upon We The People causes we flesh-and-blood real humans to question whether its madness is intended or merely coincidental. It is in that light that I note that the government seems to be suffering from a conceit, and that it seems to believe its own conceit whole-heartedly. That conceited belief, were it real and of any substance, would be the mistaken belief that our government is itself “America”.</p>
<p>Our government is <em>not</em> America, period. Not only is it not America — our government lately does not appear to even represent the will of We The People who <em>are</em> America.</p>
<p>America is this great land and the people who live and work upon it, period.  We and our good neighbors who live and work out our lives on the soil delineated by State lines and National borders, we and our lands, are America. The government we installed to service the mutual needs of the citizens of the several States was created to be a tool guided by the hand of We The People. It was never intended to usurp our individual sovereignty, tromp upon our autonomy, or assault our “unalienable rights”. As Thoreau put it,</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>I heartily accept the motto, “That government is best which governs least”; and I should like to see it acted up to more rapidly and systematically. Carried out, it finally amounts to this, which also I believe — “That government is best which governs not at all”; and when men are prepared for it, that will be the kind of government which they will have. Government is at best but an expedient; but most governments are usually, and all governments are sometimes, inexpedient. The objections which have been brought against a standing army, and they are many and weighty, and deserve to prevail, may also at last be brought against a standing government. The standing army is only an arm of the standing government. The government itself, which is only the mode which the people have chosen to execute their will, is equally liable to be abused and perverted before the people can act through it…  This American government — what is it but a tradition, though a recent one, endeavoring to transmit itself unimpaired to posterity, but each instant losing some of its integrity? It has not the vitality and force of a single living man; for a single man can bend it to his will…  Yet this government never of itself furthered any enterprise, but by the alacrity with which it got out of its way. It does not keep the country free. It does not settle the West. It does not educate. The character inherent in the American people has done all that has been accomplished; and it would have done somewhat more, if the government had not sometimes got in its way. </em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>— From “<a href="../index.html?p=3242" target="_blank"><em>Essay On The Duty of Civil Disobedience</em></a>” by Henry David Thoreau</strong></p>
<p> My point is that the government is not “America”, but is a system created by Americans to serve certain limited and enumerated  purposes as laid out in plain English in Article 1, Section 8 of the Constitution which created it. Yet today’s General government in WDC appears through its fanfare of actions as an out-of-control behemoth which has matched its arrogance with an unlimited vanity, purporting to now own the States which created it, and asserting its will to control the several States and their respective citizens via departments and offices not granted in its Constitution. Examples include, but are not limited to, the BLM, the Department of Education, the DOJ’s sub-groups such as the ATF and DEA, the IRS, FEMA and the Department of Homeland Security. None of those are authorized by the Constitution which created the Federal government, which is why a couple of Presidents of late have noted that the Constitution is just a <em>“(expletive) piece of paper”. </em>It actually gets in the government’s way, as we’ll see in an excerpt from Christopher Ketchum’s article about Main Core, below.</p>
<p>It is extremely important that all Americans remember two primary facts of reality: First, we must never forget that <em>the government</em> is *not* “America”. It is a creation by Americans for Americans. “We The People” are America, and we have every right to manage how our popularly-created government administers itself upon us. Secondly, all Americans need to take a look at the original Constitution, including the signatories at bottom of that document, where we notice that there is no signature by anyone representing the Federal government. No one signed the Constitution on behalf of the Federal government, because it did not exist until <em>after</em> the several States ratified the document. This is a clear message — the States, in compact, created the Federal government. The fact that the Federal government now administers itself upon our backs as if it created the States and has some right to control We The People is a government-sponsored delusion, an illusion, a great lie to which almost all politicians in WDC have succumbed.</p>
<p>Please bear those two facts in mind as we look into COG and Main Core and their relationship to JADE HELM 2015.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;"> <strong>MAIN CORE</strong></h2>
<p> </p>
<p>Let us now borrow from Christopher Ketcham, whose article I’ve mirrored &lt; <a href="../index.html?p=5755" target="_blank"><em><strong>here</strong></em></a> &gt; (Recommend reading the whole article.)</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>In the spring of 2007, a retired senior official in the U.S. Justice Department sat before Congress and told a story so odd and ominous, it could have sprung from the pages of a pulp political thriller. It was about a principled bureaucrat struggling to protect his country from a highly classified program with sinister implications. Rife with high drama, it included a car chase through the streets of Washington, D.C., and a tense meeting at the White House, where the president’s henchmen made the bureaucrat so nervous that he demanded a neutral witness be present.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>The bureaucrat was James Comey, John Ashcroft’s second-in-command at the Department of Justice during Bush’s first term. Comey had been a loyal political foot soldier of the Republican Party for many years. Yet in his testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, he described how he had grown increasingly uneasy reviewing the Bush administration’s various domestic surveillance and spying programs. Much of his testimony centered on an operation so clandestine he wasn’t allowed to name it or even describe what it did. He did say, however, that he and Ashcroft had discussed the program in March 2004, trying to decide whether it was legal under federal statutes. Shortly before the certification deadline, Ashcroft fell ill with pancreatitis, making Comey acting attorney general, and Comey opted not to certify the program. When he communicated his decision to the White House, Bush’s men told him, in so many words, to take his concerns and stuff them in an undisclosed location.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Comey refused to knuckle under, and the dispute came to a head on the cold night of March 10, 2004, hours before the program’s authorization was to expire. At the time, Ashcroft was in intensive care at George Washington Hospital following emergency surgery. Apparently, at the behest of President Bush himself, the White House tried, in Comey’s words, “to take advantage of a very sick man,” sending Chief of Staff Andrew Card and then-White House counsel Alberto Gonzales on a mission to Ashcroft’s sickroom to persuade the heavily doped attorney general to override his deputy. Apprised of their mission, Comey, accompanied by a full security detail, jumped in his car, raced through the streets of the capital, lights blazing, and “literally ran” up the hospital stairs to beat them there.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Minutes later, Gonzales and Card arrived with an envelope filled with the requisite forms. Ashcroft, even in his stupor, did not fall for their heavy-handed ploy. “I’m not the attorney general,” Ashcroft told Bush’s men. “There”—he pointed weakly to Comey—”is the attorney general.” Gonzales and Card were furious, departing without even acknowledging Comey’s presence in the room. The following day, the classified domestic spying program that Comey found so disturbing went forward at the demand of the White House—”without a signature from the Department of Justice attesting as to its legality,” he testified….</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Addressing the nation from the Oval Office in 2005 after the first disclosures of the NSA’s warrantless electronic surveillance became public, Bush insisted that the spying program in question was reviewed “every 45 days” as part of planning to assess threats to “the continuity of our government.”</em></p>
<p> How awesome, eh? Fedgov may violate our First Amendment and Fourth Amendment rights so long as it reviews its violations periodically, yes? And if the Department of Justice refuses to condone it, Fedgov will just do it anyway, because the American people are too busy with their comfortable lives to rise up in rebellion. Fedgov sees our apathy as license to carry on with its nefarious assault.</p>
<p>Continuity of Government (COG) has been a priority for the General government since the nuclear arms race began back in the 1940s and 1950s, but was ramped up strongly under the Reagan administration in the early 1980s.  It’s existence as a governmental priority came to light dramatically when Texas Representative Jack Brooks questioned Oliver North during the Iran-Contra-Mena scandal hearings in Congress. Though it is now common knowledge, I note the irony in which a government which steadfastly seeks to keep its most sensitive operations secret from the American people also simultaneously seeks to know everything to the smallest detail about every citizen’s life and activities.The government has learned that we humans are “sentient beings” and wants to get to know us better, yes? After all, our feelings and emotions and intuitions and inspirations and all the moods and related states of mind are elements of the “Human Terrain”.</p>
<p>What is “sentience”? A friend once noted to me that cats and dogs are “sentient” beings, meaning that they have emotions. Cats and dogs can show their love for their owners, can express joy and fear, have likes and dislikes, can dream during sleep, can learn, and they have many other attributes matching those of we humans. Simply put, “sentience” is the registration in the brain of emotions in response to specific subjective life-experience environments. So, given the Govlish madness which now engulfs our government, it is not surprising that government wants to turn its quantum computing powers onto the soul of man.</p>

<p>(Subscribing to <a href="https://www.corbettreport.com/" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'https://www.corbettreport.com/', 'The Corbett Report');" target="_blank"><strong>The Corbett Report</strong></a> is highly recommended.)</p>
<p><strong>In June, 2013,</strong> almost every American (and most other people of the world) took pause in daily routines to register the shock of learning that one’s every communication has been being collected by impersonal and indifferent machines called computers. As anyone might have let that register more deeply into one’s awareness, one likely found oneself reflecting about to whom one may have sent an email or made a phone call. Imagine one’s instant fear – “Oh my! What if *they* listened to that call, or read that email!”</p>
<p>Some say – “When spying is done without warrants, concern is warranted.” The only thing warranted in all this warrantless spying on the American people is concern.  “Concern” is your and my “warrant”. The fact that the NSA is doing this to the American people is remarkable. Regarding such activity being conducted outside the U.S. A., I’m not sure of course, but I imagine that the average Brit or Spaniard or Italian or German or anyone in any other country, especially political/governmental officials, might also resent this kind of global snooping. Let us remember, this spying by NSA is a world-wide human info trap.</p>
<p>The NSA has been doing this for a long time, for the most part in secrecy. We may recall the national outrage when ECHELON surfaced years ago, and we lamented that the Bush 43 administration enabled the NSA to monitor our communications and that the companies which worked with the Bush administration to spy on Americans’ communications received government pardons. Here is a bit of the chronology surrounding the ECHELON scandal – remember Russ Tice? Quoting him:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">“As a Signals Intelligence (SIGINT) officer it is continually drilled into us that the very first law chiseled in the SIGINT equivalent of the Ten Commandments (USSID-18) is that Thou shall not spy on American persons without a court order from FISA. This law is continually drilled into each NSA intelligence officer throughout his or her career. The very people that lead the National Security Agency have violated this holy edict of SIGINT.”</p>
<p>From Wikipedia we read:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><em><strong>On December 23, 2005, the Austin American-Statesman reported Tice’s allegations that spying on Americans may involve a massive computer system known as ECHELON, which is able to search and filter hundreds of thousands of phone calls and e-mails in a matter of seconds.</strong></em></p>
<p>Please note that the NSA’s ECHELON program was scanning emails and phone calls for key words which would red-flag each message for further analysis. A further statement from Russ Tice in June 2013:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><em><strong>On June 19, 2013, Tice claimed while being interviewed that the NSA had spied on Barack Obama himself while he was still a senator, along with monitoring federal judges, ranking military officials, and other members of congress, saying he himself had seen and held papers ordering such actions. He went on to say, “This thing is incredible what NSA has done. They’ve basically turned themselves – in my opinion – into a rogue agency that has J. Edgar Hoover capabilities on a monstrous scale on steroids.”</strong></em></p>
<p>Still, in 2005 and 2006, the public in general – the group mind of the nation – was not cognizant of anything other than a few fleeting, bland and breezy news articles which were quickly buried under a sports story or Hollywood star news flash.  Rush Limbaugh and Bill O’Reilly even condemned Russ Tice for exposing NSA criminality, as if to expose wrong-doing was wrong. I suppose they had bought the Govlish line about some emergency and some “War on Terror”, yes?</p>
<p>But now, suddenly, because Mr. Snowden allegedly provided two newspapers with the actual paperwork which proves our deepest fears, everyone knows the NSA has been dragging in all of our communications and storing them for future reference. The NSA is screaming that they were not “reading” our mails or “listening” to our conversations on the phone – oh no; they are just “collecting” them for future reference. The NSA sees nothing wrong, immoral, or illegal about collecting your and my communications without asking permission or without getting a warrant based on probable cause.  The NSA has no problem with keeping that kind of criminality ‘secret’ from “we, the targets”. My question on that count is if the NSA will knowingly violate my Fourth Amendment right to be secure in my individual life as an American citizen, why should I believe them about anything else they may proclaim? The NSA is publicly denying that they are reading our communications, yet we’ve got the proof that they were doing that as far back in time as 2005, eight years ago.</p>
<p>Not long ago a General was running things at NSA. His name is Michael Hayden. From NSA he went on to become head of CIA, preceding General Petreus, who resigned in disgrace the day after President Obama’s second election. Hayden was caught on film at the Press Club trying to tell a group of journalists that the phrase “probable cause” was not in the Fourth Amendment. See for yourself –</p>
<div class="video-container">
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="615" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cGhcECnWRGM?rel=0" width="820"></iframe>
</div>
<p>This man had the gall to literally deny, at the Press Club no less, that “probable cause” is in the Fourth Amendment. What should we think of that? And he was head of NSA, and then became head of CIA? My God!</p>
<p>And there is this from 2007: <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2007/06/23/sentient_worlds/" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.theregister.co.uk/2007/06/23/sentient_worlds/', 'http://www.theregister.co.uk/2007/06/23/sentient_worlds/');" target="_blank"><strong>http://www.theregister.co.uk/2007/06/23/sentient_worlds/</strong></a></p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Sentient world: war games on the grandest scale</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>by Sim Strife * 23 Jun 2007</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><em>The DOD is developing a parallel to Planet Earth, with billions of individual “nodes” to reflect every man, woman, and child this side of the dividing line between reality and AR.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><em>Called the Sentient World Simulation (SWS), it will be a “synthetic mirror of the real world with automated continuous calibration with respect to current real-world information”, according to a concept paper for the project.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><em>“SWS provides an environment for testing Psychological Operations (PSYOP),” the paper reads, so that military leaders can “develop and test multiple courses of action to anticipate and shape behaviors of adversaries, neutrals, and partners”.</em></p>
<p> This is getting to be quite interesting. They will want my drivers license, military service records, shopping/consumer habits, criminal record or lack thereof, medical records, reading habits, entertainment preferences, driving habits and locations driven to, acquaintances and family members, social security records, tax compliance records, political party affiliations, clubs and organizations such as VFW or VVA etc., visits to the Dentist, whether or not I have a television, cell phone, computer, etc etc etc. Everything. And all of that info will be assembled into the nature of my “node” in a quantum computer that is “mapping the human terrain”. I will be reduced to HUMINT particles in a machine which couldn’t care less about my “rights”, other than to map into my node what I think those rights are .</p>
<p>Thanks to the way Snowden and other whistle-blowers did their handiwork, it’s all over the news and can’t be stuffed back into the bag. So in honor of Snowden’s heroics let’s plug James Bamford with a friendly Salute!</p>
<p>James Bamford is the author who brought to light the now-infamous “Northwoods Document”. He is also a favorite author, having written the definitive tome on the NSA – <strong>Body Of Secrets </strong>– and the more-recent “<strong>The Shadow Factory</strong>”. Bamford is also the guy who fingered the NSA’s massive <strong><em>Data Center in Utah</em></strong>, which is another centerpiece in this collage. Now James Bamford has a new article published over at WIRED. It will not offend if you take pause here and go to <a href="http://www.wired.com/2013/06/general-keith-alexander-cyberwar/" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.wired.com/2013/06/general-keith-alexander-cyberwar/', 'WIRED');" target="_blank"><em><strong>WIRED</strong></em></a>’s site and read Mr. Bamford’s masterpiece.</p>
<p>I’ll get you started with these few lines from the beginning of the piece:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Quoting –<em> Inside Fort Meade, Maryland, a top-secret city bustles. Tens of thousands of people move through more than 50 buildings—the city has its own post office, fire department, and police force. But as if designed by Kafka, it sits among a forest of trees, surrounded by electrified fences and heavily armed guards, protected by antitank barriers, monitored by sensitive motion detectors, and watched by rotating cameras. To block any telltale electromagnetic signals from escaping, the inner walls of the buildings are wrapped in protective copper shielding and the one-way windows are embedded with a fine copper mesh.</em></strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong><em>This is the undisputed domain of General Keith Alexander, a man few even in Washington would likely recognize. Never before has anyone in America’s intelligence sphere come close to his degree of power, the number of people under his command, the expanse of his rule, the length of his reign, or the depth of his secrecy. A four-star Army general, his authority extends across three domains: He is director of the world’s largest intelligence service, the National Security Agency; chief of the Central Security Service; and commander of the US Cyber Command. As such, he has his own secret military, presiding over the Navy’s 10th Fleet, the 24th Air Force, and the Second Army.</em></strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong><em>Alexander runs the nation’s cyberwar efforts, an empire he has built over the past eight years by insisting that the US’s inherent vulnerability to digital attacks requires him to amass more and more authority over the data zipping around the globe. In his telling, the threat is so mind-bogglingly huge that the nation has little option but to eventually put the entire civilian Internet under his protection, requiring tweets and emails to pass through his filters, and putting the kill switch under the government’s forefinger. “What we see is an increasing level of activity on the networks,” he said at a recent security conference in Canada. “I am concerned that this is going to break a threshold where the private sector can no longer handle it and the government is going to have to step in.”</em></strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>End Quoting. </strong></p>
<p>The NSA wants to be able to “data-mine” every American’s phone calls and emails and lots of other personal stuff such as medical records, military service records, consumer records, credit ratings, book purchases, ATM withdrawals and banking records, criminal records, financial portfolios, groups or organizations to which one makes donations or contributions, vacation destinations,  education records, employment records, air, ship, or train transportation records – in a word, everything about us. The NSA wants to data-mine all that for up to five years back into the past. In other words, what you said on the phone five years ago could be mined by NSA today. Like, as in, <em>everything</em> you have said online or on the phone for the past five years. Especially,  ” the program utilizes software that makes predictive judgments of targets’ behavior and tracks their circle of associations with “social network analysis” and artificial intelligence modeling tools. “The more data you have on a particular target, the better [the software] can predict what the target will do, where the target will go, who it will turn to for help…”</p>
<p>Read that for yourself in Ketchum’s lengthy article,  here –  <a href="http://www.christopherketcham.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/The%20Last%20Roundup,%20Radar%20Magazine.pdf" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'download', 'http://www.christopherketcham.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/The%20Last%20Roundup,%20Radar%20Magazine.pdf');" target="_blank"><strong>http://www.christopherketcham.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/The%20Last%20Roundup,%20Radar%20Magazine.pdf</strong></a></p>
<p>They are doing this on each and every one of us.  All the time. And not only did they not ask our permission, they tried to keep it secret from us.  It’s done in the name of “<em>National Security</em>“, and all that jazz. Now they’re trying to sell the American people on the sham story that it’s somehow “legal”.</p>
<p>It is unlawful for the General government to surveil American citizens without a warrant issued upon probable cause.  The “legal” framework, including whichever Executive Orders or National Emergency Orders or Presidential Decision Directives or whichever other concoction “legal teams” working for the General government come up with, is null and void on its face as soon as it tampers with the Constitution. The reason? It contradicts and violates the highest uncontested law of the land (the Common Law), and the great law from which all subsequent laws <em>must</em> derive their legitimacy – the U.S. Constitution. And of course, that is why we Constitutionalists are in the government’s cross-hairs.</p>
<p>This impersonal spying has got a lot of folks upset, with good reason. It is rude, offensive, and very un-American.  Worse, it is un-necessary and is part of a concocted fraud, a man-made “myth”. The fraudulent myth is the alleged “War on Terror”. To perpetuate that lie, government has shifted the original intent for Cold War “Continuity of Government” (COG) operations into a mindset which sees dissenting Americans as the newest “enemy”.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>“COG”</strong></h2>
<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;embedded link for COG: <a href="http://www.archives.gov/federal-register/codification/executive-order/12656.html" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.archives.gov/federal-register/codification/executive-order/12656.html', 'http://www.archives.gov/federal-register/codification/executive-order/12656.html');" target="_blank"><em><strong>http://www.archives.gov/federal-register/codification/executive-order/12656.html</strong></em></a></p>
<p>From that link —</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><strong>Part 1–Preamble</strong></em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><strong>Section 101. National Security Emergency Preparedness Policy.</strong></em><br/>
<em><strong> (a) The policy of the United States is to have sufficient capabilities at all levels of government to meet essential defense and civilian needs during any national security emergency. A national security emergency is any occurrence, including natural disaster, military attack, technological emergency, or other emergency, that seriously degrades or seriously threatens the national security of the United States. Policy for national security emergency preparedness shall be established by the President. Pursuant to the President’s direction, the National Security Council shall be responsible for developing and administering such policy. All national security emergency preparedness activities shall be consistent with the Constitution and laws of the United States and with preservation of the constitutional government of the United States.</strong></em></p>
<p>COG is “Continuity of Government”.  The first time, to my knowledge, that COG surfaced to the attention of the American public was during the U.S. Senate hearings on the Iran-Contra-Mena scandal in the 1980s. In those hearings Texas Representative Jack Brooks queried Colonel Oliver North as to his relationship with Continuity of Government.  The shadowy secret powers shut that question down quite smartly, then and there. Watch:</p>

</div>
<p>Brooks was on to something big.  Let’s ask this sensitive question — If Congress has a ten percent approval rating and if the government is hell-bent on disarming Americans; if our economy and financial system is shaky at best; if DHS thinks too many Americans are “radicalized” or “extreme” in their beliefs; if government is over-hauling our social and cultural matrix the way Patrick Wood reveals it is doing in his book, Technocracy Rising; if special interests in the military-industrial complex are seeking ever-tightening controls over public perception; if Americans everywhere are figuting out that this government is creating “enemies” to keep this country and our lifestyles viable; if Americans in mass were to rise up to correct the problems in WDC — would this government seek to protect itself from the wrath of the People themselves at all costs? I think we all know the answer, but in case there are any who still doubt the obvious, let’s now accelerate this article by introducing three links which are “musts” for every Oath Keeper, every human being, every patriot, every American, indeed, every human on earth.</p>
<p>The first is as important as John B. Wells’ interview with Patrick Wood on the Caravan To Midnight show. Mr. Wells’ guest is anonymous, but this is one show everyone interested in JADE HELM 2015 positively and absolutely must view, several times again and again. Do take notes on your second time through this show. Given all I have packed into this series of articles, we should now be ready to see clearly what the special guest on this show is giving to America —</p>

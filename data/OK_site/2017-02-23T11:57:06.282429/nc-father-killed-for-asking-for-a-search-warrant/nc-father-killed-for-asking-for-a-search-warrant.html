<p>In yet another tragic citizen shooting by police. This time a father was beat, tazed, maced and ultimately shot several times..for what crime you ask? For merely refusing to allow a deputy into his residence at 3:40 in the morning without a proper search warrant. Do our constitutional rights already mean nothing? It is beyond time to start holding these rouge officers responsible for their actions. In this and so many more just this month those actions look to be murder (at times even executions.) It is time for us to start demanding that the Sheriffs and Police Chiefs rein in their lose cannons and train them in Constitutional Rights, de-escalation and proper use of force. I will soon be posting a series of articles and interviews on this topic.</p>
<p>Here is the story according to <a href="http://wncn.com/2015/11/15/1-killed-in-harnett-co-officer-involved-shooting/" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://wncn.com/2015/11/15/1-killed-in-harnett-co-officer-involved-shooting/', 'WNCN');">WNCN</a>:</p>
<p>SPRING LAKE, N.C. (WNCN) – A dad was shot several times and died in an officer-involved shooting in Spring Lake Sunday morning, witnesses said.</p>

<p>The incident occurred just before 3:40 a.m. at a residence near the intersection of Stage Road and W. Everett Drive when deputies arrived on scene to conduct an assault investigation, the Harnett County Sheriff’s Office said.</p>

<p>According to authorities, “a confrontation with an individual resulted in a shooting.” The person involved in the confrontation was pronounced dead at the scene, while the deputy received minor injuries.</p>
<p>Clayton Carroll told WNCN that his roommate, 33-year-old John Livingston was shot several times by a Harnett County Sheriff deputy during the incident.</p>
<p>Carroll says sheriff’s deputies knocked on their door around 3:30 a.m.</p>
<p>Carroll said they were looking for someone that no longer lived there. When deputies asked Livingston if they could search the trailer, Livingston said “not without a search warrant,” according to Carroll.</p>
<p>Livingston then closed the door.</p>

<p>“The cop kicked in the door, got on top of him, started slinging him around beat him…” Carroll said.</p>
<p>Carroll said sheriff’s deputies then started spraying mace on Livingston and using the Taser, according to the roommate.</p>
<p>Witnesses said Livingston was not fighting back and was trying to get the Taser out of the deputy’s hands.</p>

<p>The incident eventually continued outside.</p>
<p>“He (Livingston) barely had the Taser in his hand but he had it where it was constantly going off and the officer I guess  that spoke to him rolled over there, says he got the Taser and shot him in this position,” Carroll said while on the deck outside the home demonstrating what happened.</p>
<p>WNCN saw six bullet holes in the side of the home from the shooting.</p>

<p>Carroll said Livingston was shot six times, while another witness in the home, Bristol Edge, said Livingston was shot at least four times.</p>
<p>Livingston died a short time later. Carroll said Livingston did not have a weapon.</p>
<p>Livingston’s friends call him a very kind man and an incredible carpenter, they say he built the front porch deck a month ago for everyone to have a good time on.</p>
<p>The father of three is described as a hard worker and very loving.</p>
<p>“That’s the blanket I kept putting on him and telling him to breathe until he was gone because I knew he wasn’t breathing anymore,” said Bristol Edge, a friend, pointing to a blanket still on the blood-stained front porch on Sunday afternoon.</p>
<p>As per standard procedure, the deputies involved have been placed on administrative leave and the North Carolina State Bureau of Investigation is investigating the shooting.</p>
<p>Authorities have not released the identity of the deputies involved.<br/>

Stewart Rhodes: [00:00:15] Our message to the military frankly is we never want to see ever see in my entire life, I never want to see veterans fighting against active duty or the police and military. That's the most vile and seen thing I could ever imagine. So my message to them is that if - we hope it never comes, But if ever such a day comes, Please fulfill your oath. Stand down and then sit back open a can of beer and watch the show because the American people are more than sufficient to correct and defend their liberty. If such a day ever comes. more than sufficient. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:01:01] And that's one more thing I want to address. There have been some critics who are supposedly on our side who say what you said what you won't do but what will you do. When are you going to march on Congress and stop Congress from VAX or allowing vaccinations of children. One guy wanted a military coup to stop vaccinations. What you the military go order Congress to do X Y and Z, you know protect our borders whatever it is. Is it the responsibility is it the lawful power of the military to direct Congress to do anything. Who is the boss of Congress, the military or the people. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:01:35] Now whose fault is it if Congress is gone all gone awry and gone off the reservation. It's our fault. Who was supposed to remedy that. What's the responsibility of the military in defending the Constitution, is to resist to do, to refuse unlawful orders to not be a tool of oppression. Do they have an authority to go beyond that and to take control of the government. No. as the Declaration says. Whenever any government becomes abusive of these ends - which are what life, liberty, pursuit of happiness. That's the whole point of government. when the government becomes abusive of these ends it is the right of who the military? No, it's the right of the people to abolish it to institute such new government as they think necessary or reform it. It's the people's obligation. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:02:31] When you look at the structure of our Constitution is very clear. what institution is necessary for security of a free State? the militia that's in the Second Amendment. What institution does Congress have the authority to provide for the calling force to repel invasions and suppress insurrections? It's the militia. What did the founders see as the check, a final check upon an abuse of government. The people as a militia. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:03:10] Now is that some kind of Radical right wing philosophy. Or did the Supreme Court say in Heller. They pointed out although I don't really care for much of the Heller decision it's a little bit too watered down. They did point out that this was the purpose, duh. The purpose of the militia is to provide the force that will secure liberty as the final recourse. The answer that, the founders answer to the ancient question of who shall guard the guardians is that the people shall guard themselves. It's a problem throughout history. Who shall guard the guardians. You erect regular army but who who prevents you from having a Caesar cross the Rubicon. How do you stop that. What do you do. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:03:54] You make the people the guardians of themselves. We used to be like that the founders envision strong militias in every state. That was the force that was responsible always for repelling invasions and suppressing insurrections not the standing army. They were suspicious of standing armies. They had seen history. They knew their history. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:04:18] So it was to be the people themselves to this. Up till now you still have in Switzerland still a decent citizen militia although there has been deteriorate also. Switzerland's gone through a couple of hundred years with only a citizen's militia. You don't need a huge standing army. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:04:35] We have one now. We have a huge military establishment as a result of the cold war largely, And now with the modern war on terror. That's a bit of a distortion. What's happened to our militia. Where are they. well being being diminished you have the National Guard, That's supposed to be the militia. But where are they? There most of most were overseas. They've become basically a part of the reserves and sent abroad. So now we have some state defense forces we'll talk to that later. But they're really pretty small. In fact a few of them just been disarmed. The Mississippi State Defense Force is not allowed to train with firearms. What kind of a defense force is that. Even the Boy Scouts go out and shoot 22 times. So they've been I guess emaciated is one possible term but look women can be militia members too. The point is the founders intended that the people to be your own guardians you have let their responsibilities slide. It's your fault. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:05:38] You also let slide all the other barriers and restraints, fiscal barriers, monetary barriers, monetary restraints. all of these things you've let slide. And so now we find ourselves quite frankly on the verge of an economic collapse. You don't think so you're been paying attention. So whether it happens or not the point is is we've let our responsibilities slide it's our own fault. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:06:07] So if the day should come when God forbid there should be some potential dictator the United States, it is not the mission of responsibility or the legal obligation of the military to correct that. It's the responsibility of the people. Now our goal though is to make that day never come. We. And we look to the future. I don't care how long it takes. I don't care if it never happens, I hope it never happens. but the point is we're not saying it's happening right this second. We're saying that. These institutions, these barriers, these restraints have been torn asunder. What is left to us. What is left to us is imperfect. I would prefer that all the politicians and judges and lawyers kept their oath. I could just resign and dissolve Oath Keepers. In fact I can just quit being a lawyer. I can go back to being a sculptor. I'd rather do that for a living. Frankly it's much more fun. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:07:03] But I became a lawyer and I established this organization for the purpose of doing my part because I see these institutions have been eroded. So this is a stopgap. We do want the military police to keep their oath. We'd like them all to keep their oaths. But the focus on the military and police is precisely because we see the dishonor and the deviousness among politicians and judges who would violate their oaths and we want to make sure that if they willfully violate their oaths, it won't be the end of our republic. Plain and simple. OK. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:07:38] Whenever that comes to that day comes we want to be a thing where they go look we can't do it. All these people are saying that are going to keep their oaths and I don't care if they become official number of members of Oath Keepers or not. I could care less. Just keep your oath if you keep your oath or an Oath Keeper. From the very beginning we even said we're not going to have official membership. We really did that because some guys were like hey I want something I want a card that's in my pocket like a card carrying ACLU member. I want a certificate on my wall. So I want something to show it's not enough for me. When are you going to get a real organization and I can join in, let me know, that's what they said. So that's why we did that. Well you don't have to join. I'm not asking everyone to become to join my army or something. Just keep your oath. It is not to the ten orders you will not obey, that's a teaching tool. That's the goal for example that we think if we disagree fine. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:08:27] Just be sincere in your defense. Know the Constitution, first bedrock. They have the stones, the courage, the integrity to do what you have to do to to to abide by your oath to defend it and then have the the personal integrity and honesty in dealing with each other and everybody else. OK. That's what's so lacking. Right now we have such honesty such a lack of goodwill in this country and the people that are doing that are playing with fire. They don't understand what they're really doing. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:09:00] It is not free. You don't get to destroy goodwill, destroy open honest discussions and communications without cost. If you polarize this nation through lies, through smear, through innuendo, and label half the country racists and terrorists you will reap the whirlwind. We will all reap the whirlwind. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:09:24] It's time to set aside such nonsense, such injustice and dishonesty and speak openly with goodwill. That's why I encourage all of you. It's your conduct that's going to matter. Like Washington said on the eve of the battle of long island. That's the quote we use he said. The future of this nation where the Americans will be free whether their children will be free depends upon the conduct of this army. That's what he said. Well for all of us all the American people whether our children will be free depends upon our conduct. Not just the capacity of Oath Keepers or police or military or whether we are, as Americans. It's our responsibility. So that's why in this organization the bedrock is good will, its integrity, its honesty and its civility and we insist upon it.

<div>City sued after 2-year-old burned in ‘no-knock’ raid<span>.</span></div>
<div><span>
<div>
<p>A 2-year-old California boy was burned  and traumatized by a police smoke bomb in a botched “no-knock” raid at  the wrong home, his family claims in a lawsuit.</p>
<div></div>
<p>The boy’s parents, Jose and Paulina Salinas of Ventura County, sued  the City of Oxnard and its Police Department in Superior Court on  Monday, <a href="http://www.courthousenews.com/2014/11/19/cops-bombed-the-wrong-guys-family-says.htm" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.courthousenews.com/2014/11/19/cops-bombed-the-wrong-guys-family-says.htm', 'according to Courthouse News Service');" target="_blank">according to Courthouse News Service</a>.</p>
<p>The Salinas family seeks damages for assault, battery, trespass,  false imprisonment and infliction of emotional distress from the botched  raid. The raid occurred at 4 a.m. on April 16 while the family was  sleeping.</p>
<p>Jason Benites, assistant chief with the Oxnard Police Department, refused to comment on pending litigation.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.oxnardpd.org/pressreleases/2294/" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'https://www.oxnardpd.org/pressreleases/2294/', 'A police press release');" target="_blank">A police press release</a> from April briefly mentioned that a 2-year-old boy had “sustained minor  injuries” in the operation but did not say how the injuries occurred or  that the child had been burned by a police smoke bomb. Police threw a  smoke bomb into his bedroom during a “multi-location search warrant  operation” by several agencies targeting suspected gang members. The  agencies involved included local police, the district attorney’s office  and the Federal Bureau of Investigation with the stated goal of reducing  “gun violence” in Oxnard “through education, intervention, and  enforcement,” according to the news release.</p>
<p>The case is similar to an incident that occurred in Habersham County,  Georgia, on May 28 when a 19-month-old boy was severely burned in a  botched no-knock raid on his family’s house. In that case, sheriffs  deputies threw a flash-bang grenade into little Bou Bou Phonesavanh’s  crib, blowing off his nose and burning his face and chest, which has  required him to undergo more than $1 million worth of surgeries and  treatment. Habersham County has to date refused to pay for the toddler’s  medical expenses. Like in the California case, the Georgia deputies  found no drugs or guns in the house. They arrested the targeted suspect  hours later at another house for possession of a small amount of  methamphetamine.</p>
<p><span></span></p>
<div>
<p>A grand jury deliberated over the case as presented by the district attorney but, <a href="http://www.wnd.com/2014/10/no-charges-in-sloppy-swat-raid-that-maimed-baby/" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.wnd.com/2014/10/no-charges-in-sloppy-swat-raid-that-maimed-baby/', 'as WND reported on Oct. 6');" target="_blank">as WND reported on Oct. 6</a>,  decided not to indict the Habersham Sheriff’s Office on any criminal  charges. Habersham County Sheriff Joey Terrell previously told WND that  the grenade tossing was a mistake. The deputy who threw the grenade has  since resigned from the department.</p>
<p>In the wake of the “Bou Bou” case, State Sen. Vincent Fort, D-Ga., has been trying to <a href="http://www.wnd.com/2014/07/burned-toddler-spotlights-spike-in-swat-raids/" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.wnd.com/2014/07/burned-toddler-spotlights-spike-in-swat-raids/', 'reform Georgia’s laws to rein in the use of “no-knock” warrants');" target="_blank">reform Georgia’s laws to rein in the use of “no-knock” warrants</a>.  A pregnant Clayton County woman was injured during a 2010 SWAT raid in  Georgia and 92-year-old Kathryn Johnson was shot and killed in Atlanta,  eight years ago today on Nov. 21, 2006, when a SWAT team burst into her  home in a botched no-knock raid in which they had targeted the wrong  home.</p>
<p>“Civil rights groups have chronicled dozens of other such cases in recent years where SWAT-type police with an overzealous mindset have mistakenly injured or killed  innocent Americans – mistakes that are most often chalked up as little  more than oops,’ absent any repercussions to the offending officers,”  wrote crime journalist Cheryl Chumley in a recent column for WND.</p>

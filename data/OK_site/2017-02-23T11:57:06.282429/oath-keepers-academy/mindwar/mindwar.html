<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>The book</strong> “MindWar” was published in 2013 by one of the Psy-warrior officers from the U.S. Army’s 7th Psychological Warfare Group who with a fellow psy-warrior came up with, in 1980, the name of a new concept in psychological operations. The book author is Michael A. Aquino. In his mind, MindWar is a tactic in psychological warfare to be employed and exploited by the U.S. military world-wide for all-out control of the mental states and perceptions of all populations. No, I’m not making this up — you can read a <a href="https://www.google.com/?gws_rd=ssl#q=mindwar%2C+aquino" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'https://www.google.com/?gws_rd=ssl#q=mindwar%2C+aquino', 'document');" target="_blank">document</a> produced within the 7th Psy-Op Group of the U.S. Army in 1980, co-authored by Dr. Aquino, author of that book pictured above. The name of his document, which has been preserved online thanks to Dr. Aquino, is: “From PSYOP To MindWar”. This is an Army document from a Psy-Op group in the U.S. military about thirty-five years ago.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">MindWar is real, and it has developed, grown, and spread like a virus in the channels and compartmentalized mechanisms and infrastructures of various agencies and departments of the U.S. government, spreading into everyone’s life now.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Can I back-up such a statement? Yes.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">This section of the Oath Keepers Academy will deal with MindWar — what it is, how it is conducted, and what it means for every American. I will be adding posts here often. To begin,  here is the text of “From PSYOP To MindWar” by then Colonel Paul E. Vallely and then-Major Michael Aquino.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Introduction</strong><br/>
– by Michael A. Aquino<br/>
Lt. Colonel, Military Intelligence, USAR-Ret<br/>
November 2003</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">In the later 1970s, Psychological Operations (PSYOP) doctrine in the U.S. Army had<br/>
yet to emerge from the disappointment and frustration of the Vietnam War. Thus it was<br/>
that in 1980 Colonel Paul Vallely1 , Commander of the 7th PSYOP Group, asked me, as<br/>
his Headquarters PSYOP Research &amp; Analysis (FA) Team Leader, to draft a paper that<br/>
would encourage some futurethought within the PSYOP community. He did not want a<br/>
Vietnam postmortem, but rather some fresh and innovative ideas concerning PSYOP’s<br/>
evolution and application.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I prepared an initial draft, which Colonel Vallely reviewed and annotated, which<br/>
resulted in revised drafts and critiques until he was satisfied, and the result of that was this<br/>
paper: From PSYOP to MindWar: The Psychology of Victory.2</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Colonel Vallely sent copies of it to various governmental offices, agencies, commands,<br/>
and publications involved or interested in PSYOP. He intended it not as an article for<br/>
publication, but simply as a “talking paper” to stimulate dialogue. In this it was quite<br/>
successful, judging by the extensive and lively letters he received concerning it over the<br/>
next several months.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">That should have been the end of MindWar: a minor “staff study” which had done<br/>
its modest job.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">With the arising of the Internet in the 1980s, however, MindWar received an entirely<br/>
unexpected – and somewhat comic – resurrection. Allusions to it gradually proliferated,<br/>
with its “sinister” title quickly winning it the most lurid, conspiracy-theory reputation. The<br/>
rumor mill soon had it transformed into an Orwellian blueprint for Manchurian Candidate<br/>
mind control and world domination. My own image as an occult personality added fuel to<br/>
the wildfire: MindWar was now touted by the lunatic fringe as conclusive proof that the<br/>
Pentagon was awash in Black Magic and Devil-worship.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Now that this absurdly comic opera has at least somewhat subsided, I thought that it<br/>
might be interesting to make a complete and accurate copy of the paper available, together<br/>
with an Introduction and some historical-hindsight annotations to place it in reasonable<br/>
context. After all it did – and perhaps still does – have something worthwhile to say.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Within the U.S. military, PSYOP has habitually been relegated to a back-seat as a<br/>
“force multiplier”. The principal strategic decisions are made in consideration of traditional<br/>
political and military interests and goals. Only then is PSYOP invited to the table, to help<br/>
achieve already-agreed-upon missions more efficiently.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">MindWar reverses this sequence. Psychological means for achieving victory –<br/>
essentially through convincing the enemy that he really wants to bring his national policies<br/>
into harmony with ours – are fashioned in support of basic political goals. The use of<br/>
“ordinary” military force (bombs, bullets, etc.) is regarded as a “last resort” in<br/>
circumstances wherein MindWar by itself fails.</p>
<p style="text-align: left; padding-left: 30px;">1 Later Major General, USAR.<br/>
2 The term “MindWar” was coined by another PSYOP officer, Colonel Richard Sutter, and myself in 1977. After seeing the<br/>
recent film Star Wars, we played with a modification of its name as a futuristic replacement for the somewhat bland Army<br/>
designation “Psychological Operations”. An avowedly science-fictional treatment of MindWar, complete with a caricature of<br/>
Sutter at its helm, appears in my Star Wars story The Dark Side, available at www.xeper.org/maquino</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">– 2 –</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The advantage of MindWar is that it conducts wars in nonlethal, noninjurious, and<br/>
nondestructive ways. Essentially you overwhelm your enemy with argument. You seize<br/>
control of all of the means by which his government and populace process information to<br/>
make up their minds, and you adjust it so that those minds are made up as you desire.<br/>
Everyone is happy, no one gets hurt or killed, and nothing is destroyed.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Ordinary warfare, on the other hand, is characterized by its lack of reason. The<br/>
antagonists just maim or kill each other’s people, and steal or destroy each other’s land,<br/>
until one side is hurt so badly that it gives up [or both sides are hurt so badly that they<br/>
agree to stop short of victory]. After such a war there is lasting misery, hate, and suffering.<br/>
The only loser in MindWar are the war profiteers: companies and corporations which<br/>
grow fat on orders for helicopters, tanks, guns, munitions, etc. Consequently what<br/>
President Dwight Eisenhower referred to as the “military/industrial complex” can be<br/>
counted upon to resist implementation of MindWar as the governing strategic conflict<br/>
doctrine.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">That’s the MindWar prospectus in its most simplified form.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">While in the 1980s I had no reason to think that this paper had had any official effect<br/>
upon U.S. PSYOP doctrine within or beyond the Army, it was with some fascination that I<br/>
saw specific of its prescriptions applied during the first Gulf War, and recently even more<br/>
obviously during the 2003 invasion of Iraq. In both instances extreme PSYOP was<br/>
directed both against the object of the attack and upon U.S. domestic public perception<br/>
and opinion, in 2003 to the extent of “embedding” journalists with military units to<br/>
inevitably channel their perspectives and perceptions.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The impact of even these minor techniques of MindWar was remarkable. A<br/>
psychological climate of inexorable U.S. victory was created and sustained in both the<br/>
United States and Iraq, which accelerated that victory on the ground.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Somewhat less positively, the failure of MindWar in this instance to be guided by only<br/>
the most rigorous principles of truth and ethics has just as inexorably led to a substantial<br/>
post-victory evaporation of that euphoric climate. Therein lies the Achilles’ heel of<br/>
MindWar. Invoking as it does the most intense emotions and commitments of its<br/>
audiences, it must deliver the goods as they are judged by the target audiences. If the<br/>
ethical values of those audiences are not respected – if MindWar is used only in the service<br/>
of ulterior motives and objectives – the resulting “disintoxication”can be socially shattering.<br/>
In 1987 I wrote a more extensive research paper for the National Defense University<br/>
concerning the ethics of PSYOP. Particularly if MindWar is actually to be employed as a<br/>
feature of U.S. foreign policy, I cannot stress too strongly the need for its subordination to<br/>
the strictest and most enlightened principles of humanity as discussed in that paper.<br/>

<p style="text-align: left;">Now let’s take a look at the 1980 MindWar paper itself. In addition to its original<br/>
footnotes (which generally identify quote-sources), I have added a few new ones to<br/>
highlight/critique some of its themes. These new footnotes are identified by “[MA2003]”<br/>
at their beginning.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">-3-</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"></h2>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">From PSYOP to MindWar: The Psychology of Victory</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">LTC John Alexander’s Military Review article in support of “psychotronics” –<br/>
intelligence and operational employment of ESP – was decidedly provocative.3 Criticism of<br/>
research in this area, based as it is on existing frontiers of scientific law, brings to mind the<br/>
laughter that greeted the Italian scientist Spallanzani in 1794 when he suggested that bats<br/>
navigate in the dark means of what we now call sonar. “If they see with their ears, then do<br/>
they hear with their eyes?” went the joke, but I suspect that the U.S. Navy is glad<br/>
someone took the idea seriously enough to pursue it.4</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Psychotronic research is in its infancy, but the U.S. Army already possesses an<br/>
operational weapons systems designed to do what LTC Alexander would like ESP to do –<br/>
except that this weapons system uses existing communications media. It seeks to map the<br/>
minds of neutral and enemy individuals and then to change them in accordance with U.S.<br/>
national interests. It does this on a wide scale, embracing military units, regions, nations,<br/>
and blocs. In its present form it is called Psychological Operations (PSYOP).</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Does PSYOP work, or is it a merely a cosmetic with which field commanders would<br/>
rather not be bothered?</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Had the question been asked in 1970, the answer would have been that PSYOP<br/>
works very well indeed. In 1967 and 1968 alone, a total of 29,276 armed Viet Cong/NVA<br/>
(the equivalent of 95 enemy infantry battalions) surrendered to ARVN or MACV forces<br/>
under the Chieu Hoi amnesty program – the major PSYOP effort in the Vietnam War. At<br/>
the time MACV estimated that the elimination of that same number of troops in combat<br/>
would of cost us 6,000 dead.5</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">On the other hand, we lost the war – not because we were out-fought, but because we<br/>
were out-PSYOPed. Our national will to victory was attacked more effectively than we<br/>
attacked that of the North Vietnamese and Viet Cong, and perception of this fact<br/>
encouraged the enemy to hang on until the United States finally broke and ran for home.<br/>
So our PSYOP failed. It failed not because its principles were unsound, but rather<br/>
because it was outmatched by the PSYOP of the enemy. The Army’s efforts enjoyed<br/>
some impressive successes, but our own PSYOP did not really change the minds of the<br/>
enemy populace, nor did it defend the U.S. populace at home against the propaganda of<br/>
the enemy. Furthermore the enemy’s PSYOP was so strong that it – not bigger armies or<br/>
better weapons – overcame all of the Cobras and Spookys and ACAVs and B52s we<br/>
fielded. The lesson is not to ignore our own PSYOP capability, but rather to change it and<br/>
strengthen it so that it can do precisely that kind of thing to our enemy in the next war.<br/>
Better hardware is nice, but by itself it will change nothing if we do not win the war for<br/>
the mind.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The first thing it is necessary to overcome is a view of PSYOP that limits it to routine,<br/>
predictable, over-obvious, and hence marginally effective “leaflet and loudspeaker”<br/>
applications. Battlefield devices of this sort have their place, but it should be that of a<br/>
accessory to the main effort. That main effort cannot begin at the company or division<br/>
level; it must originate at the national level. It must strengthen our national will to victory</p>
<p style="text-align: left; padding-left: 30px;"><em>3 Alexander, Lieutenant Colonel John B., “The New Mental Battlefield: Beam me up, Spock” in Military</em><br/>
<em>Review, Vol LX, No. 12 December 1980.</em><br/>
<em>4 [MA2003] Alexander (later Colonel) was involved with “parapsychological” ideas and experiments such</em><br/>
<em>as ESP and “remote viewing”. These have no connection whatever with either traditional PSYOP or</em><br/>
<em>MindWar. Cf. my paper Project Star Gate: $20 Million up in Smoke [and Mirrors] at</em><br/>

<p style="text-align: left;">– 4 –</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">and it must attack and ultimately destroy that of our enemy. It both causes and is affected<br/>
by physical combat, but it is a type of war which is fought on a far more subtle basis as<br/>
well – in the minds of the national populations involved.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">So let us begin with a simple name change. We shall rid ourselves of the selfconscious,<br/>
almost “embarrassed” concept of “psychological operations”. In its place we<br/>
shall create MindWar. The term is harsh and fear-inspiring, and so it should be: It is a<br/>
term of attack and victory – not one of the rationalization and coaxing and conciliation.<br/>
The enemy may be offended by it; that is quite all right as long as he is defeated by it. A<br/>
definition is offered:</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">MindWar is the deliberate, aggressive convincing of all participants in a war that we will win that war.<br/>
It is deliberate in that it is planned, systematic, and comprehensive effort involving all<br/>
levels of activity from the strategic to the tactical. It is aggressive because opinions and<br/>
attitudes must be actively changed from those antagonistic to us to those supportive of us<br/>
if we are to achieve victory. We will not win if we content ourselves with countering<br/>
opinions and attitudes instilled by enemy governments. We must reach the people before<br/>
they resolve to support their armies, and we must reach those armies before our combat<br/>
troops ever see them on battlefields.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Compare this definition with that of psychological warfare as first offered by General<br/>
William Donovan of the OSS in his World War II-era “Basic Estimate of Psychological<br/>
Warfare”:</p>
<p style="text-align: left; padding-left: 30px;">Psychological warfare is the coordination and use of all means, including moral and<br/>
physical, by which the end is attained – other than those of recognized military operations, but<br/>
including the psychological exploitation of the result of those recognized military actions –<br/>
which tend to destroy the will of the enemy to achieve victory and to damage his political or<br/>
economic capacity to do so; which tend to deprive the enemy of the support, assistance, or<br/>
sympathy of his allies or associates or of neutrals, or to prevent his acquisition of such support,<br/>
assistance, or sympathy; or which tend to create, maintain, or increase the will to victory of our<br/>
own people and allies and to acquire, maintain, or to increase the support, assistance, and<br/>
sympathy of neutrals.6</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">If the euphemism “psychological operations” resulted from, as one general officer put<br/>
it in a 1917 letter, “a great need for a synonym which would be used in peacetime that<br/>
would not shock the sensibilities of a citizen of democracy”, then it may have succeeded<br/>
domestically.7 On the other hand it does not seem to have reassured the sensibilities of the<br/>
Soviets, who in 1980 described the U.S. Army PSYOP as including:</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">… unpardonable methods of ideological sabotage including not just blackmail, provocation, and<br/>
terror.8</p>

<em>46-47.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">– 5 –</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The reluctance with which the Army has accepted even an “antiseptic” PSYOP<br/>
component is well-documented in Colonel Alfred Paddock’s brilliant treatise on the history<br/>
of PSYOP establishment. Again and again efforts to forge this weapon into its most<br/>
effective configuration were frustrated by leaders who could not or should not see that<br/>
wars are fought and won or lost not on battlefields but in the minds of men. As Colonel<br/>
Paddock so aptly concludes:</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">In a real sense, the manner in which psychological and unconventional warfare evolved from<br/>
1941 until their union as a formal Army capability in 1952 suggests a theme that runs<br/>
throughout the history of special warfare: the story of a hesitant and reluctant Army attempting<br/>
to cope with concepts and organizations of an unconventional nature.9</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">According to the present doctrine, PSYOP is considered an accessory to the main<br/>
effort of winning battles and wars; the term usually used is “force multiplier”. It is<br/>
certainly not considered a precondition to command decisions. Thus PSYOP cannot<br/>
predetermine the political or psychological effectiveness of a given military action. It can<br/>
only be used to point that action in the best possible colors as it is taken.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">MindWar cannot be so relegated. It is, in fact, the strategy to which tactical warfare<br/>
must conform if it is to achieve maximum effectiveness. The MindWar scenario must be<br/>
preeminent in the mind of the commander and must be the principal factor in his every<br/>
field decision. Otherwise he sacrifices measures which actually contribute to winning the<br/>
war to measures of immediate, tangible satisfaction. [Consider the rational for “body<br/>
counts” in Vietnam.]
</p><p style="text-align: left;">Accordingly PSYOP “combat support” units as we now know them must become a<br/>
thing of the past. MindWar teams must offer technical expertise to the commander from<br/>
the onset of the planning process, and at all levels down to that of the battalion. Such<br/>
teams cannot be composed – as they are now – of branch-immaterial officers and NCOs<br/>
who know simply the basics of tactical propaganda operations. They must be composed of<br/>
full-time experts who strive to translate the strategy of national MindWar into tactical goals<br/>
maximize the effective winning of the war and minimize loss of life. Such MindWar teams<br/>
will win commanders respect only if they can deliver on their promises.10</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">What the Army now considers to be the most effective PSYOP – tactical PSYOP – is<br/>
actually the most limited and primitive effort, due to the difficulties of formulating and<br/>
delivering messages under battlefield constraints. Such efforts must continue, but they are<br/>
properly seen as reinforcement of the main MindWar effort. If we do not attack the<br/>
enemy’s will until he reaches the battlefield, his nation will have strengthened it as best it<br/>
can. We must attack that will before it is thus locked in place. We must instill in it a<br/>
predisposition to inevitable defeat.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Strategic MindWar must begin the moment war is considered to be inevitable. It must<br/>
seek out the attention of the enemy nation through every available medium, and it must<br/>
strike at the nation’s potential soldiers before they put on their uniforms. It is in their<br/>
homes and their communities that they are most vulnerable to MindWar. Was the United<br/>
States defeated in the jungles of Vietnam, or was it defeated in the streets of American<br/>
cities?</p>
<p style="text-align: left; padding-left: 30px;"><em>9 Paddock, op. cit., page 258.</em><br/>
<em>10 [MA2003] In 1980 neither PSYOP nor Special Forces were career branches in the Army. Rather they</em><br/>
<em>were “branch-immaterial”, meaning that assignments to them were relatively brief and at the long-term risk</em><br/>
<em>of promotion within one’s basic branch. Later SF would become both an officer and an enlisted branch,</em><br/>
<em>and PSYOP would gain an enlisted branch, but PSYOP does not yet have an officer career branch.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">– 6 –</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">To this end MindWar must be strategic in emphasis, with tactical applications playing<br/>
a reinforcing, supplementary role. In its strategic context, MindWar must reach out to<br/>
friends, enemies, and neutrals alike across the globe – neither through primitive<br/>
“battlefield” leaflets and loudspeakers of PSYOP nor through the weak, imprecise, and<br/>
narrow effort of psychotronics11 – but through the media possessed by the United States<br/>
which have the capabilities to reach virtually all people on the face of the Earth.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">These media are, of course, the electronic media – television and radio. State of the<br/>
art developments in satellite communication, video recording techniques, and laser and<br/>
optical transmission of broadcasts make possible a penetration of the minds of the world<br/>
such as would have been inconceivable just a few years ago. Like the sword Excalibur, we<br/>
have but to reach out and seize this tool; and it can transform the world for us if we have<br/>
the courage and the integrity to enhance civilization with it. If we do not accept Excalibur,<br/>
then we relinquish our ability to inspire foreign cultures with our morality. If they then<br/>
desire moralities unsatisfactory to us, we have no choice but to fight them on a more<br/>
brutish level.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">MindWar must target all participants if it is to be effective. It must not only weaken<br/>
the enemy; it must strengthen the United States. It strengthens the United States by<br/>
denying enemy propaganda access to our people, and by explaining and emphasizing to<br/>
our people the rationale for our national interest in a specific war.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Under existing United States law, PSYOP units may not target American citizens.12<br/>
That prohibition is based upon the presumption that “propaganda” is necessarily a lie or at<br/>
least a misleading half-truth, and that the government has no right to lie to the people. The<br/>
Propaganda Ministry of Goebbels must not be a part of the American way of life.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Quite right, and so it must be axiomatic of MindWar that it always speaks the truth.<br/>
Its power lies in its ability to focus recipients’ attention on the truth of the future as well<br/>
as that of the present. MindWar thus involves the stated promise of the truth that the<br/>
United States has resolved to make real if it is not already so.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">MindWar is not new. Nations’ greatest – and least costly – victories have resulted from<br/>
it, both in time of actual combat and in time of threatened combat. Consider the atomic<br/>
attacks on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The physical destruction of those two cities did not<br/>
destroy Japan’s ability to continue fighting. Rather the psychological shock of the weapons<br/>
destroyed what remained of Japan’s national will to fight. Surrender followed; a long and<br/>
costly ground invasion was averted.13</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">MindWar’s effectiveness is a function of its own skillful use of communications media,<br/>
but no greater error could be made than to confuse MindWar with merely a greater and<br/>
more unprincipled propaganda effort. “Propaganda” as defined by Harold Lasswell, is:</p>
<p style="text-align: left; padding-left: 30px;"><em>11 [MA2003] “Psychotronics” was a term applied to concepts such as ESP and “remote viewing” by</em><br/>
<em>some government agencies in the 1970s-80s, possibly to make them sound more “scientific”.</em><br/>
<em>12 [MA2003] This law was established after World War II, purportedly both out of distaste for the extreme</em><br/>
<em>domestic propaganda of the fascist powers and because of misgivings about American domestic</em><br/>
<em>propaganda, particularly during World War I. At the time of this paper (1980), the law was so strict that, for</em><br/>
<em>example, printing presses of Army PSYOP units were prohibited from being used to run off posters for</em><br/>
<em>local military recruiting stations.</em><br/>
<em>13 [MA2003] Nevertheless Hiroshima and Nagasaki are not very good examples of MindWar, because –</em><br/>
<em>despite their psychological impact – they involved the killing and injuring of a great many people. MindWar</em><br/>
<em>is perfect when no one is physically harmed.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">– 7 –</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">… the expression of opinions or actions carried out deliberately by individuals or groups with a<br/>
view to influence the opinions or actions of other individuals or groups for predetermined ends<br/>
and through psychological manipulations.14</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Propaganda, when it is recognized as such – and anything produced by a “PSYOP”<br/>
unit is so recognized – is automatically assumed to be a lie or at least a distortion of the<br/>
truth. Therefore it works only to the extent that a militarily-pressed enemy is willing to do<br/>
what we want him to. It does not work because we have convinced him to see the truth as<br/>
we see it.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">If his “Conclusions” chapter to the Army’s exhaustive 1976 case-study of PSYOP<br/>
techniques, L. John Martin affirms this coldly and bluntly:</p>
<p style="text-align: left; padding-left: 30px;">What this all boils down to is that if our persuasive communication ends up with a near<br/>
positive effect, we must attribute it to luck, not science… The effectiveness of propaganda may<br/>
be even less predictable and controllable than the effectiveness of mere persuasive<br/>
communication.15</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Correspondingly propagandists are assumed to be liars and hypocrites, willing to paint<br/>
anything attractive colors to dupe the gullible. As Jacques Ellul puts it:</p>
<p style="text-align: left; padding-left: 30px;">The propagandist is not, and cannot be, a “believer”. Moreover he cannot believe in the<br/>
ideology he must use in his propaganda. He is merely a man at the service of a party, a state, or<br/>
some other organization, and his task is to insure the efficiency of that organization … If the<br/>
propagandist has any political conviction he must put it aside in order to be able to use some<br/>
popular mass ideology. He cannot even share that ideology, for he must use it as an object and<br/>
manipulate it without the respect that he would have for it if he believed in it. He quickly<br/>
acquires contempt for these popular images and beliefs…16</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Unlike PSYOP, MindWar has nothing to do with deception or even with “selected” –<br/>
and therefore misleading – truth. Rather it states a whole truth that, if it does not now<br/>
exist, will be forced into existence by the will of the United States. The examples of<br/>
Kennedy’s ultimatum to Khrushchev during the Cuban Missile Crisis and Hitler’s stance at<br/>
Munich might be cited.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">A MindWar message does not have to fit conditions of abstract credibility as do<br/>
PSYOP themes; its source makes it credible. As Livy once said:</p>
<p style="text-align: left; padding-left: 30px;">The terror of the Roman name will be such that the world shall know that, once a Roman<br/>
army has laid siege to a city, nothing will move it – not the rigors or winter nor the weariness of<br/>
months and years – that it knows no end but victory and is ready, if a swift and sudden stroke<br/>
will not serve, to preserve until that victory is achieved.17</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Unlike Ellul’s cynical propagandist, the MindWar operative must know that he speaks<br/>
the truth, and he must be personally committed to it. What he says is only a part of<br/>
MindWar; the rest – and the test of its effectiveness – lies in the conviction he projects to his</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">audience, in the rapport he establishes with it.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">And this is nothing that can be easily faked, if in fact it can be faked at all. “Rapport”,<br/>
which the Comprehensive Dictionary of Psychological and Psychoanalytical Terms<br/>
defines as “unconstrained relations of mutual confidence”, approaches the subliminal;<br/>
some researchers have suggested that it is itself a subconscious and even perhaps even<br/>
ESP-based “accent” to an overt exchange of information.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Why does one believe one television newsman more than another, even though both<br/>
may report the same headlines? The answer is that there is rapport in the former case;<br/>
and it is a rapport which has been recognized and cultivated by the most successful<br/>
broadcasters.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">We have covered the statement of inevitable truth and the conviction behind that<br/>
statement; these are qualities of the MindWar operative himself. The recipient of the<br/>
statement will judge such messages not only by his conscious understanding of them, but<br/>
also by the mental conditions under which he receives them. The theory behind<br/>
“brainwashing” was that physical torture and deprivation would weaken the mind’s<br/>
resistance to suggestion, and this was true to a point. But in the long run brainwashing<br/>
does not work, because intelligent minds later realize their suggestibility under such<br/>
conditions and therefore discount impressions and options inculcated accordingly.18<br/>
For the mind to believe in its own decisions, it must feel that it made those decisions<br/>
without coercion. Coercive measures used by the operative, consequently, must not be<br/>
detectable by ordinary means. There is no need to resort to mind-weakening drugs such as<br/>
those explored by the CIA; in fact the exposure of a single such method would do<br/>
unacceptable damage to MindWar’s reputation for truth.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Existing PSYOP identifies purely-sociological factors which suggest appropriate<br/>
idioms for messages. Doctrine in this area is highly developed, and the task is basically one<br/>
of assembling and maintaining individuals and teams with enough expertise and experience<br/>
to apply the doctrine effectively. This, however, is only the sociological dimension of target<br/>
receptiveness measures. There are some purely natural conditions under which minds may<br/>
become more or less receptive to ideas, and MindWar should take full advantage of such</p>
<p style="text-align: left; padding-left: 30px;"><em>18 Cf. John Marks, The Search for the “Manchurian Candidate”. New York: Times Books, 1979.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">– 9 –</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">phenomena as atmospheric electromagnetic activity19 , air ionization20 , and extremely low<br/>
frequency waves21 .</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">At the root of any decision to institute MindWar in the U.S. defense establishment is a<br/>
very simple question: Do we wish to win the next war in which we choose to become<br/>
involved, and do we wish to do so with minimum loss of human life, at minimum expense,<br/>
and in the least amount of time? If the answer is yes, then MindWar is a necessity. If we<br/>
wish to trade that kind of victory for more American lives, economic disaster, and<br/>
negotiated stalemates, then MindWar is inappropriate, and if used superficially will actually<br/>
contribute to our defeat.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">In MindWar there is no substitute for victory.22</p>
<p style="text-align: left; padding-left: 30px;"><em>19 Atmospheric electromagnetic (EM) activity: The Human body communicates internally by EM and</em><br/>
<em>electrochemical impulses. The EM field displayed in Kirlian photographs, the effectiveness of acupuncture,</em><br/>
<em>and the body’s physical responses to various types of EM radiation (X-rays, infrared radiation, visible light</em><br/>
<em>spectra, etc.) are all examples of human sensitivity to EM forces and fields. Atmospheric EM activity is</em><br/>
<em>regularly altered by such phenomena as sunspot eruptions and gravitational stresses which distort the</em><br/>
<em>Earth’s magnetic field. Under varying external EM conditions, humans are more or less disposed to the</em><br/>
<em>consideration of new ideas. MindWar should be timed accordingly. Per Dr. L.J. Ravitz:</em><br/>
<em>Electromagnetic field constructs add fuel to the assumption unifying living matter</em><br/>
<em>harmoniously with the operations of nature, the expression of an electromagnetic field no less</em><br/>
<em>than non-living systems; and that as points on spectrums, these two entities may at last take their</em><br/>
<em>positions in the organization of the universe in a way both explicable and rational … A tenable</em><br/>
<em>theory has been provided for emergence of the nervous system, developing not from functional</em><br/>
<em>demands, but instead deriving as a result of dynamic forces imposed on cell groups by the total</em><br/>
<em>field pattern. Living matter on has a definition of state based on relativity field physics, through</em><br/>
<em>which it has been possible to detect a measurable property of total state functions. (Ravitz, State-</em><br/>
<em>Function, Including Hypnotic States” in Journal of American Society of Psychosomatic</em><br/>
<em>Dentistry and Medicine, Vol. 17, No. 4, 1970.)</em><br/>
<em>20 Ionization of the air: An abundance of negative condensation nuclei (“air ions”) in ingested air</em><br/>
<em>enhances alertness and exhilaration, while an excess of positive ions enhances drowsiness and depression.</em><br/>
<em>Calculation of the ionic balance of a target audience’s atmospheric environment will be correspondingly</em><br/>
<em>useful. Again this is a naturally-occurring condition – caused by such varying agents as solar ultraviolet</em><br/>
<em>light, lightning, and rapidly-moving water – rather than one which most be artificially created. (Detonation</em><br/>
<em>of nuclear weapons, however, will alter atmospheric ionization levels.) Cf. Soyke, Fred and Edmonds, Alan,</em><br/>
<em>The Ion Effect. New York: E.P. Dutton, 1977.</em><br/>
<em>21 Extremely Low Frequency (ELF) waves: ELF waves up to 100 Hz are once more naturally occurring,</em><br/>
<em>but they can also be produced artificially (such as for the Navy’s Project Sanguine for submarine</em><br/>
<em>communication). ELF-waves are not normally noticed by the unaided senses, yet their resonant effect upon</em><br/>
<em>the human body has been connected to both physiological disorders and emotional distortion. Infrasound</em><br/>
<em>vibration (up to 20 Hz) can subliminally influence brain activity to align itself to delta, theta, alpha, or beta</em><br/>
<em>wave patterns, inclining an audience toward everything from alertness to passivity. Infrasound could be</em><br/>
<em>used tactically, as ELF-waves endure for great distances; and it could be used in conjunction with media</em><br/>
<em>broadcasts as well. See Playfair, Guy L. and Hill, Scott, The Cycles of Heaven. New York: St. Martin’s</em><br/>
<em>Press, 1978, pages 130-140.</em><br/>

<em>substitute for victory.”</em></p>

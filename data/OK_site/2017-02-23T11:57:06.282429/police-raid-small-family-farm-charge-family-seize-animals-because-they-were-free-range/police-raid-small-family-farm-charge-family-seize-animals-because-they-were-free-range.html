<p style="text-align: justify;">This is but another example of Big-AG, and their bought and paid for politicians and law enforcement, driving the little guy, who uses humane farming practices, out of business, thereby eliminating competition. (Not to mention healthier foods.)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">What happens when enough small farms are raided, such as the West Wind Acres farm, is that the State, and its power wielding enforcers, create more enemies. All the relatives and friends of the raided farms begin to look at the power structure in a new way. Those who buy healthy foods from these farms, likewise, begin to see it is all a massive power struggle. Eventually, the tide will turn, when enough small farmers have been raided, all to please Big-Ag.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">More and more people are turning away from Big-Ag products, looking for healthy, natural foods for their families. The tide IS changing. Politicians and law enforcement need to wake up.  – Shorty Dawkins, Associate Editor</p>

<p>By John Vibes on March 24, 2015</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Schenectady County, New York – Earlier this month, a family farm in rural New York was raided by police after the owners were cited on a number of trumped up regulatory violations. Joshua Rockwood, the owner of the farm, is being accused of mistreating his animals, and the local government has began confiscating some of them.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Police initially visited Rockwood’s property on February 25th to investigate reports of unlicensed working dogs, weeks before the raid. Unfortunately, Rockwood voluntarily showed local police around his property, which he had not yet tended to that day because of their unexpected interruption.  After showing them around, they began to critically assess every aspect of the farm, writing a number of citations for arbitrary offenses.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The very next day, Rockwood had a veterinarian visit the farm to check on the animals to confirm that they were well taken care of and in good health. According to numerous reports, the vet said that the animals were just fine, and did not seem to share the concerns that the officers alleged during their walk-through.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A second veterinarian was also called in to verify the health of the animals and they also found them to be in perfect health.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A week later, police returned again to notify Rockwood that he was to appear in court the next Thursday on a number of charges relating to the animal’s food and shelter. In total, 12 different charges were brought against Rockwood, but he has posted a number of photos to a Facebook support page, which shows the animals with sufficient housing, and plenty of food.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://www.oathkeepers.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/West-Wind-3.jpg"><img alt="West Wind 3" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5806" height="253" src="https://www.oathkeepers.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/West-Wind-3.jpg" width="450"/></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Rockwood has been charged with 12 counts of animal neglect and abuse – some of the charges relating to frozen water bowls and tanks – despite the animals still having access to water. His dogs and horses have been seized and taken away.</p>
<p>Rockwood treats his animals better than most factory farms do, but since he uses traditional farming methods, his farm will fail regulatory inspections, while factory farms will pass.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, New York is one of many states that are currently considering “ag-gag” laws, which place criminal penalties on activists who expose animal abuse at factory farms.</p>

## Stewart Rhodes

Stewart Rhodes: [00:00:05] It's kind of like this. Picture the werewolf. Remember the old movies about the werewolf with Lon Chaney. He's like you know. I'm going to turn when the moon gets full I'm gonna turn into a werewolf I'm gonna try to eat you. So please do me a favor and chain me to this bed or lock me in this room and don't let me out. OK. In advance he makes you no provisions for when the fact when the inevitable time comes when he turns into a werewolf and goes nuts. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:00:31] Well we're kind of the same way in times of emergency and fear, war, famine, disease, whatever it is. We tend to like what. As I just heard a little while ago that Barack Obama is now declared a national emergency because of a swine flu. Is that right. Is that right. No did it did it did he do that though. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:00:52] OK so whatever the man is whatever the fear is the whole point of our Constitution is that in times when we're not afraid we lay down the rules that are going to limit us when we will want to break those chains. Those are the chains again. like the Lon Cheney as the werewolf. We know the founders knew that in times of desperation people would seek to do whatever they thought was necessary, including rounding up citizens and of Japanese descent and turning them, including arresting newspaper editors and pamphleteers in the street, including rounding up American citizens and detaining without trial. They knew this would be done. Disarming people like was done in Katrina, blocking people in the city like was during Katrina and a lot of leave that across the bridge. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:01:44] Why. Because they were black. Is that why they did that. Who knows. Point is the make a difference whether they are white or black or whatever. There were U.S. citizens detained within a city not allowed to leave. They were U.S. citizens disarmed. House to house. By order of the Of the chief of police of the city of New Orleans. It's on our video. Yeah. Upon pain of death that threat of death. disarmed. is the bill of rights suspended by little bad weather. is it suspended by a flu pandemic. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:02:23] The Founders put those restraints in place precisely for times of emergency. The idea that when there's an emergency you can step away from the bounds of the Constitution and the Bill of Rights is ridiculous. It defeats the whole point. They're not written for the best of times. They're written for the worst of times. They're written for when we do like Lon Cheney and become a werewolf the moon of fear and war and disease comes full. We turn into the werewolf and desire to go loose and do whatever we think we have to do to satisfy our appetites for safety or appetites for vindictiveness against our political opponents. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:03:04] Don't you think they'd love to unleash the full power of government against us. I go on a bit on Daily Kos a few times poked around. They're calling for us to be investigated. You know they're going to you are going to go do their own snooping and peeking around trying to find something. To sic the DOJ on us and one guy said that's not enough for me I want him all dead. So he said about Oath keepers. I want them dead. And then earlier this year there was a poster on Daily Kos debating and discussing. You know I get guess some gun rights activists that hey you know you can watch out. Don't push too hard it could lead to a civil war. If you try to disarm us and this response this Daily Kos writer was ah you think you stand up to the US military when we shell your cities, when we call in air strikes on your homes and flatten your homes with your women and children inside. This guy said. you'll submit is what he said. And then someone said well wait a minute. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:04:00] You know if you do something like that the American people won't stand for it. He said hey when the media gets done with the smear campaign against these people they'll be clamoring for us to do it. Is what this guy said. So not only does this guy think the police and military are just mindless robots who kill their own citizens, will kill women and children, that's what they think of us I guess. But they also see the media as a compliant tool to do their bidding and help them smear to justify the flattening of our homes with our women and children inside. Now how is that. Is that hate speech. Don't you think. How come no one's no one's going around calling Daily Kos. I mean has anybody seen a counterpart to that on our site? and yet we're labeled, we're on the Hate Watch on Southern Poverty Law Center blog. We're all over the place in the news and being painted by by people who should know better, by fake journalists, fake bloggers, who are just all they are is just tools. and not they're not trying to be journalists, discover the truth. They're trying to smear and label for the purpose expressed by that Daily Kos writer, to smear us to the point where they can justify the unleashing of the full force of government against those they consider their enemies. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:05:19] The Founders put in place the chains of the Constitution precisely to prevent the majority or whoever happens to hold power from unleashing the full force of government against the minority whether they be white, black, or Japanese. The whole point is to restrain the passions that will come to the surface in times of emergency. I would have liked to have seen in the Japanese internment the US Army troops my branch. They were ordered to go and round up men, women, and children of Japanese descent and take them confined him in concentration camps. I would have liked to have seen some of them, At least one of them refuse. Now some will say I've even had some military people say, How dare you question my honor. I will keep my oath. and to them I say well look at that look at the internment Japanese-Americans. look at the disarm during Katrina. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:06:18] Yes there are men of honor women of honor integrity in the military services who will keep their oath. But we know that there are some who will not. Unfortunately. it is our goal it is our dream that if we reach out to all of them we can reach, teach, and inspire all of them to keep their oaths. My best outcome, if ever a day should come when any willful president or even a willful general who attempts to pull a coup, ever attempts to establish his or herself as a dictator in this country. It is my hope and our dream that all of the people with the guns, all the police, and all the military will refuse to comply and will stand down and tell the dictator to do it yourself. That's our mission here with the Oath Keepers is to make sure that we remind those in service about their obligations under that civic duty.

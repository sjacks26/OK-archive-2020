Title screen: Oath Keepers Muster Quartzsite, Arizona August 28, 2011

JP: I came out here from Indianapolis. I never pass up a chance to hang out with Ernest Hancock and Stewart Rhodes. Ernie and SR are big influences for me, they’re inspiring people. The work they do has a lot to do with the work I do. I try to spread the message of freedom and liberty. As Dr. Paul says, freedom is popular. It’s not a hard message to get behind.

## JP song plays while video cuts to other images. First, a big march led by an OK sign, OK flag, US flags, lots of Gadsden flags. There’s a big Ron Paul sign. There’s a guy in a Guido Fawkes mask. A long line of cars are driving slowly. The line of cars is much longer than the line of walkers. There’s a sign for a Phoenix area Tea Party group.

## This song is overtly Christian. It’s “The Pendulum,” I think. Song ends at 0:05:42.3

JJ: The brave men and women marching in this heat. You’re marching where cowards fear to tread. People who can vote in this town leave when it gets this hot. God bless you all for coming out to stand with the citizens of this town. Right is right, wrong is wrong. The rule of law applies to everyone equally. (0:06:14.6) It applies to those in power and those who give them power. Everyone equal under the law. If we start there I think this town can move forward and heal. Selective enforcement, who gets to speak, how long they get to speak, favors given and taken. If we start with equal treatment, a lot of the animosity and tension would dissipate. It’s a simple thing. If we treat everybody equal, rich, poor, right, left, young, old. We’re all human beings. There’s a lot more than unites us than separates us. I think that’s clear today by the turnout.

JJ: The last 24 hours, we’ve seen a pretty typical slice of Quartzsite. Hot weather, monsoon, power outage, name calling, support. The question is where do we go from here. Quartzsite has made a national name not because of issues unique to the town, but because a unique set of circumstances have touched a nerve across the country, where people are saying this is going on in my town, in my county. If the people of Quartzsite can restore the rule of law, which is all we’re asking for. We’re not asking for the state to run the town, no one in this town wants to disincorporate. Well Michael, but you can talk to him about that later. Our county is going through the same thing. I think we have an opportunity, the world is watching Quartzsite, while we succeed or fail? Can Quartzsite can go from being the example of everything that can go wrong with municipal government and move forward into everything that can go right when the government is restored to the people? (0:09:06.9) It’s not about me or Ed. It’s about these officers respecting the oath they took. I want to see this town go back to the people. I want the people’s voice to be heard. The people here don’t always agree, but if they have the right to talk and have their voices heard, they can come up with the solutions to the problem we face together.

EA: To celebrate the honor, integrity, and courage of people who will stand up. Who will put their careers on the line to do the right thing. OK is about keeping that oath to the Constitution, both the federal and the state of Arizona. We support any law officer or peace officer, soldier, fire fighter, EMT who will serve the spirit and letter of the law, of our founding documents, the US Constitution. Today we’re going to bring Sgt William Pontz. I’m going to introduce OK founder, Yale Law School graduate, former staffer for Ron Paul. This is Stewart Rhodes from Montana.

SR: Here we are today, this is a team effort. We’ve got the Greater Phoenix Tea Party Patriots, Kelly Townsend is here, she’s the leader and founder of that organization. We have Tony Martinez, founder of Sons of Liberty Riders. We have Campaign for Liberty here, and many other patriot groups from across the state of Arizona (0:11:51.5). What has to happen across the country is what’s happening here. This is about setting the example for the rest of the country. We have 10 good officers in this case. Most of you folks remember in Tucson, where we had an oath breaking sheriff who violated the rights of citizens by conducting search warrants with a SWAT team. We were down there and took care of business there too, called them out for breaking their oath. We’re here today to support 10 officers who did the right thing and kept their oath, listened to their conscience, and refused to follow unlawful, unconstitutional orders. That’s why we’re here. We’re also here to honor an oath keeping mayor, Ed Foster. Marine veteran who also stepped up and kept his oath. They set the example for what we all must do. The officers are the example for all current-serving police and military in this country, for what they should be doing. Do the right thing, keep your oath. The mayor, Jennifer Jones the activist and Michael Roth the activist, are examples of what we the citizens should be doing. Step up and run for office. If you don’t like what’s going on with the good old boy network in your town, step up and replace them. Get the oath breakers out of office, replace them with oath keepers. (0:13:25.8)

SR: If everybody across the country did what’s happening right here right now, we would restore our republic and our liberty. It can be done in one or two election cycles, kicking out the bums and voting in the patriots, those who will keep their oath.

Someone in the crowd: Let’s kick them out now Stewart

SR: That’s right. It’s why we’re here today.

Someone else in the crowd: Paper ballot

SR: Doing it now. This is the start. We want to set the example here in Quartzsite. The eyes of the entire country are on this town. Do what’s right here. Show the positive example for the rest of the country, and they will follow suit. As Jennifer said earlier, the same thing is happening across the country. (0:14:10.4) There’s corruption in every community, there’s abuse of power in every community. There’s also American patriots in every community. You veterans have an obligation under your oath. When you took that oath, however long it’s been, that’s when you lost the option of ducking out. You have an obligation and a duty to step up just like this. Don’t be afraid to be seen in public. Don’t be afraid to be on some list. Put us all on a list, the list becomes useless. Put every American oath-sworn veteran on that friggin list, go right ahead. I also want to thank Representative Carl Seel and Representative Judy Burges who are here today to stand with us for clean government, transparency in government, and keeping the oath. They’ll be speaking later today. Right now, we want to honor the Quartzsite 10, those honorable oath-sworn officers current serving. We have our small token of appreciation for them. Please, Officer Pontz, step forward and receive our token of appreciation. We’d like to give each of them an OK challenge coin, 1 oz of silver, it has our 10 orders listed on it.

SR: So if he’s at a bar, if someone throws out a bronze challenge coin, he can throw out a silver one. And guess who’s buying. Bronze is buying. So thank you Officer Pontz, we’d like to honor you with this small token of appreciation for honoring your oath.

## It’s an OK certificate

## EA reads off the list of the 10 officers. They each get a certificate

SR: Jennifer gets a Bronze challenge coin. Like I said, Jennifer is a good example of what each American should be doing. If you see something wrong in your community, step up and fix it.

EA: We have one for the mayor too.

SR: Mayor Foster is also a Marine veteran. He’s gets a silver challenge coin.

EF: Once a Marine, always a Marine. (0:19:55.2) I believe in the oath I took, as a Marine, and as the Mayor. When you swear to uphold the Constitution, I take that very seriously. Freedom of speech is 1A, and that’s the first thing we’re dealing with today.

EA: Speaking of oath keepers. [a few seconds aren’t intelligible] Rep Carl Seel and Rep Judy Burges are here with us today, standing for the constitutions of Arizona and the U.S. And for the moral right of the American tradition of freedom. We thank you both. If you would say a couple of words. Judy Burges first.

JB: It isn’t easy to maintain our freedom. We have those who seek to control. They’re standing against those who want self-reliance. It’s important these days that we stand behind the rule of law, which guarantees our individual freedoms. As far as I’m concerned, there’s no country in the world like the USA (0:21:33.6).

EA: Carl Seel

CS: God bless America. A great American said once, live free or die. I’m so proud to be here, thank you for inviting me. It’s a pleasure and an honor to stand beside law enforcement officers that uphold the oath they take seriously, as well as your great mayor. I’d like to ask, I’d like to pray for the Mayor and these officers. Pray with me please. (0:22:07.7)

CS: Lord Jesus, we thank you that you have given us a free nation, and you have given us the responsibility to be salt and light in times of challenge. I thank you Lord that this mayor and these find police officers are being salt and light in a time of challenge. Lord hold them up, put a hedge of protection around them, guard their hearts and minds in you Christ Jesus. In Jesus precious name we pray.

EA: A couple of words from Kelly Townsend, from the Greater Phoenix Tea Party Patriots.

KT: Hello fellow terrorists out there (0:22:53.0). How about some veterans, raise your hand. Give them a round of applause. How about Americans, we got any Americans here? Thank you for coming. We have someone from the Bay area that came. Anybody from out of state? How far? Wow, that’s amazing. Florida? Kenya?

Someone in crowd: I haven’t been there yet. Ask Obama

KT: We’ve had a few people in Phoenix asking what we’re doing in Quartzsite, we have issues here, aren’t you the Greater Phoenix Tea Party? What are you doing out there, it’s not your business. Is Quartzsite everybody’s business? That’s right. I was waiting for Mike Bermhead on KFYI 550 to talk about the issue, breaking news going on in Quartzsite. He said I’ll be back with Jennifer Jones at whatever time it was. I ran in the house, came back to the car real quick and turned on the radio. And I heard him talking about the tyranny and all this stuff going on. I thought gosh, he started early. (0:24:32.8) He must be talking about Quartzsite already. Then he mentions Obama. So you’ve got Quartzsite and DC and everything in between. Do we have business in Quarzsite? Absolutely. Do we have business in DC? Absolutely. Every one of us has to stand up. One of our first slogans when we started this was not my Arizona. You guys remember that in the military, not in my navy? Not in our Arizona, and not in our country. Thank you for coming out, god bless you, and god bless the USA.

## Video jumps at 0:25:18.6

CS: I represent a district in north-central Phoenix. You’re probably saying, what are we doing here? When laws are broken and when liberty’s in jeopardy, it doesn’t matter whether you’re in the middle of Quartzsite or the middle of Compton or the middle of Phoenix. I wanted to share a couple of thoughts about my experiences with law enforcement in my district. I’m going to tell you about a committee I chair, too. I’m gonna keep it brief.

CS: One of the people I would have gotten to represent was a gentleman named Officer Nick Erfly, had he lived after being gunned down by an illegal alien gun dealer in the streets of Phoenix. Simply because the officer stopped him for jaywalking. The guy turned around at point blank range and blew the officer away. His name is memorialized at a memorial in the Capitol. I frequently visit that memorial to remind me what I’m there to do as a public servant. That’s a large reason I’m here today. I was fortunate that my good friend and colleague Judy Burges invited me to come with her. I’m happy and proud to be here today.

CS: (0:26:48.2) I get to serve. I’ve been at the state legislature for 2.5 years now. The first several years, I learned that you gotta look at the budget and where we spend our money, and I want to reduce fraud and waste and abuse. How many of you think it’s a good idea to check the dead people on public assistance? Do you think we should pay $75 million a year for taxis when people take a bus? You probably don’t think that’s a good idea. We could use that money to fund vital services like transplants and mammograms and insulin pumps. What do you think is more important, mammograms or taxi rides? According to documents I got from the Obama White House, taxis are more important than transplant patients.

Someone in the crowd: That’s if you’re a taxicab owner.

CS: (0:27:53.3) One thing I asked to do was serve as the chair of the joint legislative audit committee. That doesn’t sound very exciting, but it has the ability to look into all forms of government. I had some time with your mayor today, I’m struck by what’s going on here, and the documents he’s legally and legitimately asked for and has been denied. Mayor Foster, where is he? He’s campaigning, that’s good. You gotta get reelected. Mayor Foster, I want you to know, I’m standing in front of your constituents and I’m publicly committing and chair of the Joint Legislative Audit Committee to do all I can to get the proper documents you’ve been asking for legally from the government entities in this town. (0:29:02.6)

CS: I recently had to go to PA, my dad passed away of cancer a month and a half ago. I’m at peace about it. I got to visit him for 3 weeks, and it was very good. He was in PA. Then I got to visit Independence Hall in Philadelphia, the first time I got to do that. There’s something about that experience. One of the people that helped write the Declaration of Independence and our Constitution and helped steer the foundation of our country, Benjamin Franklin, was asked as he was leaving the Constitutional Convention upon ratifying our country, was asked what did you guys do? He said we’ve given you a republic, if you can keep it. I’m challenging you here. How many of you here live locally? It’s incumbent on those who live here, you have to go out and multiply yourselves by four. Each of you have to go get four new voters. Make sure they vote next Tuesday. If we’re going to keep the republic, if we’re going to preserve liberty, it’s going to be with you guys. There are people like myself and Judy and a great many others who are right here with you. Thanks for your time today. In the immortal words of Patrick Henry, give me liberty or give me death. (0:31:14.8)

TM: I’m the national president and founder of the Sons of Liberty Riders. I want to read some of my thoughts to you. In these times of uncertainty and confusion, when our country drowns in an ocean of debt, when our elected officials are more concerned about their own security than the security of their constituents, when the policies of our government strike at the essence of what this country was founded on, when the Constitution is being reduced to the point where it can no longer serve as the protector of American liberty, I say it’s a great day to be an American. Nothing easy is worth working for. Nothing free is worth fighting for. Nothing cheap is worth sacrificing for. Nothing mundane can hold the hopes and aspirations of so many good people. We work, we fight, we sacrifice, keeping a watchful eye on the present, reflecting on the past, and hopeful for the future. (0:32:17.2) In a diary belonging to an American soldier in WW1 under the heading my pledge, he wrote this words. I must win this war. Therefore I will work, I will save, I will sacrifice, I will endure, I will fight cheerfully and do my utmost, as if the issue of the whole struggle depends on me alone. The soldier, Martin Tripto, was killed on the Western Front carrying a message between battalions. Ronald Reagan said of this story, the crisis we are facing today does not require of us the kind of sacrifice this man and so many others were called upon to make. It does require our best effort and our willingness to believe in ourselves and in our capacity to perform great deeds, to believe that together with god’s help, we can and will resolve the problems which now confront us. (0:33:10.3) Those of you here today understand the 3 key elements to success in this struggle: strength, conviction, and courage. First is strength. This is not only personal strength, also collective. Your voice must join with others in a chorus that will sound with truth and unity. How many voices will be needed for this is no small undertaking, the truth is we need every patriot willing and able to join the cause. These are the times that men’s souls. The summer soldier and sunshine patriot will, in this crisis, shrink from the service of his country. But he that stands by it now deserves the love and thanks of men and women. The second element is conviction. As the days march forward, many faces you saw just a few months ago are no longer standing with you today. There are many reasons for their absence. Some thought victory would be quick and decisive. This has never been the case. Some were with you for the wrong reasons, and in time opened their eyes to the truth about themselves. Some thought this was going to be easy, never counting on the amount of dedication and work. Some felt this would come with no price tag. Those who have stood together for our country and our convictions know the cost, in time, in money, in lost friends. For some, like the Quartzsite 10, the cost of their convictions could be their way of life. For some like our soldiers, the price comes much higher. In the beginning of change, the patriot is a scarce man, brave, hated, and scorned. When his cause succeeds, the timid join him, for it costs nothing to be a patriot then. The third element is courage to stand for your convictions in the face of authority. The courage to carry on with what you believe in while others around you ridicule those beliefs. The courage to stay the course through the attacks and accusations of those who would have our attacks fail. There are those who fear the retaliation of the political machine, afraid to be counted along with those that dare to be counted. The truth is their fear is misplaced, for there are far more of us now than there had been a few months ago. The citizens of this great nation are discovering a new reality, a reality that challenges the benevolence and purpose of an all-powerful government, that challenges the socialist agenda of shared misery and mediocrity, that challenges the empty promises, lies, and corruption of elected officials, that is all too aware of the words of Thomas Jefferson who said a government big enough to give you everything you need is a government big enough to take away everything you have. Today we are gathered as friends and patriots, speaking out in a very different time, but under very similar circumstances as the patriots before us. (0:35:56.1) In the days ahead, we must remember the spirit that called together these great men of American history. Bound by a common cause, they stood together for what they believed in, against what seemed like insurmountable odds. Will we be ready to answer the call? The test of our resolve may soon be upon us. Will we have the courage to stand together in defiance of an unjust government, or will we shrink from our duties, while all that was fought for by our forefathers is destroyed before our eyes. Ronald Reagan wrote, freedom is never more than one generation away from extinction. We didn’t pass it to our children in the bloodstream. It must be fought for, protected, and handed on for them to do the same. Or one day we will spend our sunset years telling our children and our children’s children what it was once like in America, when men were free. Will ours be the generation asleep at the wheel while the light and beacon of freedom is extinguished forever? Not on our watch. It is imperative that we remember today what our Founding Fathers knew back then. God created the people, the people created the states, the states created the federal government. This is the way the power is intended to flow. We must never forget this. It is at the heart of the anguish and confusion and discontent felt throughout these United States. We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal. That they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights. That among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. That to secure these rights, governments are instituted among men, deriving their just power from the consent of the governed. This bold statement set in motion the belief that power rested with the people, and not with the government. Its ideals born from a fledgling society held under the tyrannical rule of a king far away across a sea. But the Founders also realized that tyranny could rise from within, that man was corruptible and that governments formed for the people would grow hungry for power and wealth (0:37:54.9). Eventually turning away from their appointed duties, usurping power from those it was designed to serve. Whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the right of people to abolish or alter it, and institute new government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its power in such form as to them shall seem most likely to affect their safety and happiness. Across this great country of ours, citizens are awaking to the possibility that we can make a difference in how our government is run. Through orgs like ours, members of the Sons of Liberty are empowered by our strength, conviction, and courage. I encourage each of you to become an active participant in a group of your choosing, one that represents your beliefs. It is with this call to unity that we must face the problems that confront us today, by recognizing that because of years of complacency, we are experiencing what the Founders tried so hard to prevent. Understanding that we the people hold the power to our salvation and the masters of our collective destiny, we can understand that with strength, conviction, and courage, a future filled with the actions of an informed, engaged citizenry can set things right. (0:39:12.3)

## There’s a sentence in here that distills the idea of sovereignty and political power.

BH: I’m actually here from America, that would work. I do solemnly swear that I will support the Constitution for the United States and the Constitution and laws of the state of Arizona. That I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same, and defend them against all enemies, foreign and domestic. And that I will faithfully and impartially discharge the duties of my office according to the best of my abilities, so help me god. That’s a simple oath, there’s not much to it. So why is it so damn hard for our public officials to keep it? That’s what we’re here for. Only a handful make the attempt. Today, we join in solidarity with these few. It’s a pleasure to stand with the Q-10, the officers who refused to participate in what they believed to be acts of corruption for a chief who seems more akin to a cartoon character than a peace officer. These officers deserve our respect, and we salute them (0:40:45.2). It’s a pleasure to share this stage with Mayor Foster and Reps Burges and Seel, who take our individual liberties seriously. It’s honor to be here with SR, Ernest Hancock, Jennifer Jones, Jordan Page, and all the other champions of the rule of law who gathered here today to express their commitment to individual liberty. Most of all, it’s an honor to be here with you, those who care to show up today, to show your support. Thank you for supporting our uniquely American ideals.

BH: Why do we support this tiny community against a corrupt and out of control town council that has become nothing more than a glorified HOA, filled with individuals who suffer from a particularly destructive form of the little Hitler syndrome? We support you because we know that in America, for any of us to be free from oppression and tyranny, we must stand all for one and one for all. If not, none of us nor our children will know the sweet taste of the fruit of the liberty tree (0:42:12.3). Quartzsite represents every single town and city across this nation. If we allow the outrageous acts of corrupt officials to continue unabated here, these acts will bleed into every single community in America, and she will be gone. There’s no place we can run or hide, so we must stand and defend here now our fellow citizens and those principles of our birthright on which this nation was founded. (0:42:54.3) We cannot let the atrocities continue. The abolitionist Frederick Douglass expressed it very well when he said the limits of tyranny are defined by those who are oppressed? Have you had enough yet? I’ve had enough. Let’s make a loud, clear, resonant message that here in Quartzsite, AZ, the people have reached the point beyond which they cannot be pushed. The governor, the attorney general, and even the county sheriff have failed to uphold their primary responsibility, while a renegade town council along with a police chief and his loyal minions have committed acts that demand prosecution. They’ve left the people here unprotected and with no alternative other than to protect themselves. When in the midst of rampant corruptions and clear abrogation of free speech, an errant judge rules in favor of an admittedly armed and psychologically disturbed councilman to disarm his potential victim, something is fundamentally wrong. It’s a recipe for disaster. This is why I’ve often said, 2A was purposely placed as backup in case 1A didn’t get the job done. While most of us do know that corruption in Quartzsite is not a new item on the menu, it started with this peaceful hamlet’s incorporation. The only peaceful alternative we must face is to simply incorporate this town and rid the good people of these dregs of society who are attracted positions of power. Before that happens, I believe the corrupt officials in this instance should be humiliated, charged for their crimes, stripped of their positions, fines in accordance with their acts of corruption, and jailed again. (0:45:21.1) To serve as an example to all the other little Hitlers who might find themselves tempted to abuse their sacred trust. Who brought the tar? Who’s got the feathers? That we might set things right in Quartzsite, AZ.

JJ: I’m just a pet groomer, that’s what they said. I’m just one vote. (0:45:52.7) I’m just nothing. I’m just one person, what can one person do?

Person in the crowd: You can kick ass

JJ: 3.5 years ago, I was either in the wrong place at the wrong time or the right place at the right time, depending on if you consider this all coming together because of what happened one spring day 3.5 years ago. I minding my own business. A code enforcement officer and police officer showed up and were giving my neighbor in swap meet a hard time. He said, can do this? Can they run me out of here? Is this legal? I said no I don’t think so, but let’s go to the library tomorrow and look it up. Then they turned around and said, who are you? (0:46:45.9) I’m just the lady grooming dogs. I didn’t think anybody didn’t like me. I’d been teaching dog bite safety to the children’s after school program, marched in the parade, gave food to the hungry guy on the corner or a jacket to somebody who looked like they needed it. A lot of people come here just to survive through the winter. Everybody comes to town broke and hope they leave with enough to come back and do it again next year. I didn’t come here to get rich or famous or infamous. I stood up to that code enforcement officer and that police officer, I said with all due respect, if you have some local ordinance that says I can’t be here, even though you gave me a license and I’ve had it for 8 years now, I’d like to see that ordinance. The code enforcement officer said if I have to show you that ordinance, I’m just going to come back and cite you. I said, I volunteer with the National Dog Registry, I’m the executive director of legislative affairs. I keep the state law on my hard drive. I’d still like to see that ordinance. Instead, the code enforcement officer at the time went back to town hall, pulled my permit out of the file, wrote revoked across it, and called the county animal control to tell them here’s a woman running an illegal kennel on a revoked license, the animals are in danger you need to get over there. Within 45 minutes of my conversation with the code enforcement officer, here comes animal control. I’m not stupid. I’ve been helping dog owners fight small town government, sometimes misguided, uninformed or misinformed local legislators. I even had written an article on what to do in this scenario, I thought I was prepared. I said you can see my dogs, as long as I can see your warrant. He said I don’t need a warrant. I said with all due respect, you need a warrant to come in my house. There’s my grooming shop, with a poodle waiting for a haircut. But if you want to come in my house, you need a warrant. (0:49:30.8) I didn’t have anything to hide, but that wasn’t the point. I had a litter of championship puppies, just a few weeks old. This guy touches roadkill for a living, I didn’t want him in my house. In Pema County, the Human Society of the United States and a well-respected breeder, he was accused of being a dog fighter. He was acquitted of that, but because he was accused of being a dog fighter, they were allowed to roll a tank through his front yard, pulled an elderly couple out of bed with rifles pointed at their heads, confiscated their dogs. That one particular charge allowed the state to confiscate their dogs and they couldn’t get them back unless they posted a bond. Something like $12 per dog per day. I was doing the math that day, counting up my dogs. I said wow, I’d need $50k to save my dogs’ lives. I don’t carry that kind of money around. I work part-time, I have a bad back, I came here to slow down and retire. I’m thinking about my friend, who lost his dogs, they were all euthanized before he was even arraigned on charges. His entire life’s work. They killed his animals, they also put a lien against his property, they said he was conspiring, that RICO thing. His wife lost her mother’s house, they lost their kennel. In the end, they were acquitted, exonerated of every charge. So this happened a month before these people came to my door, so my heart was racing. But I told myself I could do this, I spent years telling other people what to do when this happens. I stayed calm and convinced them to leave without taking my dogs. Maybe they changed their mind when they came in my house and saw my dogs barking and realized they’d have to remove a dozen pitbulls. (0:52:16.5) I got to keep my dogs, and I got a ticket for not having a county kennel permit. Under state law, I didn’t need one. State law trumps county ordinance. So I thought I’ll fight the ticket. I went before a hearing board officer. Not a court of record, not somebody who went to law school. This person is now one of our county supervisors, Mr. John Drum. I have the audio from the hearing, he said that might be what the law says, but that’s not what it means. I said the law is very clear. But yes, if the town isn’t going to enforce a kennel ordinance, then I’m going to come in and do it. So I appealed, represented myself. On appeal, it was heard by the County Board of Supervisors and the County Attorney. He said, she’s right. We don’t have jurisdiction in Quartzsite. I believe we incorporated in 1989. That one statement meant that La Paz County had been writing illegal tickets in Quartzsite, collecting illegal money, since the ink was dry on the articles of incorporation on the town. (0:53:35.4) I thought great, I showed them, I didn’t break any law, maybe they’ll leave me alone. That didn’t happen. In town hall, when they wrote me that ticket and I had to cancel my plans for the summer and had to stay and fight it and prove I was right. A friend of mine was on the town council then, a guy named Bill Moore. He told me he was in Town Hall when they were talking about this. They said she’s just a vendor, what difference does it make, what could she do? That really got to me, I thought what can I do. I hear this a lot, over the years with the dog thing. Can they take my dogs? Did you let them? They can do whatever you let them, you give them the power. They don’t have that power inherently. It’s not the tyrant’s fault, it’s the coward’s fault. It’s the guy who won’t go to the meeting, who isn’t willing to get frog-marched out of a meeting and arrested for disorderly conduct. It’s not the tyrant’s fault for being human and taking advantage of a sweet situation. It’s the fault of the people who refuse to stand up for their god-given rights. Maybe they don’t know their rights. I said maybe I should educate them. I’ve learned a lot over the last decade, maybe I should share that information. I decided to publish a newspaper, tell people what’s going on. I hadn’t even published my first issue, I had just mentioned on the internet that I was going to do this, and I got arrested for being assaulted by the building official. He came onto the property we leased, I asked him to leave, it was déjà vu, he said ma’am you don’t have any rights, you don’t own this property. We got this on video, we carry video cameras everywhere. The camera’s the new gun, I hope you all realize that. (0:55:56.8) I’d hang on to the old gun, but the camera is the new gun. If you point the camera at them, I’ve noticed the cowards complain about it. Our police chief said we can’t do our job, they’re pointing cameras at us everywhere we go. All of these things happened because I said no. I’m not packing and leaving, my rent is paid. No I’m not going to let you come into my house without a warrant. I said no, what you’ve done to the people before me isn’t acceptable. It wasn’t about me, I just wanted people to feel safe in their own town. I want people to feel like they can vote or sign a petition or speak at Town Hall and not be afraid to speak. I just want people to feel free to exercise the rights they were given by people far wiser than myself. What can one person do? Let’s find out. If one person stands with one person and another and another, what can one person do. I appreciate you for coming. You came and helped us, so if I can help you and support you, please let me know.

UM: We’re starting 2 Ron Paul Meetup groups in La Paz County. One for Quartzsite and one for the Parker area. Call me if you’re interested in helping. We’re gonna get Ron Paul back on the map. By the way, this whole thing is a result of the Ron Paul movement of 4 years ago. (0:58:40.6) 4 years ago, I was being harassed, bullied, pushed around by the chief of police. I got involved in the Ron Paul movement. Next thing you know, Jennifer was being pushed around, she had a big old Ron Paul banner on her trailer. We decided we’re not going to take it anymore, we’re going to stand up and fight for what’s right. It’s taken this long to get this far. This is the result of what started 4, 5 years ago. Stewart just shared with me how OK is a result of the Ron Paul movement. After the last campaign, he said what next and started OK. If anybody is interested in spreading ideas about freedom and liberty, give me a call. I’m in Quartzsite. My number is easy to remember, it’s 927-8888. We want to start more Ron Paul action in the county.

WP: Thank you for coming out and supporting us. I’m WP, president of Quartzsite Police Officers Association and former Sgt at Quartzsite PD. I was terminated wrongfully. I want to say thank you. We were just doing what’s right. I want to introduce these people. These are some of the Quartzsite 10 that were able to make it today. We’re feeling the retribution and retaliation right now for doing what’s right. That’s said. (1:01:07.9) We’ll make it through this. We’re proud to be Americans and do what’s right, take back our country and do what we need to do to get it going in the right direction and not where it’s going now. One thing we’re doing, to assist us in our legal endeavors, it’s very costly, we have a fund at Quartzsitefund.com or Quartzsitefund.org. We have a blogspot too. We appreciate any kind of help, donation. You can also find us on Facebook.

UM2: (1:02:30.0) I want to give a different presentation. I want to make sure you understand why a lot of us are here. You’ll see a lot of talk about the Constitution, about Dr. Paul, about liberty, freedom. Why it is that so many people from around the state, surrounding states, the country, even the planet, are interested in what’s going on here. It’s because everywhere, people are going through exactly the same thing for exactly the same reasons with exactly the same stereotypical people in positions of power. They empathize with you because they are going through this and they need to understand it as much as you do. That’s what we try to do. At Freedom’s Phoenix, we’ve been following Quartzsite for at least 15 years. A lot of you haven’t been in the movement that long. Some of you haven’t even lived here that long. Some of you haven’t been awake to what’s going on in the world that long. Egg timer, Ernie’s got the microphone, we’ll set it for 3 or 4 minutes. Whenever you create positions of power, you’ll always have the worst of people who try to gain those positions of power. Whenever the argument is made, we have to have government to protect us from the bad people, because there are bad people out there. Why would you take something as precious as individual rights and freedom and turn it over to the very worst of society? It’s always the worst people that will work so hard to seek positions of power to be able to tell you how to live. We’re always warned. We say look man, eternal vigilance. (1:04:38.6) We have to be very careful about who we allow to be in those positions and put big time, strict chains on them about what they can do. When they start getting into positions of power and make decisions that benefit themselves financially at the expense of the rights of the individual, once it starts it never stops. Quartzsite is so important because you have one main law enforcer, one main city prosecutor, one town manager, one person in the judicial process – justice of the peace or municipal judge. It’s easy to see these types of positions in Quartzsite at the county, state, and federal level. Mayor Foster comes in with your support and says I want to find out what’s going on, you can’t find it out. You go to the next level, and the next level. You find out this tyranny goes all the way up and support all the way down. That’s why we’re interested. I can go into a lot. You’ve got a pushpin in Quartzsite for a lot of reasons, you need to find out why. If you go to Freedom’s Phoenix and you look up Quartzsite, you’ll see a lot of radio shows and articles that we’ve done, so you can understand what’s happening across the nation. That’s why they’re interested. They want you to find out. It has to do with, you have to create a structure so you can have a municipal water system, to pay for it you jack up the prices, by having it you qualify for government grants, you take grants and consolidate power. You buy land, position yourself with zoning, get rid of the riff raff, people who aren’t ready to be told what to do. Start developments that benefit people up, up, up, up. Sound familiar? See a pattern? Until you understand this, it will grow in Quartzsite and devour the entire planet. We know this. The Constitution was there to put restrictions on those in government. The Bill of Rights was the compromise they made with the Anti-Federalists, the Libertarians of the day. What happens when you make a centralized government with the power of eminent domain, the power to tax, the power to regulate commerce. The Libertarians of the day said that’s too much centralized power. So they had the Bill of Rights. The Bill of Rights is 10 Thou Shalt Nots of Government. Count on, where the rubber meets the road, you have these law enforcement officers, they should be peace officers. They’re going, we’re here to keep the peace, make sure you don’t aggress against your fellow man. The role of government is to defend the rights of the individual. When it becomes obvious that they’re the tools of the government, that’s why you don’t have your rights, they’re taking them away, it’s time to alter and abolish. We want to help.

<content:encoded>Rick, with all due respect, that is exactly the defeatist attitude the government hopes we will all have. One motivated individual can change the world. I aim to keep my oath as my forefathers before me fought so bravely to defend. Not on my watch!!! God Bless America!! Si Vis Pacem Para Bellum!

<content:encoded>I applaud and “Thank” every Oath Keeper in this organization.  We need tools like this movie to help share what is happening in and to our great nation.  I believe a large majority people in our country are so busy working hard just to keep a roof overhead and raise their family’s they don’t have time to search independent news sources to learn the nefarious actions surfacing all around them in regard to Jade Helm.  Most people might recognize ‘something doesn’t seem right’ but have a very hard time believing such a violation of the constitution is taking place.  A friend sent me this quote from a book written by Mark Blitz.  In my mind I can insert “America” in place of the Jewish people.  “Having had two relatives die in the Holocaust, I will never stand idly by while the enemy attacks!  Never again will the Jewish people go down as lambs to the slaughter on my watch.  I’m in this to the glorious end.  We are all going to die anyway, so let’s go in glory!  For believers, there is no need to be afraid of death.  We just change clothes, so to speak.  My only fear is not having completed the job God gave me to do.”   God Bless and Protect Every One of You!

<content:encoded>The talk about a movie (Midnight Ride) is interesting but will accomplish nothing to delay or stop the government’s actions toward martial law as evidenced by Jade Helm 15.  This movie will not even exist until long after our corrupt, evil government has accomplished its goal of getting the American sheeple used to martial law constraints.<br/>
Here, in Tucson Arizona, we have witnessed huge 3-piece metal towers (approximately 75-100 feet tall) being transported by commercial tractor-trailer rigs down south toward the Mexican border areas.  Nobody is certain where they end up being sent, but the top section of each tower includes HUGE four sided tops that look like they have huge speakers on two side and huge lights (similar to the lights used at sports stadiums) on the other two sides.  We saw at least 15 of these towers being moved from the east side of town, south toward the border.  The towers come in 3 sections, with each section being so large the big rigs can only load and move one section at a time, and the sections taper from bottom to top.  All of these are painted a sandstone (desert camouflage) color.<br/>
I went to a doctor’s appointment this morning and I saw four different large trucks on the road (in town) hauling all sorts of military style vehicles, huge generators, and other heavy equipment.<br/>
For an “exercise”, the government sure is positioning a lot of heavy-duty equipment somewhere in our southern Arizona areas.

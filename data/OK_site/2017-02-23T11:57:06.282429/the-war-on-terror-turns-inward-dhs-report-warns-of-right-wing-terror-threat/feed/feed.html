<content:encoded>Cal ….nice!  (Best “all true and most captivating, and hopefully ‘eye-opening’, for others not as ‘fluent’ in historical (hysterical?) events.  I salute you.

<content:encoded>“The Government is very much like a living organism at the end of its life cycle.” – Bang on! They depend on the citizenry for much of their logistical needs, ie. food, vehicle maintenance, HVAC for their buildings, etc. This is their Achilles heel and if they go full bore Stalinist, citizens who have friends or relatives abused by them, might see to it that totalitarian logistical needs  get problematic, most ricki-tic.

<content:encoded>“What you are about to read from CNN is just the very beginning of the intentional demonization of a growing segment of the U.S. population that rightly believes the government is run by a collective of thieving, corrupt, immoral sociopaths.”
<p>“Media/Journalists” or to be truthful, corporate PSYOPS employees ought to be 100 mph taped to a chair and forced to listen to Prof CJs podcasts: <a href="http://profcj.org/ep-0002-prof-cjs-approach-history-part-2/" rel="nofollow">http://profcj.org/ep-0002-prof-cjs-approach-history-part-2/</a></p>

<content:encoded>Never mind, I Googled the information.  One site was <a href="http://www.dcclothesline.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.dcclothesline.com</a>
<p><a href="http://www.dcclothesline.com/2014/12/16/need-mraps-deal-constitutionalists-deputys-comments-ignite-firestorm-spokane-valley-washington/" rel="nofollow">http://www.dcclothesline.com/2014/12/16/need-mraps-deal-constitutionalists-deputys-comments-ignite-firestorm-spokane-valley-washington/</a></p>
<p>It is Spokane, Washington.  I watched the videos, too.  </p>
<p>Sheriff Knezovich sounds like a Russian name.  I have heard and read that there are MANY Russian people here, that have a neutral native Nebraskan accent, which, is NO accent at all, and, they’re in offices, departments, and agencies in the U.S.  They look just like we do, and talk just like we do.  </p>
<p>The Deputy, I do not believe, was joking at all, that the MRAP are for the Constitutionalists.  He may have been joking, but, the TRUTH concealed and cloaked in the joke, NO DOUBT.      </p>
<p>So many put truth in a joke, TRUTH cloaked as or in a joke.  </p>
<p>Why else do departments and agencies have them?  It’s to take on the American People, the Constitutionalists, and preppers..</p>

<content:encoded>Using US statistics, only one criminal comes over of every 100 illegals, barring illegal entry.  How often do our criminals flee to Mexico per 100 Americans going there to establish residency?   We are looking to big government to manage the details of immigration when we want less government FTEs; something is wrong with this picture.  We are seeking to reduce our Aircraft carrier inventory to 10 when half the world wants the USA to disappear?  With one in each of the seven seas, and three to cover the east, west, and Gulf coasts, leaves none for AK and HI.  Carrier reduction may dig away at the national debt but it feels like getting caught with my pants down on an aunt hill.  Do we want a fancy wall at the expense of a Navy with only two hand fulls of carrier groups?  President Teddy Roosavelt had it right — “walk softly and carry a big stick!”  I think campaign reform should benefit the poor and displaced citizens of the USA, all potential voters.  Give about half the PAC monies to non-profit charities that directly benefit our poor, destitute, disabled, homeless and mentally ill; it might be enough money to solve  these problems.  Our national think tank, the Congress, seems to be thinking only with the sitting parts, not their discerning parts,  they seem to think they are thinking globally when they cannot even manage our ills locally.  Can our voices fix this?  Our ballot?

<content:encoded>The border should be sealed. I personally would give to pay per view to watch that show. Criminals are pouring into our nation to change the voter landscape. We are being transformed one illegal at a time.

<content:encoded>The border with the U.S. Is a safety valve for the corrupt Mexican government. 90% of their military is within 100 miles of the Northern border, chaos will ensue if the border is ever sealed.

<content:encoded>With this Jade Helm taking place in the southwest and this TAA and TPP about to take of in the US , I would guess that the Mexicans are getting ready for a large influx of the ten million illegal people over here to head south when the crap hits the fan . Just a wild guess

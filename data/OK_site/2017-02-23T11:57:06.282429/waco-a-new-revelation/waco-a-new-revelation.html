<h2 class="fn entry-title">“Warning to U.S. Military and Federal LEOs: Do Not Follow Orders to “Waco” Ammon Bundy Occupation, or Risk Civil War”</h2>
<p>Of particular interest to me is Stewart’s use of the name “Waco”.</p>
<p>On April 19 in 2016 the nation will reflect once again on Waco. The date will mark the twenty-third anniversary of one of the most cruel, insane, and even demonic actions ever perpetrated by the U.S. government upon its own citizens. It is not the only cruel and insane event done by government to the governed, but it is one of the most horrendous.</p>
<p><a href="../wp-content/uploads/2016/01/waco-texas_ammoland.jpg"><img alt="waco-texas_ammoland" class=" wp-image-9592 alignleft" height="359" src="../wp-content/uploads/2016/01/waco-texas_ammoland.jpg" width="462"/></a>As an older man I recall seeing the burning of that church in Texas while at a restaurant in Georgia. The entire restaurant was glued to the TV screen in disbelief. All we had heard was that the church had been molesting little children and manufacturing illegal drugs. That, a sickened nation would later learn, was a pack of lies made up by the ATF and presented to the Pentagon in hopes of getting military aid in resolving the standoff which resulted from the botched raid on the church.</p>
<p>The church had been assaulted by the ATF in a very stupid raid to garner support for the ATF’s increased budget requests due before Congress, a fact we learned in retrospect from the Dallas Morning News. As it turns out, the ATF had notified the press that there would be a newsworthy event at Waco and the ATF actually requested media coverage. <em>Why?</em></p>
<p>The ATF felt they needed something big in “the news” to push through their requested budget increases. So goes the logic of government agencies, because government agencies, as our nation’s Founders well knew, by their very nature become ruthless infrastructural mechanisms of self-perpetuation. <a href="../wp-content/uploads/2016/01/waco2.jpg"><img alt="waco2" class=" wp-image-9593 alignright" height="246" src="../wp-content/uploads/2016/01/waco2.jpg" width="327"/></a></p>
<p>So Waco has become an undying testament to the inherent abusive nature of government. The recognition of that nature, by our Founders, has much to do with why there is a Bill of Rights attached to the Constitution. But the ATF could not care less about the original intent of the Founders. Nope! The ATF marches to the beat of its own drums, fully-well knowing that according to the Constitution the agency does not even have any legitimate authority to exist, much less the authority to murder scores of women and children in horrible fiery deaths over some alleged “gun violations”. My God! The document says “.<em>..shall not be infringed.</em>”  All the ATF does is infringe, and it cares not one whit about your or my unalienable rights or our Constitutional protections as American citizens. Nope. The ATF is hell-bent on tormenting anyone who would dare stand up for the fuller meaning of our Constitution and Bill of Rights.</p>
<p>But while most readers here already know such truths, I would like to invite everyone to carefully view a movie which has been around for more than fifteen years. Those who have seen this film will learn yet more by watching it again, as I do each time I review it. Those who have not seen this owe it to themselves to inform themselves with the ghastly truth of the outright evil and domestic terror perpetrated by the ATF on a church full of good American citizens. The movie reveals the government’s feeble and vain attempts to cover-up the ATF’s sins in Congressional hearings.</p>
<p><a href="../wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Charles-Schumer.jpg"><img alt="Charles Schumer" class=" wp-image-9597 alignright" height="199" src="../wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Charles-Schumer.jpg" width="265"/></a></p>
<p><em><strong>Pay close attention to Charles Schumer’s wicked facial expressions.</strong></em></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>After watching this film, allow oneself to reflect upon what is behind Mike Vanderboegh’s famous statement, “No more free Wacos”. Then one will more fully understand why Stewart Rhodes alluded to Waco in his open letter to the military and enforcement agents who are being pulled into a possible confrontation with American citizens at Burns, Oregon.</p>

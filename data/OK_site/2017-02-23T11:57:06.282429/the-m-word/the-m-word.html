<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>The Truth Behind the Militia</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.oathkeepers.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/themword.jpg"><img alt="themword" class="aligncenter wp-image-8020" height="269" src="https://www.oathkeepers.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/themword.jpg" width="500"/></a></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The militia is defined  by Wikipedia as: an army or other fighting force that is composed of non-professional fighters; citizens of a nation or subjects of a state or government that can be called upon to enter a combat situation, as opposed to a professional force of regular, full time military personnel. It was common for militias to engage guerrilla warfare or defense instead of attacking.</p>
<p>Our founding fathers felt so strongly about our natural right to self defense and the necessity of an armed militia for the protection of that right, that they wrote it right into our founding documents.</p>
<p>The modern militia movement began to gain serious ground after the Waco incident, as we began to open our eyes, as Americans, to just how far our own government would go to set up a pretext to demonstrate the so called need for our alphabet soup agencies and their accompanying funding. After the Federal Building was bombed and the start of an intensive mis-information campaign, the movement went largely underground.</p>
<p>Today, unfortunately, due in large part to the mainstream media, SPLC, ADL and other so called watch groups, the mainstream perception of the militia is so very far from the truth. Today we are called extremists, domestic terrorists, and you can be sure to throw in a few back handed comments about us all being toothless, back-woods, hillbillies and rednecks. While a good majority of us may indeed come from a backwoods background, we need to really look at what is the truth behind the demonization. Instead of being called the derogatory, dismissive names that we are, we need to start calling the good-folks that serve in the Citizen Militia what they really are; first responders, former Military, current military, fire fighters, EMT’s, doctors, medical professionals, small business owners, husbands, wives, sons and daughters, preppers, true American Patriots, and heroes.</p>
<p>My first experience, personally, with what I would consider a real, trained, competent, and professional citizen’s militia of today, was at Bundy Ranch. Since then, I have had the honor and privilege to work, train, and deploy on patriotic operations such as Sugar Pine Mine and Lincoln County Montana with some of these incredible people. Whether it is standing guard over our own military recruiters that are not allowed by their own government to defend themselves after what any sane thinking human being would call an act of terrorism, or standing shoulder to shoulder with these fellow Americans as they took time away from their jobs and loved ones to go to Bundy Ranch and say we will not let another Waco happen on our watch.</p>
<p>I implore every American who is buying into the mainstream lies to reach out to your local militia, 3% group, or Oath Keeper chapter, and see for yourself, from your own experience, just who it is that makes up the fabric of our modern American Militia Movement.</p>
<p>Allen Lardieri, West Virginia Son’s of the Second and the militias that are in that area of the Appalachian Redoubt seem to be cut from that very fabric I am talking about. This past weekend during an aerial training session they took the time to put together this short video talking about these very subjects. Please, take the time to watch this video and share it with your fellow patriots.<br/>

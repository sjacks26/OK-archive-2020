SB: I’d like to contribute a poem to this. It’s called “On Government Land.” The government is taking away everything only to make it their own. You can’t even hold conversations on your own private telephone. They own the water, they own the air, they own everything and they own everywhere. If they can’t own it, they just steal it away, turn it into a park, and then they can say they own it. They own it with taxes, they own it with fees. No matter the cost, they do as they please. They think they own us. They treat us like cattle. They herd us like cattle and treat us like sheep. After the shearing, our fleeces to keep. Sonner or later, if we don’t take a stand, we all shall be living on government land.

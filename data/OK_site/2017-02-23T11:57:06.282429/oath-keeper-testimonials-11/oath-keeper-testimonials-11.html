<p><strong>Gregory Bennett:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Testimonial: My service in the United States Air Force Security Police as a Patrol Dog Handler and Security Specialist was a great honor performed with dedication. To defend our nation and to maintain our Cherished Freedoms and to let no one take away the principles of justice, freedom and democracy.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">My USAF service prepared me for service with the New York Guard in response to the terror attacks of September 11, 2001. I have observed the enemy in our homeland such as a bookstore clerk listening to a terrorist audio training tape, students doing assault training in a park and a terrorist training class outside an Afghan Grill in Hicksville, New York. In all cases the participants were Middle Eastern and the police in all cases did nothing telling me not to worry. One member of my New York Guard Unit Lt. Mohammed Butt stood right next to a gasoline tanker with a lit cigar. He took combat exercises seriously and even hid in a garbage dumpster. He fled to Pakistan and my unit commander said if DOD knew he was a member of Al Quiada our careers would be ruined. Another member of the New York Guard brought in his own explosives to Camp Smith. I called the FBI and State Police. Authorities didn’t even get a search warrant for the individual’s house and garage. America needs to wakeup. The FBI has linguists who refused to sign loyalty oaths to America. God Bless America and our veterans.</p>

<p>Testimonial: This is my Testimonial!!</p>
<p>I Will Stand With America<br/>
Should The Political Winds<br/>
Shift In An Ugly Direction!</p>
<p>Every one has read a different<br/>
version of this, but this is Mine!!</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Ken Crowe:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Testimonial: My name is Ken Crowe, I am a retired Vietnam era veteran who served in both the Army and Air Force. In addition, in 1964 I took my first oath to defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies and have never been released from that oath. I love this country and would do as many patriots have done before. God bless America.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">————————————————————————————————–</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>pelayo riera:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Testimonial: The second amendment gives us the ability to protect and defend the rest of our freedoms provided for in our Constitution. I stand as a testimonial as to what happens when you loose that right. My father lived in Germany when Hitler disarmed the Jews and look what happened. He later moved to Cuba where I was born in 1949. I remember him saying “it could not happen here” since Cuba had a constitution patterned after the American Constitution. After Castro took power they required all firearms be registered. Then they outlawed private ownership of firearms. I remember as a child 3 soldiers showing up to get my fathers guns. He was told if he didn’t have the guns on the list he would be going with them.My father had kept an old 1911 which he had not reported and years later he told me he did it because if he had to he would defend his family and then worry about the law.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">That is why I am so adamant against gun registration and believe the second<br/>
amendment to the defense of our constitution.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I am today joining Oath Keepers as it is so important to spread the word and defend our Constitution.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">God bless America!</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Robert C. Ladnier:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Testimonial: I am a new member and retired U.S. Coast Guard, former Executive Security Specialist and Corporate Sec Mgr for Bi-Lo, Inc. a former Police Officer in South Carolina and currently a member of the N.T.R.T Team for Southern Nuclear at the Farley Plant in Dothan, Al. I have served either my Country or my communities for 30 years and will continue to do so as long as I am able to draw breath. I do strongly believe in the Oath Keeper movement and look forward to networking with fellow members both in Alabama and Nation wide.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I won’t bore fellow members with war stories of days long past, we all have them. But I will emphasize my desire and wish that we all take this program serious and work towards strength through unity.<br/>
Look forward to meeting you all.</p>
<p>R.C. Ladnier, Alabama</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Tim Wynne:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Testimonial: I took my Oath in Detroit in 1978 and have Honored it everyday since. My Oath is good until my last breath, which may be coming soon if we don’t take our country back from those who are supposed to be serving us, not attacking us.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">————————————————————————————————–</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Tim Rickman:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Testimonial: As a combat vet, I would not wish the experience on anyone, though I’m thankful for having been. It is there I got a clear perspective how the world works. Also, how deceitful our government can be. Serving in the first Persian gulf war, I saw first hand how the government twists the truth to make it seem like you are doing something noble. In reality it’s all about securing their corporate sponsors cash cow.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I swore an oath to the constitution. To protect the freedoms of our people. I’m one of those people. It’s my freedom too, and I’m not about to surrender it to the government after I bled to have it. The powers that be have over-stepped their bounds. For those service members who would think to stand with a corrupt government for any sake, remember one thing. It could be your family in the firing line.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">————————————————————————————————–</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Anonymous:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Testimonial: I…, do solemnly swear to support and defend the Constitution of the United States against ALL enemies foreign and domestic, and to bear to true faith and allegiance to the same. That I take this obligation freely, without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion, and to well and faithfully discharge the duties of the office I am about to enter. So help me God”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The same oath anyone who enters public office must take… unfortunately its now just a formality. I hate to say that we must stand up and fight…</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“And what country can preserve its liberties if their rulers are not warned from time to time that their people preserve the spirit of resistance? … The tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants.”<br/>
― Thomas Jefferson</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Jarrod Smith:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Testimonial: I Jarrod Smith, do solemnly swear that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same; that I take this obligation freely, without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion.</p>

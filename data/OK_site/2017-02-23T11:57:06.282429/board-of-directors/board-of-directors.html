<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>E. Stewart Rhodes – Founder and President</strong></p>
<p align="justify">Stewart is the founder and President of Oath Keepers. He was born in Fresno, CA and comes from a family of hard working migrant farm workers (of Mexican and Apache Indian decent) on his mother’s side, and hard working Midwest farmers, horsemen, and GM auto workers on his father’s side. Both sides of his family have a long tradition of military service. During WWII his Grandfather on his mother’s side was a B-17 ball turret belly gunner, and his Grandfather on his father’s side of the family served as an Army infantryman in the Battle of the Bulge. Nearly all of his uncles on both sides of the family served in the Army or Marine Corps during WWII, Korea, and Vietnam, and his father served as a Marine.</p>
<p align="justify">Following the family tradition, Stewart joined the Army straight out of high school at age eighteen, attending Basic, AIT and Jump School at Ft. Benning, GA and then serving as a paratrooper (11B1P Airborne Infantry) stationed first at Ft. Bragg, NC and then at Ft. Lewis, WA, where he served in a long range Airborne scout company for the 9th Infantry Division until disabled in a rough terrain parachuting accident during a night jump. (jump #36!)</p>
<p align="justify">After the Army, Stewart graduated Summa Cum Laude from the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, where his honor thesis focused on the political theory of James Madison. While attending UNLV, Stewart taught rape prevention and street crime survival as a volunteer instructor for the UNLV Jean Nidetch Women’s Center. He also worked as a professional sculptor and as a Nevada State certified concealed carry firearms instructor. After college he worked on Rep. Ron Paul’s (R, TX) DC staff.</p>
<p align="justify">Stewart graduated from Yale Law School in 2004, where his paper “Solving the Puzzle of Enemy Combatant Status” won Yale’s Judge William E. Miller Prize for best paper on the Bill of Rights. He assisted teaching U.S. military history at Yale’s History Department, was a Yale Research Scholar, and is now writing a book on the dangers of applying the laws of war to the American people (with partial support from a modest but gracious grant from Yale Law School). After law school he clerked for the Arizona Supreme Court and then served as a small town Montana criminal defense (including contract public defender) and general practice lawyer. He has served in a pro bono capacity on several gun rights cases before federal Courts of Appeal and the United States Supreme Court. While practicing law in Montana, he also served as a volunteer fire-fighter ( practicing what he preaches).</p>
<p align="justify">Stewart was invited to speak at Stanford University on unlawful enemy combatant status, and teaches classes on the Constitution and Bill of Rights. Stewart currently writes articles on the Bill of Rights for S.W.A.T. Magazine, and has written for The Warrior, the journal of Gerry Spence’s Trial Lawyer’s College; for www.moreliberty.org; and for Jews for the Preservation of Firearms Ownership (JPFO), and for his own Dirt Rhodes Scholar blog where he was an outspoken critic of Bush Administration violations of the Constitution (www.stewart-rhodes.blogspot.com).</p>
<p align="justify">After founding Oath Keepers, Stewart has appeared on dozens of nationally syndicated radio shows, on scores of local radio shows across the country, and has appeared on MSNBC’s Hardball with Chris Matthews, on Fox News’ The Factor with Bill O’Reilly, and on CNN Special Reports.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Maj. Rex H. McTyeire (Deceased), U.S. Army Special Forces,<br/>
Honorary Member of the National Board of Directors for Oath Keepers</strong></p>
<p align="justify">Major McTyeire started his military career from southern Georgia (Albany) as a volunteer, on orders to Jump School at eighteen years old. At Ft Benning, he was recruited into Special Forces, and offered an age waiver to volunteer. He was one of the youngest soldiers to graduate SF Phase 1 at Ft. Bragg in the period, and was on the Honor Detachment. Assignments to 5<sup>th</sup> 3<sup>rd </sup> 7<sup>th</sup> and 10<sup>th</sup> SF Group “A Teams” followed, as well as a tour with 46<sup>th</sup> Company SF Thailand. On the road to SFC E-7, as a master parachutist: Rex added Advanced Demolitions, Jump Master, Ranger and Scuba schools to his resume. He went from SFC to Lieutenant as an OCS Honor Graduate, after degrees from NY State University. Rex was a charter member of the Special Forces Officer Branch (“Crossed Arrows” brass) with 18 primary and three 35 series intelligence schools backing it up. After a series of nominative black Special Operations assignments, with a mission focus on Afghanistan, winning an MSM for service reporting on Soviet combat activity: Maj.

<p align="justify">Major McTyeire is a life member of the Special Forces Association, and has also been a member of American Mensa for 35 years. His degrees are all oriented to History, Military History, Archaeology and Anthropology, and he enjoys writing about anything in related fields: from paleoanthropology on to general Scottish history, and specific military engagements throughout history. He has produced research work on battles from Kadesh to Culloden, as well as the US Revolution. After retirement from Special Forces, Rex did security consulting and contract work in Azerbaijan, Romania and Turkey, and became very active in the Scottish Independence Movement.</p>
<p align="justify">Rex was the first American elected to the Scottish Independence Convention, and continued to actively support the voice of the people and freedom in Scotland. He works for the resident choice on the issue of Independence of the Scottish Nation, and a final end to Monarchy. He has been writing military history and general Scottish History on line for about 15 years, while blogging and running message boards in support of Scotland’s voice and options to her own future for 10 years. Rex brings to Oath Keepers a solemn commitment to the US Constitution, and avidly supports the rights and voice of all people everywhere.</p>

</a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong> Sheriff Richard Mack, Former Sheriff of Graham County, Arizona</strong></p>
<p align="justify">Author/speaker and former sheriff Richard Mack has served in a wide variety of roles over the course of his nearly twenty year career in law enforcement, which began in Provo, Utah.Mack began his career with the Provo Police Department as a parking enforcement cadet while attending BYU. A couple of years later he became a full-time officer and was soon promoted to Corporal, Sergeant, and Detective. His most traumatic experience there was a one-year assignment as an undercover narcotics agent. After nearly 11 years at Provo PD, Mack decided to return to his childhood turf in Arizona and run for Graham County Sheriff. His campaign took off and he was elected in 1988.</p>
<p align="justify">He was sheriff for two terms until 1997. He was named Elected Official of the Year by the Arizona-New Mexico Coalition of Counties in 1994, received the NRA Law Officer of the Year, inducted into the NRA Hall of Fame, 1995 Cicero Award, Samuel Adams Leadership Award from the Local Sovereignty Coalition, and Gun Owners of America Defender of the Second Amendment Award.</p>
<p align="justify">During his tenure, federal officers informed the sheriffs of the state that they would be required to enforce the so-called “Brady Bill” and run background checks at their expense under the law. In 1994, Mack and six other sheriffs from across the country, challenged the constitutionality of the Brady Bill and ultimately, fought it all the way to the United States Supreme Court, where they won a monumental decision for freedom.</p>
<p align="justify">Three years later, in a landmark 5-4 split decision based on the Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, Mack won his case.</p>
<p align="justify">A graduate of the FBI National Academy, some of Mack’s positions include: patrol officer, undercover narcotics officer, hostage negotiator, youth officer, school resource officer, communications supervisor, corporal, front desk sergeant, detective, sheriff, Search and Rescue supervisor, jail administrator, and DARE instructor.</p>
<p align="justify">Mack has been a consultant on numerous cases regarding police abuse, brutality, and other misconduct by public officials. He has joined with other members of the law enforcement community to speak out in favor of drug policy reform.</p>
<p align="justify">A graduate of Brigham Young University, Mack lives with his wife in Fredericksburg, Texas.</p>
<p align="justify">During the past two years Sheriff Mack has been a speaker at more than 70 different Tea Party rallies all across the country, ranging all the way from Honolulu to Bangor, Maine. Mack has supported this noble movement, because it is both effective and peaceful.</p>

<strong>Oath Keepers Merchandise</strong></p>
<p align="justify"><a name="shook"></a></p>
<p>James Nelson Ayala was born in New York and is named after his Grandfather, “Nelson James DeYoung”, who was a decorated member of the U.S. Navy being awarded the “Purple Heart” and “Bronze Star” during WWII. Jim lived in Minnesota for 8 years, then became a resident of Las Vegas, Nevada in 1972 and graduated Chaparral High School in 1981. He lettered in three sports including Football, Baseball and Wrestling. Attended two years at Clark County Community College in Las Vegas learning to be an Emergency Medical Technician (EMS #03577) and volunteering his work locally.</p>
<p>A long time small business owner, Jim created and co-owned a donut shop for five years in 1987. He then worked in construction and later became a certified Home Inspector in 1999, until present. Always an active member in the community, Jim was elected as a National Delegate for the State of Nevada and participated at the 2012 Republic National Convention in Tampa Florida.</p>
<p>Jim, as a vigorous supporter of our country, met Stewart Rhodes in Las Vegas during the 2007 Ron Paul presidential campaign. Their newly found friendship began talks that were spearheaded by Stewart, about creating a new organization dedicated to the Constitution called “Oath Keepers” in late 2008. Stewart wrote “Oath Keepers Declaration of Orders We Will NOT Obey” and asked Jim to create an introductory promotional video based on that declaration (<a href="https://youtu.be/Zztaj2AFiy8" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'https://youtu.be/Zztaj2AFiy8', 'https://youtu.be/Zztaj2AFiy8');" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/Zztaj2AFiy8</a>). Jim’s personal efforts in the beginning were instrumental in the success of Oath Keepers and included investing personal funds for its “start-up”.</p>
<p>Jim has performed various duties within the organization including video producer, membership coordinator, interim treasurer and manager of OK merchandise sales. He is currently a proud member of the Board of Directors as an Associate Member of Oath Keepers, membership #3. Jim has patriotic conviction and love of his country with a strong constitutional base and that is the foundation of his beliefs and goals that are the spirit of the “Oath”.</p>

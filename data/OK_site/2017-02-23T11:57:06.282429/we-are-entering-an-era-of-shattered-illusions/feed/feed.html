<content:encoded>APPLAUDING AND SALUTING YOU! It is so encouraging to see posts like this. Agree with you wholeheartedly. WE were asleep at the wheel and sadly chose not to pay attention for a long time. COMPLACENCY was our mantra. Glad to see that I am not alone in this assessment NOR in its solutions. LOCAL IS AS LOCAL DOES!!!  Fixing my own house first, and moving into the community as we speak.

<content:encoded>Superb comments and quotes.  You sir, understand things so many don’t.  Not all “founding fathers” wanted a constitution or even republic. Thomas Payne was my favorite and I also quote him extensively. Patrick Henry is a close second.  There is nothing recognizable in our current government from what these men envisioned.  The power grab and exploitation of our citizens began early, although there were enough patriots to delay the subsequent outcome that is with us today.  That struggle for freedom was dealt a devastating defeat in 1913 with the formation of the Federal Reserve and implementation of “income tax”.  Ron Paul clearly has been a champion in trying to make others aware of the significance and harm of the Federal Reserve and IRS to our basic freedoms and liberty.   The “globalists” have had over 100 years of virtually unchecked power to tighten the noose around our necks.  Now is the time to remove that noose from OUR necks and place the ropes around the necks of those that have enslaved us,  and intend to continue to use “our country” to expand their tyranny throughout the world.

<content:encoded>This is a very excellent and thought provoking article. Judging some of the previous comments I would have to say that Brandon’s writings are for deep thinkers with critical reasoning skills. Some of the commenters were obviously by products of government schools! ‘Nuff said there. I think 2015 is going to be a very telling year for all of us. Ruby Ridge &amp; Waco was my wake up call. I’ve been “eyes wide open” since then. I took the Red Pill a long time ago! I’ve often wondered why I survived Vietnam. I damn sure didn’t go there to fight for the kind of government we have now. God has a purpose for me. That’s the only explanation I have for being here. This government and economy will collapse. If I’m still here I will do my duty for God &amp; country. Airborne All The Way!

<content:encoded>I couldn’t agree more. The essence of freedom is “anarchy” which I would produce the absolute opposite of the chaos that is intentionally produced every day by our controllers.  Surely people must understand that we have been treated like abused children throughout our history (and that of the “civilized world” – time we accepted the responsibilities that should be demanded by adults and “govern” ourselves.  There is no alternative.  Every governing organization is or will become corrupted – it is the nature of power’s effect on human nature.  The bigger the governing organization, the greater the power and corruption.  Always has been that way, always will be.

Citing <a href="http://www.thenewamerican.com/tech/environment/item/19514-obama-signs-climate-deal-with-communist-dictator-gop-balks" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.thenewamerican.com/tech/environment/item/19514-obama-signs-climate-deal-with-communist-dictator-gop-balks', 'Obama’s pseudo-treaty with dictator Xi Jinping on “climate change” ');">Obama’s pseudo-treaty with dictator Xi Jinping on “climate change” </a>as a model approach, Soros expressed hope that Obama’s final year in office could be exploited to form the “strategic partnership” he envisions with Beijing.</p>

<p>Soros presents two basic false choices for America: Essentially capitulate to Beijing and form a “partnership” with the <a href="http://www.thenewamerican.com/world-news/asia/item/21025-china-staking-claim-in-the-new-world-order" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.thenewamerican.com/world-news/asia/item/21025-china-staking-claim-in-the-new-world-order', 'mass-murdering dictatorship');">mass-murdering dictatorship</a>, or face a World War against Communist China, Moscow, and other powers. “A strategic partnership between the U.S. and China could prevent the evolution of two power blocks that may be drawn into military conflict,” Soros speculated, summarizing the underpinnings of much of his argument. “Russian aggression needs to be firmly resisted; by contrast China needs to be encouraged — by offering a more constructive alternative — to avoid the route of military aggression.” A key point strategically omitted by Soros, of course, is that <a href="http://www.thenewamerican.com/economy/item/18462-russia-china-deals-another-nail-in-the-coffin-for-u-s-dollar" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.thenewamerican.com/economy/item/18462-russia-china-deals-another-nail-in-the-coffin-for-u-s-dollar', 'Beijing and Moscow are already very close allies');">Beijing and Moscow are already very close allies</a> — and have been since Stalin helped Mao enslave China, <a href="http://video.thenewamerican.com/world-news/video/christian-gomez-russia-victory-day-new-world-order" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://video.thenewamerican.com/world-news/video/christian-gomez-russia-victory-day-new-world-order', 'including during the phony “Sino-Soviet split” exposed as strategic deception by KGB defector Anatoliy Golitsyn');" target="_blank">including during the phony “Sino-Soviet split” exposed as strategic deception by KGB defector Anatoliy Golitsyn</a> and others.</p>
<p>While Soros’ latest comments may sound bizarre and outlandish in isolation, they become even more alarming when considered in the context of <a href="http://www.thenewamerican.com/economy/commentary/item/4006-george-soros-funded-by-the-house-of-rothschild" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.thenewamerican.com/economy/commentary/item/4006-george-soros-funded-by-the-house-of-rothschild', 'the Rothschild dynasty protégé’s');">the Rothschild dynasty protégé’s</a> previously expressed views on the role of Communist China in the emerging world order. Speaking to the<em> Financial Times</em> in 2009 about what Obama should discuss while in Beijing, Soros declared that the United States and the U.S. dollar were on their way down, and that the Communist Party regime must step up to the plate. “I think you really need to bring China into the creation of a new world order, financial world order,” he said. “I think you need a new world order, that China has to be part of the process of creating it and they have to buy in, they have to own it in the same way as the United States owns … the current order.” Let that sink in.</p>
<p>It was hardly a slip up. The next year, while receiving the Globalist of the Year award from the Canadian International Council, Soros again called for China’s participation in the emerging global-governance regime. “They have now got to accept responsibility for world order and the interests of other people as well,” he declared. In short, Soros foresees a giant role for the ruthless tyrants in Beijing in what he and numerous other globalist bigwigs have described as the “New World Order.”</p>
<p>In his latest screed, Soros reiterated those views, though not quite as bluntly. Complaining that instead of a “global order we have to speak of global disorder,” the hedge fund boss laments the fact that statist economist John Maynard Keynes’ proposed “truly international currency” ended up losing out to the U.S. dollar after World War II. He also claims, absurdly, that both the Democrat and Republican parties have “continued to emphasize American sovereignty” and “rarely agreed on subordinating it to international obligations.” The truth is almost the exact opposite, as the establishment wing of both parties have been working furiously to surrender U.S. sovereignty for generations to the UN, regional “free trade” schemes, NATO, and other globalist bureaucracies.</p>
<p>However, if Soros and his ilk, from Moscow and Beijing to London and D.C., end up getting their way, the global order they envision will soon be a reality. The <a href="http://www.thenewamerican.com/economy/economics/item/20833-imf-the-new-global-fed" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.thenewamerican.com/economy/economics/item/20833-imf-the-new-global-fed', 'dream of a “truly international currency” run by the International Monetary Fund');">dream of a “truly international currency” run by the International Monetary Fund</a>, too, will still ultimately come to fruition, and China’s barbaric Communist Party will have a major role and voice in the process, unless action is taken to stop it. In fact, in his latest essay, published on June 9, Soros articulated his desire to reduce the influence of the U.S. government and other Western powers at the IMF — <a href="http://www.thenewamerican.com/economy/economics/item/20833-imf-the-new-global-fed" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.thenewamerican.com/economy/economics/item/20833-imf-the-new-global-fed', 'now openly being groomed to take on the role of global central bank');">now openly being groomed to take on the role of global central bank</a> — and<a href="http://www.thenewamerican.com/economy/item/20223-imf-seeks-to-bypass-u-s-veto-in-bid-to-empower-self-tyrants" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.thenewamerican.com/economy/item/20223-imf-seeks-to-bypass-u-s-veto-in-bid-to-empower-self-tyrants', ' hand that influence to Beijing');"> hand that influence to Beijing</a>.</p>
<p>“[The IMF] has abandoned its commitment to the Washington Consensus but the controlling shareholders of the Bretton Woods institutions — the US, the UK, France, and Germany among them — are unwilling to relinquish their voting control by increasing the representation of the developing world,” Soros claimed, in defiance of the facts (Only the U.S. Congress is stopping it right now, as Obama and all other major powers are onboard). “This is very shortsighted on their part because it does not recognize changes in the relative weight of various economies and particularly the rise of China.”</p>
<p>Soros also touts in his essay the IMF’s proto-global currency known as Special Drawing Rights (SDRs), demanding that the Chinese yuan (RMB) be included in the basket of currencies that make it up. Of course, <a href="http://www.thenewamerican.com/economy/item/20223-imf-seeks-to-bypass-u-s-veto-in-bid-to-empower-self-tyrants" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.thenewamerican.com/economy/item/20223-imf-seeks-to-bypass-u-s-veto-in-bid-to-empower-self-tyrants', 'Putin and his Russian government have long pushed the exact same agenda');">Putin and his Russian government have long pushed the exact same agenda</a>, and Putin is one of the chief promoters of the “reforms” Soros touts, ironically, as a way to contain Moscow. The only obstacle standing in the way of those drastic reforms — <a href="http://www.thenewamerican.com/economy/item/19459-imf-boss-lobbies-u-s-congress-for-more-money-power" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.thenewamerican.com/economy/item/19459-imf-boss-lobbies-u-s-congress-for-more-money-power', 'doubling the funds of the IMF, expanding its powers, surrendering Western influence to Third World regimes, and more');">doubling the funds of the IMF, expanding its powers, surrendering Western influence to Third World regimes, and more</a> — are U.S. lawmakers. They are facing international globalist pressure to surrender U.S. leverage over the IMF to empower Beijing, Moscow, and other regimes, with IMF boss Christine Lagarde even offering to “belly dance.”</p>
<p>On the economy, Soros also willfully distorts the truth, framing the increasingly statist U.S. government as some sort of fervent promoter of free markets. “By allowing financial capital to move around freely the Washington Consensus also allowed capital to escape taxation and regulation,” the financier claimed. As Soros knows full well, however, the opposite is again closer to the truth, with the IRS demanding tribute from Americans and even green card holders no matter where in the world they live, invest, or work. Almost incredibly, Soros proceeds to lambaste his imaginary world where capital is free from taxation and regulation as “a triumph for market fundamentalism.” Again, the opposite is closer to the truth. He even credits former Federal Reserve boss Ben “Helicopter” Bernanke and his lawless and outlandish <a href="http://www.thenewamerican.com/economy/markets/item/4581-fed-manipulations-in-the-crosshairs" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.thenewamerican.com/economy/markets/item/4581-fed-manipulations-in-the-crosshairs', 'flooding of the global economy with trillions of new debt-based fiat dollars with allegedly saving the global economy from the fiasco the Federal Reserve played a key role in creating');">flooding of the global economy with trillions of new debt-based fiat dollars with allegedly saving the global economy from the fiasco the Federal Reserve played a key role in creating</a>.</p>
<p>On dealing with Beijing, Soros threatened the United States with the prospect of war if it does not support Beijing. The U.S. government, he warned, “could, of course, obstruct China’s progress, but that would be very dangerous.” “President Xi Jinping has taken personal responsibility for the economy and national security. If his market-oriented reforms [<a href="http://www.thenewamerican.com/world-news/asia/item/21026-chinese-tyranny-2-0" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.thenewamerican.com/world-news/asia/item/21026-chinese-tyranny-2-0', 'sic');">sic</a>] fail, he may foster some external conflicts to keep the country united and maintain himself in power,” Soros opined. “This could lead China to align itself with Russia not only <a href="http://www.thenewamerican.com/economy/item/18462-russia-china-deals-another-nail-in-the-coffin-for-u-s-dollar" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.thenewamerican.com/economy/item/18462-russia-china-deals-another-nail-in-the-coffin-for-u-s-dollar', 'financially');">financially</a> but also <a href="http://www.thenewamerican.com/world-news/south-america/item/18804-in-latin-america-russia-and-china-push-new-world-order" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.thenewamerican.com/world-news/south-america/item/18804-in-latin-america-russia-and-china-push-new-world-order', 'politically');">politically</a> and <a href="http://www.thenewamerican.com/world-news/asia/item/11144-russia-china-holding-joint-naval-war-games" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.thenewamerican.com/world-news/asia/item/11144-russia-china-holding-joint-naval-war-games', 'militarily');">militarily</a>. In that case, should the external conflict escalate into a military confrontation with an ally of the United States such as Japan, it is not an exaggeration to say that we would be on the threshold of a third world war.”</p>
<p>“Both the US and China have a vital interest in reaching an understanding because the alternative is so unpalatable,” Soros continued. “The benefits of an eventual agreement between China and the U.S. could be equally far-reaching. Recently there has been a real breakthrough on climate policy on a bilateral basis. By taking the nonbinding representations and promises made by the two countries [sic] at face value, the agreement has made more credible some recent efforts to bring climate change under control. If this approach could be extended to other aspects of energy policy and to the financial and economic spheres, the threat of a military alignment between China and Russia would be removed and the prospect of a global conflict would be greatly diminished. That is worth trying.”</p>
<p>Soros’ reference to <a href="http://www.thenewamerican.com/tech/environment/item/19514-obama-signs-climate-deal-with-communist-dictator-gop-balks" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.thenewamerican.com/tech/environment/item/19514-obama-signs-climate-deal-with-communist-dictator-gop-balks', 'the “agreement” forged by Obama and Xi should sound even more alarm bells');">the “agreement” forged by Obama and Xi should sound even more alarm bells</a> — especially because the Big Government-promoting financier cites it as an “approach” that could be “extended” to everything from energy to finance. That “climate” scheme between Obama and Xi, signed last November, was, first of all, never presented to Congress for approval, much less formal ratification by the Senate. Yet, in the deal, Obama, behaving more like a Third World despot than an American president, unilaterally “pledged” to slash the CO2 emissions of Americans by more than 25 percent from 2005 levels by 2025 — with all of the economic sacrifice and loss of liberty that would entail. The Communist dictator ruling China, meanwhile, who misrules the economy that produces the highest levels of carbon emissions worldwide, would be expected to force the Chinese people to stop “increasing” their CO2 output by 2030. A more ludicrous “agreement” would be hard to imagine.</p>
<p>To his credit, Soros does hint at the Beijing regime’s ruthless totalitarianism. “People have to walk within a grid; those who transgress the red lines may fall into the hands of the security apparatus and disappear without a trace,” he observed, speaking of the bounds within which Chinese — even those within the ruling hierarchy — must keep their opinions. However, contrast that sentiment with one expressed by Soros in 2010. “Today, China has … a better functioning government than the United States,” he said. Let that sink in, too.</p>
<p>As the Communist Chinese regime continues to brutally oppress the people of China while drastically expanding its influence over “global governance” with Western globalist support, Soros’ comments should serve as a wake-up call to the American people about where all of this is going. In a recent cover-story package, <em>The New American</em> magazine <a href="http://www.thenewamerican.com/world-news/asia/item/21025-china-staking-claim-in-the-new-world-order" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.thenewamerican.com/world-news/asia/item/21025-china-staking-claim-in-the-new-world-order', 'exposed Beijing’s Western-backed takeover of key United Nations agencies and other globalist institutions, along with its creation of numerous other tentacles adding to the emerging “global governance” regime');">exposed Beijing’s Western-backed takeover of key United Nations agencies and other globalist institutions, along with its creation of numerous other tentacles adding to the emerging “global governance” regime</a>. The two-part series also <a href="http://www.thenewamerican.com/world-news/asia/item/21026-chinese-tyranny-2-0" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.thenewamerican.com/world-news/asia/item/21026-chinese-tyranny-2-0', 'exposed the Chinese dictatorship’s ongoing and savage tyranny');">exposed the Chinese dictatorship’s ongoing and savage tyranny</a>.</p>
<p>The scheme advanced by Soros to have the United States form a “strategic partnership” with the autocracy responsible for murdering more human beings than any other entity in human history should be laughed out of the room — along with<a href="http://www.thenewamerican.com/world-news/asia/item/19697-trans-pacific-partnership-to-facilitate-u-s-china-merger" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.thenewamerican.com/world-news/asia/item/19697-trans-pacific-partnership-to-facilitate-u-s-china-merger', ' the equally ridiculous argument');"> the equally ridiculous argument</a> by globalist “conservatives” that crushing U.S. sovereignty and self-government with the <a href="http://www.thenewamerican.com/world-news/asia/item/20761-chinese-diplomat-tpp-ftaap-compatible-complement-each-other" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.thenewamerican.com/world-news/asia/item/20761-chinese-diplomat-tpp-ftaap-compatible-complement-each-other', 'Beijing-backed Trans-Pacific Partnership');">Beijing-backed Trans-Pacific Partnership</a> (TPP) will help “contain” Beijing. Unfortunately, though, unless the American people get educated on the growing threat, the globalist manipulation of public opinion could eventually see such grotesque ideas become reality.</p>

<p><em><strong>[Editor’s Note:  By phone conference Wednesday, April 15, 2015, various Board members and Stewart Rhodes took reports from Joseph Rice who is the coordinator for Josephine County Oath Keepers in Oregon. Joseph Rice has done an outstanding job in furnishing and organizing security to the mines involved in this most-recent gambit by the BLM (Bureau of Land Management, another rogue Federal agency which is being used to probe the American people and wrest State ownership of public lands within State boundaries from We The People).  Joseph Rice has a good working relationship with the Sheriff of Josephine County, and he lamented to the Board that the Sheriff is now reporting “death threats” (plural) are being made against the life of the Deputy mentioned in the article below.</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>Oath Keepers Founder and President, Stewart Rhodes, has asked me to make clear to all Oath Keepers everywhere that Oath Keepers will not tolerate any member who makes death threats. Period. According to Josephine County Sheriff, these threats are being investigated now.<br/>
</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>I feel confident that the death threats against the Deputy have not come from any dues-paying member of Oath Keepers, but I want to point out that no one who dares to make a death threat against anyone (and certainly a Deputy) can remain a member in Oath Keepers, and indeed will be banned from membership for life. We will not tolerate that. </strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>I understand the logic in many reactions to this Deputy having made his now infamous statement, and it is obvious to me that the SPLC’s training programs for “law-enforcement officers” has its fingerprints all over the poor Deputy’s brain. What he has said is a clear example of the sort of training our cops and Deputies are receiving now that America is being converted into a police state. They are being taught that the Constitution and the people who uphold it are “problems” for law enforcement. While that is in itself a travesty and constitutes what amounts to treason, it is not the mission of Oath Keepers to call for the death of any officer who succumbs to the current training programs and devolves his humanity to the point he allows himself to be a tool of governmental tyranny. Brainwashed cops/Deputies/soldiers are not the problem — they are the symptom of the problem.  Oath Keepers sets a high bar for standards of deportment to qualify for membership in our organization. All Oath Keepers are expected to remain calm and cool in their mind sets.</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>Thank you,</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>Salute!</strong></em></p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">— BLM Contract Deputy Sheriff Jason Stanton</h2>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Story by Shorty Dawkins, Oath Keepers Associate Editor</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">While serving a BLM Stop Order upon the Sugar Pine Mine, BLM Contract Deputy Jason Stanton, when told by the parties involved that they were ‘Constitutional people’, Deputy Stanton replied, <em>“I have issues with the Constitution.”</em> Below are two sworn affidavits from two witnesses to the exchange.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Issues with the Constitution? Really? Deputy Stanton, you swore an oath to defend the Constitution against all enemies, both foreign and domestic. If you had “issues” with the Constitution, then why did you swear an oath to defend it? Are you saying your oath is meaningless? By extension, are you announcing you have no intention of honoring your sworn oath? If so, then you should be honorable enough to resign from your position of trust.  At the very least, the Sheriff of Josephine County, your superior, should give you some instruction on your duties, and the meaning of your Oath. You took the oath, which says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“I, (NAME), do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same”</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">What issues do you have, Deputy Stanton? The people of Josephine County deserve to know if you will abide by your sworn oath. They need to know if the “issues” you mentioned will prevent you from doing your lawful duty as a Deputy.</p>
<p> </p>

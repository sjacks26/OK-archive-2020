<content:encoded>Ladies and Gentlemen<br/>
I have found the best opportunity to assess the community and their responses is to get everyone involved. I have started them with the SALUTE Reports. I will type them out for brevity.<br/>
S) =Size<br/>
A) Activity<br/>
L) Location<br/>
U) Unit/Uniforn<br/>
T) Time and Date<br/>
E) Equipment<br/>
As the head of S2 I have my phone number and email address on a copy of that SALUTE report so that all of your members can call it in. I sometimes receive SALUTE reports on low flying aircraft from the time they enter our county until the time they leave knowing airspeed, height and direction of travel as well as description.. The one thing that this does is allows everyone to be an asset and prepare them for SHTF delivery by whatever means available and the ability to observe and write what they see. It also lets me ask if anyone has formal training and if they would like to be on the S2 team. It is an easy button to get started with.<br/>

<content:encoded>I don’t know anything about military tactics or assessing threat levels, but I do recognize pomposity and hubris.

<content:encoded>Sam the article is primary for entry level civilians who will fill rank and file members.  We advance from where you left off.  It is important not to be overwhelming in mass detail.  Well written.  Stay well stay safe!

<content:encoded>Great article. I am a Viet Nam Vet. and have been a member for a couple of years. I have contacted Oath Keepers several time hopeing to make contact with others in my area (Palm Springs, CA.) but have never received a return response. I also have Oath Keepers decals on my truck and have explained numerous time to civilians what Oath Keepers is all about, and proudly I might say. I can’t be the only Oath Keeper in this whole valley. If TSHTF in Los Angeles the population will pour out of the LA basin and run right over us in the Desert communities. We really need a Community Response Team here. in the Coachella Valley.

<content:encoded>Different strokes for different folks. I started at Holidird  back in the day Sam. There and every formal occupational field school attended they always begin  with a broad brush overview of the art form, concept and areas of interest. The nuts and bolts followed.  I don’t disagree with the thrust of your  topic. I just disagree with its level.  Since this blivet appears to be the first of a series I’d of started with the need for an organized command structure and the importance of intelligence in the decision cycle. You built from there.  Sun Tzu leads the way.  Max Sez

GS: We have to make a document, how we handle the border. Do we open? Maybe we have passports, maybe we let some people go. Show a little bit.

SR: So they tried to reform a little bit.

GS: This colonel, later he spoke on TV. He said what should I do, we were discussing, the only way was open the border. There was no way around it. The party would never do this. He wrote a document that said we have to open the border, everyone can go freely over the border. He said I’ve heard this because I had no idea, I wrote this document. There was no way. I know the party will shutter this. But the party did not realize everything changed. The party just signed this.

SR: So he wrote it up and the party approved it.

GS: Like the healthcare bill here. No one read it. The party was pretty sure, this guy, just sign it. They did not even read it.

SR: So he tricked them

GS: He expected they will shutter this. I write down what I think but they will shutter it. What should I do? The secretary of Berlin, of the party, there was a little rally. He said now we have a document. He read and the microphone, he stopped, and said wait, open the border.

SR: He didn’t know what it said until he started reading it?

GS: He did not know why. It was completely unexpected. He just read it. So it was completely a misunderstanding. The colonel and his team said there is no way to do anything. We make nothing or write down what I think. They will shutter this and we can do anything. I have no way to do something else. The party got this, thought it’s time now, because the rally was already there in Berlin. Okay, just in time, sign it. The secretary of the party in Berlin got this, he was already talking to the people, saying nothing. He got the document, was happy because he didn’t have to make a decision, the party did one. And he read and stopped at that point, then said open the border. Half hour later, everyone was at the border.

SR: That’s funny. So they thought they were gonna have some kind of, maybe a few people can go, some moderate reform. But then.

GS: Bide some time.

SR: But the colonel took advantage of that, wrote out what he really thought, and they signed it like idiots.

GS: He said on TV I just wrote it down because I have no idea what I should do. For me it was pretty clear, they will put it in the shredder, I will get in trouble. Then we have trouble on the street.

SR: He thought they would throw it away.

GS: (0:03:53.9) Absolutely. He did a good job just on time. They were under time pressure because of the rally in Berlin. 

SR: So an accident like that. Now it would have happened eventually anyway. It would have been more trouble.

GS: More trouble, maybe 2, 3 days more.

SR: A fortunate accident of history. What happened to the secret police? How come they didn’t go out and arrest people and shoot people?

GS: That was funny. The head attorney in the army, he asked me I need your story. Will you support me? I said what are you going to do? I will get those guys, from the part of the secret police in the army. They had to control the army too.

SR: Stasi was everywhere right?

GS: I said okay, we will do this. I wrote down the story. He tried to let them arrest the guys from the Stasi. The boss shot himself.

SR: Oh they were going to arrest the Stasi? Ah.

GS: Others had been arrested, prosecuted, some just fired. It was a long process.

SR: What kind of government, when it all fell apart and the party lost its power, what did they do? What kind of government came in?

GS: It was a funny government. There was no opposition, no party that could take over. Most who came in charge were from the church. Even some artists, a lot of scientists. Then it was easier, because of the support from W Germany.

SR: Right the wall fell down, you had a reunification. But what happened? The military didn’t try to run the country.

GS: No. The military was still there. But the secretary of defense resigned. He was replaced by a priest. I left the army, I was required the leave the army after I got back from my arrest. It was when the party was still in charge. I could only leave the army at the end of November. I was still in the army then.

SR: But you were on your way out.

GS: (0:06:57.7) Then, in December, I was out of the army.

SR: This was December 89.

GS: Yes. Oh no, today we will not do anything. We will strike. Sit there and do nothing. 

SR: What day was this?

GS: It was in December 89. Shortly after the new guy took the army over. The priest.

SR: So the army went on strike?

GS: Yep. They were sitting on tanks, nice weather, doing nothing.

SR: Why?

GS: Just. Just they don’t want. We don’t need an army anymore, the border is open. Some requirements. The funny thing was the commander in chief, the priest came, please soldiers, please go back to work. You cannot do this. (0:08:12.0) I went to my boss, he was still in the army, I said what is going on in this army. Don’t ask me, he says. I said are you in the church or in the army now? It was an oppression army, it changed, I cannot believe it. The party was out. They tried to take it over, they put some of their guys in position to not lose anything, but it was over. The reunion was one year later.

SR: Did you go over to W Germany when they put the wall down? In 89? What month was that? October 89?

GS: It was November 7.

SR: Oh the anniversary right. That’s ironic.

GS: The wall came down November 9, two days later. 

SR: The timespan, from beginning of the rally. When did they start?

GS: In the same year, 89, in January.

SR: So in the span from January to November

GS: Everything crashed down

SR: It was a steady build up of people marching. Then it was 2 day event. The army said no. They told them to go crush the protestors, they said no we’re going to stay on the base, and they had no power. All the power was gone.

GS: 2 days later, the wall was gone.

SR: All the secret police just faded away, tried to hide.

GS: Yes, right.

SR: Before that they were feared.

GS: They tried. The part of the secret police in the army tried to change to the army to get documents saying they were army officers, not anything like this. All this happened in this time, it was chaotic.

SR: They tried to deny they were ever secret police.

GS: Never never. I never did anything

SR: Like an SS guy taking off his stuff, oh I’m just an average German soldier. Same kind of thing. Now tell us about what happened in Romania. That was going on at the same time, right?

GS: Romania was in the same time. Romania was completely different than Germany. Ceaușescu had complete power. He took children away from families. Boys became his children, trained from the beginning to be in his party. He killed a lot of Gypsies. Romania was completely difficult.

SR: So far worse.

GS: Yes. The secret police was far worse in Romania. Finally they killed Ceaușescu and his wife.

SR: It was a very fast revolution there too. 10 days.

GS: It was later, after Germany. The Stasi from Germany put a lot of documents, they moved it to Romania. In the hope that Ceaușescu would stay. He was really a dictator, not like us. Czech, Poland, Hungary, all tried it before. Romania never. It was really in his hand. So he was a partner of our party in E Germany. He took all the documents, as much as they could, to Romania. Even part of my documents, so part is still there. They collected it by the Stasi. It was really brutal. They just killed him and his wife. Maybe it’s the only way. Because his security was still behind him.

SR: In that situation, it started with a priest who was going to be arrested and deported. The neighbors would not give him up to the secret police, that was the beginning of the rebellion. 10 days later, the dictator was dead. The military in that situation did the same thing. They refused to fire on the people. They stood down and he was powerless. 

GS: The army had no choice. They were isolated. All other countries were completely different. The only complete dictatorship left at this time was Romania. It was the last.

SR: (0:13:13.4) Did the people there feel the same that you had? After a certain point, 80%, 90% agreed this was wrong?

GS: That’s because the economy in Romania was the worst in all of E Europe. The people had nothing to eat. I crossed Romania sometimes for vacation. Never seen this. Absolutely poor. 

SR: Like North Korea today.

GS: Yes. Similar like this.

SR: He held on to power as long as he had support from other countries and Russia.

GS: But the people realized all the rest of E Europe changed.

SR: Okay. Any last thoughts you want to tell us? Now that you’re here in America, what do you think about America and what’s going on? Why did you join OK?

GS: I join OK because I know a soldier has to follow his oath, everyone who took an oath should follow it.

SR: Here the oath is to defend the constitution in this country as well

GS: Yes. This constitution is the best ever written in human history. If you don’t defend the Constitution, it’s a worthless piece of paper. Nothing else.

SR: Right.

GS: A constitution like this will never be rewritten. It’s the only one and will remain the only one. If you don’t defend the Constitution, it’s gone, America is gone. I have no idea what happens then. Things get worse. We will not get a second America. This is the one chance, keep it or lose it.

SR: What’s your message to the military in America?

GS: Read the Constitution and think about their oath.

SR: They should do at least as well as you did in the E German military.

GS: Absolutely. You took an oath to the Constitution, read it, stay to it.

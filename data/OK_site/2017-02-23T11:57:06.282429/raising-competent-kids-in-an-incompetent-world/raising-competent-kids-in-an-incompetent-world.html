<p>It’s probably no surprise that the young people of today aren’t particularly independent.  Not only does <a href="http://www.thedailysheeple.com/setting-the-stage-for-tyranny-public-schools-deliberately-create-a-culture-of-fear_042014" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.thedailysheeple.com/setting-the-stage-for-tyranny-public-schools-deliberately-create-a-culture-of-fear_042014', 'the “education” system take great pains to mold them');" target="_blank">the “education” system take great pains to mold them</a> into follow-the-herd, terrified automatons, society in general doesn’t force them to do much for themselves either.</p>
<p>My oldest daughter recently came home for summer vacation and we    discussed her first year of college.  She told me that her younger    sister, age 13, was much more mature and competent than many of the kids    in her student apartment building.  “I had to show a bunch of them  how   to do laundry and they didn’t even know how to make a box of Kraft    Macaroni and Cheese,” she said.</p>
<p>Apparently they were in awe of her  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Man-Meets-Stove-cookbook-microwave/dp/0985570806/ref=as_li_tf_sw?&amp;linkCode=wsw&amp;tag=permacultucom-20" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.amazon.com/Man-Meets-Stove-cookbook-microwave/dp/0985570806/ref=as_li_tf_sw?&amp;linkCode=wsw&amp;tag=permacultucom-20', 'ability to cook actual food');" target="_blank">ability to cook actual food</a> that did not originate in a pouch or box,  her skills at changing a   tire, her knack for making coffee using a  French press instead of a   coffee maker, and her ease at operating a  washing machine and clothes   dryer.  She says that even though she  thought I was being mean at the   time I began making her do things for  herself, she’s now glad that she   possesses those skills.  Hers was also<a href="http://www.theorganicprepper.ca/dorm-room-preppers-the-next-generation-of-survivalism-07022013" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.theorganicprepper.ca/dorm-room-preppers-the-next-generation-of-survivalism-07022013', ' the apartment that had everything needed to solve everyday problems');" target="_blank"> the apartment that had everything needed to solve everyday problems</a>: basic tools, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Adventure-Medical-Kits-First-Aid/dp/B002K66484/ref=as_li_tf_sw?&amp;linkCode=wsw&amp;tag=permacultucom-20" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.amazon.com/Adventure-Medical-Kits-First-Aid/dp/B002K66484/ref=as_li_tf_sw?&amp;linkCode=wsw&amp;tag=permacultucom-20', 'first aid supplies');" target="_blank">first aid supplies</a>, OTC medicine, and <span class="IL_AD" id="IL_AD1">home remedies</span>.</p>
<p>This got me thinking about how life will be when disaster eventually strikes.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a>If  the country is populated by a bunch of people who  can’t even cook a   box of macaroni and cheese when their stoves function  at optimum   efficiency, how on earth will they sustain themselves when  they have to   not only acquire their food, but must use off-grid methods  to prepare   it? How can someone who requires an <span class="IL_AD" id="IL_AD2">instruction manual</span> to operate a  digital thermostat hope to keep warm when their home   environment it  controlled by wood they have collected and fires they   have lit with it?</p>
<p>Of course, the above is a particularly dire  scenario.  Let’s look at   some less dramatic, but more likely,  situations. This isn’t even about   prepping, per se, but <a href="http://www.amazon.com/YOU-Enhanced-Edition-Insiders-Healthier-ebook/dp/B00G2AQ7G8/ref=as_li_tf_sw?&amp;linkCode=wsw&amp;tag=permacultucom-20" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.amazon.com/YOU-Enhanced-Edition-Insiders-Healthier-ebook/dp/B00G2AQ7G8/ref=as_li_tf_sw?&amp;linkCode=wsw&amp;tag=permacultucom-20', 'about life skills');" target="_blank">about life skills</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Job Loss</strong></p>
<p>In the current economy it might not even be as cut and dried as job  loss – the new generation <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Making-Living-Without-Job-revised/dp/0553386603/ref=as_li_tf_sw?&amp;linkCode=wsw&amp;tag=permacultucom-20" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.amazon.com/Making-Living-Without-Job-revised/dp/0553386603/ref=as_li_tf_sw?&amp;linkCode=wsw&amp;tag=permacultucom-20', 'may never find work at all');" target="_blank">may never find work at all</a>.    When you have  little-to-no money, cost-cutting efforts in order to   get by requires  certain skills and adaptations to stay fed and clean.    Your kids need to  know how to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cook inexpensive, nutritious meals from scratch using pantry basics.</li>
<li>Do laundry by hand and hang it to dry.</li>
<li>Get from point A to point B using public transit or under their own power.</li>
<li>Budget limited money so that the most important things are paid first.</li>
<li>Mend and repair items instead of replacing them.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Power Outage Due to Natural Disaster</strong></p>
<p>We’ve all seen the aftermath of hurricanes, tornadoes, blizzards, and superstorms.  Your kids should be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Keep warm, whether that means safely operating an indoor    propane heater, using the woodstove/fireplace, or bundling up in a tent    and sleeping bags in the living room.</li>
<li>Keep fed – they should have enough supplies on hand that they can    stay fed at home for up to two weeks: cereal, powdered milk, granola    bars, canned fruit, etc.</li>
<li>Keep safe – they need to understand it is dangerous to go out and    about during situations like this and they need to have basic self    defense and weapons-handling skills. As well, they need to understand    the dangers of off-grid heating and cooking, such as the risk of carbon    monoxide poisoning in unventilated rooms.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Illness and Injury</strong></p>
<p>This can happen anywhere  at any time.  Keeping a cool head when  someone  is ill or injured is  the absolute most important step towards a  good  outcome. My kids both  took babysitting courses and First Aid  courses to  further their  money-making abilities as young teens, but the  skills  learned their go  much further than bandaging a toddler’s scraped  knee.   Kids should:</p>
<ul>
<li>Take a course in First Aid, CPR, and anything else applicable that    is offered.  The more you know, the calmer you are able to remain  during   a crisis.</li>
<li>Have a good basic First Aid kit and know how to use everything in it.</li>
<li>Know some home remedies for various common illnesses: teas for tummy    aches, treatment for flu symptoms, how to soothe skin irritations,  and   how to care for a fever.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Automotive Safety</strong></p>
<p>An astonishing number of  young adults don’t know how to drive. Back   when I was a kid, the most  exciting thing in my teenage life was getting   behind the wheel of a  car, getting a learner’s permit when I was   fourteen, and having that  permit turn into a real driver’s license on my   16th birthday.</p>
<p>Now, many kids could care less if they ever learn how  to drive.    Instead, they rely on public transit or friends and family  members who   drive.  It’s one thing if you live in a major metropolitan  area, but   in places with lower populations, it seems that this is a  vital skill.    In order to transport yourself to work and school, or to  help out in   the event of an emergency, it seems to me that kids should  know how  to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Drive.  Not only an automatic transmission, but also a standard transmission.</li>
<li>Change a tire.  You don’t want your teenage daughter stranded on the    side of the road at the mercy of whomever stops to help. My daughter    was not allowed to drive the car until she demonstrated her ability to    change the tire with the factory jack.</li>
<li>Perform minor maintenance, like checking oil and fluid levels,    filling up the washer fluid, checking tire pressures and topping them up    if needed, and changing the windshield wiper blades.  I have a    background in the automotive industry, so I also taught my daughter how    to change the oil, which is nice to know, but not absolutely  necessary.<strong>And finally, what about day-to-day life skills?</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>I was truly surprised when my daughter told me about the lack of  life   skills her friends have.  I always thought maybe I was secretly  lazy   and that was the basis on my insistence that my girls be able to  fend   for themselves, but it honestly prepares them for life far better  than   if I was a hands-on mom that did absolutely everything for them.   They   need to realize that clothing does not get worn and then neatly  reappear   on a hanger in the closet, ready to be worn again. They need  to   understand that meals do not magically appear on the table,  created by   singing appliances ala <em>Beauty and the Beast</em>.</p>
<p>Here are some of the life skills that kids should have gained before leaving the nest:</p>
<ul>
<li>How to use basic tools for repairs.</li>
<li>How to cook a healthy meal.</li>
<li>How to grocery shop within a budget and have healthy food for the week ahead.</li>
<li>Speaking of that, how to budget in general, so that they don’t have “too much month and not enough money.”</li>
<li>How to clean.</li>
<li>How to do laundry, including stain removal.</li>
<li>How to think for themselves and question authority.</li>
<li>How to manage their time to get necessary tasks accomplished by the deadlines.</li>
<li>How to tell the difference between a want and a need.</li>
<li>How to be frugal with utilities and consumable goods.</li>
<li>How to pay bills.</li>
<li>How to stay out of debt (not easy with the college credit card    racket that you see on campuses across the country and rampant student    loans).</li>
</ul>
<p>The more they practice these things under your watchful eye, the more    competent they will be when they set out on their own.  We all want  our   kids to be successful and independent. Don’t allow them to become    crippled by a world that babies them in the name of convenience.</p>

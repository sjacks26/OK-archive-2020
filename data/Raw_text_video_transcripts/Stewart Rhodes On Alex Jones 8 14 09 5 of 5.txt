## Alex Jones; Stewart Rhodes; John in Missouri

AJ: Let’s talk to John in Missouri.

John: It’s good to talk to 2 great American patriots. Keep up the great work, keep pressing. 1 point to make to all patriots. If they do press this issue and push the button, all patriots need to know who the enemy is so they can be singled out in the future so they can do their job. Know who the people in CFR are. Know who the people in high command who have been acting treasonously against our government are. So when you get the opportunity for making a citizen’s arrest or somewhat different approach, they can know what their true enemy is.

AJ: Well they wanted to attack Iran, but Fox Fallon said no. There are even some good people at the higher levels.

Voiceover: Big brother. Mainstream media. Government cover ups. You want answers? Well so does he. He’s Alex Jones, on the GCN radio network.

AJ: SR, isn’t that the big issue, what the last caller was bringing up, that the establishment is playing a very dangerous game? They want to stir up resistance, but only enough to label it kooky and to demonize peaceful demonstrating and voting and litigation. They want enough of a revolt to crack down but not a big enough revolt where it’s seen as widespread then they lose. I don’t want to give them the violent revolt, but I don’t know if the establishment knows, I think they do to a certain extent, there really are probably about a million people that really don’t want to live anymore and just want to go after globalists. You see the White House apologizing, Senators apologizing, saying we know you’re mainstream, we know a lot of you are Democrats that don’t want health care or cap and trade. We’re sorry. There’s a total capitulation happening. I think this may be them breaking and deciding not to go with a very hot summer and fall. I’m not saying that’s happened. But I think they’re starting to realize this isn’t going to be as easy as what they did to the Russian people.

SR: (0:02:41.2) No, cause we’re not Russian or Chinese or Cambodian peasants. This is America, we have a long history of fighting back against any kind of tyrant. So they have their work cut out for them. But they’re still trying the same playbook, which is to demonize, marginalize, and chill speech. They’re threatening you with arrest because they want you to stop speaking out. That’s the modus operandi. I get emails all the time saying I’m afraid to join OK, I don’t want to be on a list. All this DHS and SPLC stuff, it does work on some people because it chills their speech. [garbled]

AJ: I don’t see that working anymore. More and more people say I don’t care. Look the answer is they have 20 million, 100 million on the list.

SR: Precisely

AJ: Folks, I’m on the top of the list, right up there with Ron Paul. Good, I’m at the top of the list. That’s why John Hancock said look, I’m signing my death warrant if we don’t win this thing, I’m gonna sign this big and bold so I’m the number 1 guy they try to come after.

SR: That’s right. As I said on Lexington Green, the answer is to add 300 names to that list, put us all on it. That is the proper response, and I think it’s going to happen. Folks, don’t let them chill your speech. If you think you’re going to be able to be quietly the grey man and the mole and sit back and not make waves, that you’re going to be okay, you’re kidding yourself. Look back at history, look at the gulags in Russia. Half the guys in gulags were writing Stalin saying I don’t understand why I’m here, there must be some mistake. There was no mistake, you were there for a damn good reason. Don’t think being quiet is going to keep you safe. You need to step up right now and speak up. Use 1A before you have to use 2A.

AJ: Exactly, the only way to beat these people is to stand up to the bullies. That’s what Alexander Solzhenitsyn said, to paraphrase, oh how we burned in the camps. That when Stalin would send out his secret police arresting people every night, that we didn’t wait for them with our daggers and our hatchets. Literally folks, you cross over to a point spiritually, mentally, historically, that you’re part of a species. Liberty and freedom for the human condition is what matters, not letting control freaks and criminals and back stabbers and parasites run things. I look at it this way, politically, not physically, but if need be. The Alamo, Travis knew he was going to die, he said victory in death, he felt good about it. It wasn’t that he was some madman, this was the chance of a lifetime to stand up to a bunch of thugs. He knew that his blood was going to water the tree of liberty. I don’t know what people are afraid of. This is the real chance to fight for the republic when it’s really under attack, when they’re coming for your family. SR, closing comment.

SR: We’re going to die anyway. Use your voice first. But I’m not afraid to die, I’m going to die anyway. None of us gets out of here alive and what counts is that our children are free. That’s all that counts. It’s time to use your voice, the pen is mightier than the sword, use your pen, speak out, and join OK.

AJ: Okay SR. We’re going to get behind you on that fundraiser, and our listeners. I’m just the gateway to these great people. God bless you we’ll talk to you as that approaches.

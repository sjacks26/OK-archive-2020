BR: We’ve heard it said, modern technology makes resistance to tyranny impossible. Drones often presented as the end game for free people. Drones are effective because of observation capabilities, mainly thermal vision (0:00:56.1). Without it, they are no more dangerous than any other weapon. According to thermal vision promoters, body heat is almost impossible to hide. We’re gonna show proof that this claim isn’t true. Our motto is low-tech beats high-tech. (0:01:24.3)

BR: After considerable testing, we have developed a thermal cloak, called the ThermTac Ghost Suit. This suit can be worn long term and can reduce body heat signature by 90% or more.

## FLIR video shows two figures walking by. Camera pans back to a triangular shape, which is a person using the suit. Essentially no coloration due to heat shown on the FLIR, until the person takes off the suit.

## BR comes back and explains how to build the suit around 0:06:06.2

BR: (0:12:08.3) Thermal tech isn’t magic. A lone person in woods can easily evade thermal vision. Eric Frein in PA proved this, whether you think he’s guilty or not. (0:12:33.9) Frein evaded police for weeks, who searched via helicopters and men on the ground. If your goal is just to hide from thermal, there’s many things you can do. If your goal is to advance on an objective or to move in a group or move your family, you will need some kind of thermal cloak (0:13:10.0). If you’re moving between observation posts, comms posts, and security posts, it may be a good idea for you to wear a thermal cloak. If you’re under thermal surveillance, that will help prevent prying eyes from seeing where those posts are and what your routines are.

## Video cuts to BR in a tactical vest with an AR-style rifle (0:13:30.3). He demonstrates the cloak over his essential kit. It’s effective in normal vision. The cloak is also effective against FLIR, mostly. When firing a weapon from a standing position, body heat is mostly reduced relative to non-cloaked, but nowhere near enough to actually be effective while firing a weapon. It does much better from crouched and from prone.

Video caption: We are currently working on thermal rifle covers as well (0:15:25.3)

## Video seems to try to demonstrate that the cloak can be used while engaging targets with a weapon. For example, one clip shows a cloaked figure advancing while firing a rifle. This seems crazy to me. Why use thermal cloak while engaging in a moving firefight? I guess it’s just trying to prove a point.

BR: We expect a few criticisms from releasing info about the suit. The first is that we might be helping “the terrorists” (0:17:37.1) fighting against our soldiers or infiltrate our security. Most terrorists, as documents released about ISIS show, are trained by our own covert agencies. They’re well aware of these tactics. Second criticism: we’ll be helping illegal immigrants cross into the US by helping them hide from Border Patrol thermal. (0:18:39.2). But illegal immigrants are crossing nonstop anyway. Third criticism: no reason for the American people in general to have this capability, why would they need it? With drone tech and the widespread use of thermal, and the widespread of corruption of government, I would say why not? The American people have the right to defend themselves against any enemy, foreign and domestic.

BR: This was a joint project between OK and alt-market.com (0:19:56.8). OK helped provide materials and the thermal scope to test the suit, as well as input of multiple OK members. Suit has been tested with military-grade thermal technology.

BR: The suit plan is free. We’re also selling professionally made suits, made here in Montana, through Snakebite Tactical.

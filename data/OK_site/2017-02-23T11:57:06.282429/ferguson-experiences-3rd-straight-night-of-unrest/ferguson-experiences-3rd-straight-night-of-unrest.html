<p>By ALEX SANZ and JIM SALTER</p>
<p><span>FERGUSON, Mo.</span> — Authorities  arrested three protesters during a third straight night of unrest in  Ferguson as tensions mount amid speculation that a grand jury could  decide soon whether to indict the police officer who killed Michael  Brown.</p>
<p>St. Louis County police said large groups of protesters  blocked traffic three times in the St. Louis suburb Friday night. That  happened twice near the police station and once on West Florissant  Avenue, the site of violent protests soon after Brown’s death. A  motorist lost control and crashed into a light pole during the unrest on  West Florissant. Protesters converged on the car, but no one was hurt.</p>
<p>Police  spokesman Brian Schellman said three demonstrators were arrested on  charges of unlawful assembly after remaining in the street after  repeated requests to move.</p>
<p>Ferguson is on edge as a grand jury weighs whether to indict Ferguson  Officer Darren Wilson, who killed Brown, 18, during a violent  confrontation on Aug. 9. The white officer’s killing of the unarmed  black 18-year-old led to protests, some of which turned violent.</p>
<p>Wilson,  28, reportedly told the grand jury that he feared for his life as  Brown, who was 6-foot-4 and nearly 300 pounds, came at him. Some  witnesses said Brown was trying to surrender and had his hands up.</p>
<p>St.  Louis County Prosecutor Bob McCulloch has said the grand jury decision  will be announced this month. His spokesman, Ed Magee, told reporters at  around noon on Friday that the grand jury was still in session. Five  hours later, though, Magee declined to say whether the panel was still  meeting. He did not respond to messages seeking comment Saturday.</p>
<p>The time, date and place for a news conference announcing the decision has not been decided, Magee said.</p>
<p>The size and intensity of protests had dwindled until recently.  Arrests have been made three straight nights, mostly for protesters  blocking streets.</p>
<p>Calls for peace and restraint emanated from  several quarters, including President Barack Obama, Attorney General  Eric Holder and civil-rights leaders and business owners.</p>
<p>The most emotional appeal came from Brown’s father, Michael Brown Sr.</p>
<p>“Hurting  others or destroying property is not the answer,” Brown said in the  video released by the group STL Forward. “No matter what the grand jury  decides, I don’t want my son’s death to be in vain. I want it to lead to  incredible change, positive change, change that makes the St. Louis  region better for everyone.”</p>

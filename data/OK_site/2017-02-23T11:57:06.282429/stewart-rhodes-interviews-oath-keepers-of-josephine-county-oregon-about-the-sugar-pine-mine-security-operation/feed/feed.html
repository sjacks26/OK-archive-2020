<content:encoded>So who you are advocating blowing up and killing with your drone? The ladies making lunch, their children, babies in strollers like Janet Reno did in Waco Texas, dedicated selfless Patriot servicemen and women, retired fire fighters, retired law enforcement officers, the neighborhood volunteers? Do you intend to “blow them up”, “or do you intend to burn them alive like Bill Clinton did?”<br/>
Please “DO NOT answer here”. Now I know full well that low-information LibTards are genetically and mentally incapable of following meaningful instructions, but please “DO NOT answer here”. Please,.. with your awesome brains and brawn, you seriously need to deliver your answer on “WHO YOU INTEND TO KILL AND BURN ALIVE WITH YOUR DRONE”, “personally” to the Oath Keepers at the Sugar Pine mine camp. As God is my witness, you must trust me, when I say to you that there is “no single person on earth that the Oath Keepers want to listen to up close and personal, more than a mental microbe defect like you. And they are waiting ever so patiently for you to arrive as soon as you possibly can.

<content:encoded>Awesome interview.  I have been to the Staging Area several times now with members of the Linn-Benton County, Oregon OK Chapter members helping out making lunch and cleaning up the kitchen area. We live 2 1/2 hours from there. We have met so many great American Patriots from all over this nation that have the same goals of all of us and that is to save this nation and preserve our Constitution.  Thank you to all who have and are still guarding the mine.  you are all awesome…back there tomorrow to take supplies and make lunch….

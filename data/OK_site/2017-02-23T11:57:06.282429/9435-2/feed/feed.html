<content:encoded>You’re obviously not the brightest diamond in the cluster. As a matter of fact, it’s evident you’re a far cry from the cluster. You keyboard wanna-be commando.

<content:encoded>Blah, blah, blah. Have any of you arm-chair patriots taken a look at the TOE of a Stryker Brigade? There is enough firepower at Ft. Lewis, WA to take out every damn “militia” in the country without breaking a sweat and without the help of the Air Force and Marines. Don’t think for one minute that they won’t fire on American citizens if ordered to do so. It’s happened before and, if necessary, will happen again.
<p>Mr. and Mrs. Average American looks at you and sees not patriots, but rather Meal Team 6 in cammo, playing at Army. Nobody who is not already a member of your seditious network is going to support you in any effort you make to “take back” the country. There are plenty of recently retired soldiers who would be more than happy to have the righteous opportunity to shoot your sorry asses.</p>

<content:encoded>Don’t be fooled, those FBI agents want to kill Ammon Bundy and friends. What many here have not realized is that negotiation with the Federal Government and its representatives is a pipe dream. Ask anyone who has ever entered into a treaty with the same. Tyrants and their obsequious boot licking representatives, like these FBI agents,  have no conscience, therefore, reasoning with them is futile. They will obey orders like automatons. There is no peaceful resolution to this. It falls one of two ways and already has gone their way to a certain extent, the Hammonds being unjustly jailed under double jeopardy. Bundy and friends are next. The thugs in the FBI, BLM, and Military Special Ops should be told in no uncertain terms to leave or be forced to leave. Those low-lives don’t even deserve a hand-shake from us because they are oath violating scum bags.

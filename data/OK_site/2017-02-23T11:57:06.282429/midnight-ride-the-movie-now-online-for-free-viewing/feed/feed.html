<content:encoded>Watching the video now. Thank you. Sent notices to other sites mentioning the existence of and link to the video. My suggestion; to maximize public viewing and aware of the very short attention span of the majority perhaps a series of brief snippets that convey part of the messages/warnings conveyed within the entire video.
<p>These can be sent to many places across the Web to assist in warning We, the People of what I, and others, believe is growing tyranny within the USA that requires a firm response by the masses of us being tyrannized.</p>

<content:encoded>I recall one event where a local government (Seattle WA, Jan 27, 2013) ran out of gift cards and began handing out IOU’s, after which a makeshift gun show erupted with buyers making offers to buy with hard cash to the people in line , in lieu of accepting the IOUs.   Another incident, Feb 21, 2013, Santa Fe NM promising an anonymous buyback event, also ran out of gift cards, handed out IOU’s, and then publicly released the gun owners names.

<content:encoded>Dan, If your father is no longer an irresponsible alcoholic and has mended his ways, then there should be no reason why he couldn’t regain his right to bear arms and exercise his right to self defense, if need be. Even with a CWP, a DUI will get your permit suspended for at least 5 years, till you can re-apply. You understand the gravity of alcohol and firearms. Thing is, you know your Dad, and he seems to have changed by what you say… Since his DUI’s didn’t hurt anyone else (I will assume), then why not. If this were our neighborhood, and we took a vote on it, I would say most, if not all, would give YOUR Dad a second chance. That’s my professional, investigative thoughts.

<content:encoded>I keep hearing ” we all have a constitutional right to bear firearms”.  But how is that true when my father who had gotten 3 dui’s 83 93 and 2008 and can not own a firearm because he went to prison for 8 mo. and is now  a felon.  He has no prior criminal  history other than the 3 dui’s but this will make him unable to bear arms for the rest of his life.   We can’t even hunt together anymore even on our own land.<br/>
My fathers also is  a nurse and goes to church  so he’s not some waste away type .
<p>Thank you</p>

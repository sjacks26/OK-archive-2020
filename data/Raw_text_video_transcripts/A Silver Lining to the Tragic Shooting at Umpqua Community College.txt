JVT: New legislation in Oregon passed in Coos County that lets Sheriff prohibit local enforcement of state and federal gun laws (0:00:47.5) that any police officer deems unconstitutional. Rob is a political activist. Tom is DirOps of Oregon III%. Tom, tell us about why you got involved.

TM: Senate bill 941 presented in Salem, was a complete registration scheme for gun owners in Oregon. Ridiculous rules to be able to purchase a firearm: extended background checks. Violates our 2nd amendment, “to not be molested by government stooges if we want to own and carry firearms” (0:02:03.3). Oregon Constitution also protects gun ownership rights. We presented a 1 page resolution to Coos County Commission, 2 out of 3 commissioners voted against it.

RT: We gave the resolution in Feb, before the SB941 background check bill (0:02:40.6). We knew it was coming, commissioners knew it was coming. 2 commissioners refused to vote on anything that had to do with something that wasn’t a law yet. When SB941, we went back, with a 6-page ordinance instead of a 1-page resolution, containing punitive damages. 2 same commissioners – including one self-proclaimed conservative Republican – refused to pass the ordinance. They wouldn’t even come to the meeting, snubbed gun owners in the country.

TM: They were the ones who proposed the meeting (0:04:20.3) but failed to show. The next day, SB941 passed, making our ordinance moot.

JVT: Tom, you were in law enforcement. Talk about the importance of this.

TM: All LEOs take an oath to protect Constitution. State Constitution requires that. (0:05:02.8) Officers confronted with a crime must decide if it’s a constitutional law you’re going to enforce. For instance, 4th amendment, LEO has to go with the scope of the search. Every officer has to gauge the constitutionality of a law he’s going to enforce.
## Seems like TM is conflating following laws and judicial decisions about constitutional rights with making decisions about constitutional rights directly. I’m not expressing this clearly, but there’s a difference between following guidelines for search warrants to make sure you don’t violate the Constitution and deciding whether a particular law in question is constitutional.
TM: It’s an everyday aspect of the job. You practically have to be an attorney. If people don’t know their rights, how do they know they aren’t being violated right now? (0:05:56.3). Any attack on the Bill of Rights is tyrannical. The World Newspaper, an avid 1st amendment believer, tells us to ignore the 2nd amendment.

JVT: We had the shooting in Oregon last month. Became polarized, President tried to push gun restrictions, every opportunity the administration gets, they’re trying to take our 2A rights. (0:06:52.4) Timing seems just perfect, obviously you couldn’t plan it. I was there in town, helping to guard some of the families’ funerals, we got to sit down with the sheriff.

TM: Background checks have nothing to do with these shootings happenings. (0:07:35.1) The only thing that could have prevented that bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun.

RT: We started the petition drive several months before the shooting. We didn’t imagine this could happen, but it did. Reporters asked me what effect the shooting would have on our efforts, I said with Obama likely trying executive action, it would encourage voters to get out and support us. (0:08:26.4) Several people from other counties want to enact similar measures.

JVT: Your county sheriff Craig Zaney [sp?] initially seemed to support your effort, but he seems to back away from that (0:09:10.5).

RT: Most sheriffs in rural counties, their budget has been severely cut because the fed government has taken our land, almost half of our county is owned by the state or federal government. We have a diminished tax base. Sheriff funds his department through grants from ATF, DoInterior, etc. He can’t go out politically against state or federal law because he’s so dependent on their money, even though he’s guaranteed us that he will not enforce SB 941.

JVT: How important is it for groups like III% and OK to be involved law-making process at local level? (0:10:55.4)

TM: “It’s beyond extremely important.” The people need to use their voice, it’s our duty as American citizens to protect the Constitution. It’s everything we are in this country, it’s why we are in this country. “Aside from the Bible itself, it’s the greatest civil rights document ever written, ever graced the earth.” (0:11:20.1) The tyrannical people in our government, they hate the Constitution, but they use it, the 5th Amendment particularly.

JVT: We’ve come to a Rubicon. There’s so much going against our way of life, so many losses of rights. Tell us about your motivation.

RT: I encourage people all the time to get out there and do something (0:12:20.0). I come from NM, where we do not have initiative referenda. We can’t stop bad laws or create good laws. I tell people in Oregon all the time that they aren’t using this initiative process. I tell people I created a sanctuary county for gun owners just like Portland created a sanctuary city for illegal aliens (0:13:14.6). We stopped the largest wetland restoration project on the west coast via referendum. People do have the power, just have to use it. (0:14:18.1)

RT: Thanks for voting for the bill. Stay tuned for more initiatives, about our 4th, 5th, and 6th Amendment rights. People need to wake up.

JVT: We’ve got to all work together as the Liberty Movement, come together no matter what group we’re in. (0:15:43.3)

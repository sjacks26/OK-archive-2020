SR: OK is a non-partisan. When we say non-partisan, we mean it. I don’t care whether they’re a Democrat or a Republic. If they violate their oath, which they all took to support and defend the Constitution, I will call them on it. And you should too.

TH1: Right now, the Bush people are bringing out their mission accomplished sign because they’ve not only gotten Obama to protect Bush, Cheney, and others from any criminal investigation on torture. He’s now gone even further than they did in the protection of unlawful surveillance. This is the ultimate victory for the Bush officials. They have Barack Obama adopting the same extremist arguments and in fact exceeding the extremist arguments made by President Bush. (0:00:52.4)

## There’s a terrifying picture of a Bush/Obama hybrid. Someone spent time on this.

TH1: The old boss is starting to look a lot like the new boss.

KO: During his run for the presidency, BO, who taught constitutional law at the University of Chicago, argued against the Bush admin use of executive authority, including its self-justification, its rationalization, of the warrantless wiretapping of American citizens. That was then, this is now. President Obama’s Justice Department now not just defending Bush officials from lawsuits surrounding NSA domestic spying, but seeking to expand the government’s authority by making it immune from any legal challenge regarding wiretapping, ever. Welcome to change you cannot believe in.

## Montage of pictures of OK speakers.

SR: (0:01:48.2) We know that if a day should come in this country when a full-blown dictatorship will come, or tyranny, from the left or from the right, we know it can only happen if those men, our brothers in arms, go along and comply with unconstitutional, unlawful orders.

RM: (0:02:08.2) You took an oath of office to uphold and defend, preserve, protect, and obey the US Constitution. If we had law enforcement in America that were doing that, keeping their oath to do just that, we would have our constitutional republic back tomorrow. That’s how powerful this movement is.

AJ: (0:02:31.4) Finishing up with SR. Let me tell everybody how they’re going to attack what you’re doing. It’s with fear.

LD: Another controversial report and more damage control from DHS. The same department that issued a report suggesting returning war veterans were susceptible to extremist groups. Also issuing what it calls the domestic extremism lexicon.

UM1: If we all do nothing more than fulfill our oath, then we can turn things around just on that alone.

RM: Let’s just follow the Constitution. That’s my message, it’s been my message for 20 years, and it’s the OK message. Just keep your oath of office, follow the Constitution.

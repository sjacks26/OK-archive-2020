<p><strong>Jerry Hagen:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Testimonial: When I joined the Marines in 1983 at the age of 17 I took the oath for the first time. After my enlistment was done I spent a short amount of time as a Deputy Sheriff, again taking the oath. Deciding that being a copper wasn’t really for me I joined the Army and didn’t look back- 19 years later I retired with 23 years.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I’ve taken and retaken the oath many times, each time I extended. I’ve been deployed as both a Marine and a Soldier, the last being to Iraq. The thing is, each time I took the oath I paid close attention-because I meant every word of it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Now that I’m a lowly civilian, I see more and more the erosion of our rights, our very way of life. I dedicated my life to the preservation of what our nation is supposed to be for my wife, my kids and now my grand kids. I watch as the liberals/progressives/communists advance, everyday chipping away at our constitution. Sadly, I also saw how anyone that cried out against it was marginalized as a “kook” or “gun-nut” , or “paranoid”. I’m guilty of that too. I<br/>
bought into the government story of what happened at Ruby Ridge. No more.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I’m very happy to have found Oath Keepers. It gives me hope that there is an organized group of people willing to fight back. I want to live to be a grouchy old man, yelling at the neighborhood kids to get off my lawn but if it comes down to it my wife and kids know that I will stand and fight, because I have accepted the burden of protecting our Constitution and way of life. Always remember- we have 3 boxes from which to protect our great nation: The Soapbox, the Ballot Box and the Cartridge Box. We may well be approaching #3. Stay Strong and Be Brave.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Sgtlee89:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Testimonial: I am grateful to be part of an organization like this. Like minded people who really care about our country and our Constitution.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Times are changing quickly, and not for the better. I will be here if and when needed. I will stand with all of you.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Thanks to all of you for YOUR service.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Chief Joe:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Testimonial: My family has served the US Navy for over 70 years, add to that another 24 in the Air Force and 8 in the Army. We are a proud family of veterans and patriots. Each of us who are still alive and well, from my father (retired Master Chief) to my cousin (retired Chief) and myself (retired Chief) proudly served and would again if called.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Round Man:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Testimonial: I took the Oath to protect and defend the Constitution against all enemies both foreign and domestic. I have never said or signed anything to release me from that oath.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I meant it then and I still take it to heart.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I take this new Oath now to NEVER DISARM and I mean that. Molon Labe, from time to time the tree of liberty must be fed, etc etc. I will stand alone or with fellow Oath Keepers as needed to maintain American Freedom.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>James Shore:</strong></p>
<p>Testimonial: I support this great republic and the ideals it was founded upon, not the schemes of elitists who wish to attain power through subversion and usurpation.</p>
<p>I will not be a pawn of tyranny. I make this promise on this day, and all the days to follow.</p>
<p>-James</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="https://www.oathkeepers.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/PKato.jpg"><img alt="PKato" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5781" height="300" src="https://www.oathkeepers.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/PKato.jpg" width="400"/></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>PKato:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Testimonial: My oath initially taken in September of 1980 gave me tremendous pride that I had not felt at any point in the previous 18 years of my life. It was like coming home to family after a long absence. Being part of something bigger and more important than me as an individual was something I had looked for throughout my life to that point. While others around me talked about a job, money for school, travel, job skill, etc. I just thought of serving my country and being proud to do it no matter what was asked of me. I believed in the country, believed in the ideals set forth in the constitution, and was so happy to repeat the oath…it gave me a lump in my throat and a great sense of pride that was only exceeded when my only child was born. I cannot ever forget these two days, because those were two of the most memorable of my life.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Chris Metzger:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Testimonial: I, Chris Metzger, do solemnly swear that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United Sates and the State of Minnesota against all enemies foreign and domestic, that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same; that I take this obligation freely, without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion; and that I will well and faithfully discharge the duties of the office upon which I am about to enter. So help me God.</p>

<content:encoded>Ali,<br/>
Thank you for your encouraging comment here, and thank you for reading my work.<br/>
I recently bought my copy of Classified Woman by Sibel Edmonds, and have appreciated her work since shortly after 9/11/2001.<br/>
I began to awaken about the same time you did, apparently, getting a computer online in 1999. We always must remember — it’s not our government, it’s the criminals who have worked their way into seats of our governmental offices and titles. The American people now must boot those criminals out, demand transparency and accountability, and keep an ever-vigilant eye on the activities of all our supposedly “representative” officials. Thankfully, people like you, who question authority now, are growing in numbers, thanks to the Internet.<br/>
You keep the faith, okay? I’ll do so too. We’ll get our America back, and its governance in the hands of the people.<br/>
Salute!<br/>

<content:encoded>Cal, thank you for reading and studying. I hope more Americans remember to read more, to learn more, to see more clearly. Knowledge is power, and right now the American people need to be empowered, yes? .<br/>
Salute!<br/>
Elias

<content:encoded>Thank you, Bro; and, Welcome Home!<br/>
We’re waking up in droves across America, and I welcome you to the new awareness. There is nothing wrong with our Constitution and the form of government it created, but in the past fifty years or more our government has been taken over by special interests and criminal types who have totally violated their Oaths. We are not anti-government, but as Veterans who served and came back home to later learn we had been deceived, we now find that we must fight for America once again, this time against “enemies from within”. Our fight now is “mental”, for we must awaken our good neighbors to the corruption which has swallowed up Washington D.C.<br/>
Thank you sincerely for reading and leaving your comment here.<br/>
Semper Fi!<br/>
Salute!<br/>

<content:encoded>Over the last fourteen years I have slowly cultivated a deep resentment and suspicion against our  government, 9/11 being an eye opener for me; Classified Woman and Ameritopia helping as well. I want to thank you, Mr Alias, for taking the time to share such a well written and well thought out article with us. I wish it was at the top of Google’s search but I found it. Might I add that I had other plans for today but once I stumbled onto this treasure, I was hard pressed to put my phone down. Thank you again. And PS, I also find readers’ comments very helpful. Thanks to all of you.

<h1>Ammon Bundy – Malheur Wildlife Refuge Case</h1>
<h2>01.28.2016 – AMMON’S STATEMENT (not a transcript)</h2>
<p>My message still remains. Turn yourselves in and do not use physical force. Use the national platform we have to continue to defend liberty through our constitutional rights in an Article 3 Court with an Article 3 judge.</p>
<p>America must understand where we are at. We must make a choice now between freedom or force. Are we going to live free?</p>
<p>I will not abandon all that we have accomplished in the name of liberty for the sake of my own personal freedom. We must choose the path of liberty which comes with freedom of choice. People must not be okay with what is going on.</p>
<p>I am committed to freedom not force. Freedom not force. We are done with the culture of force. We are done with the government pointing guns at us to enforce their will upon the people. This is not liberty. This is not America.</p>
<p>As much as I desire to see my own babies and my wife and to be the loving husband and caring father for my six children, and to be home with them caring for their needs and holding them in my arms, I must not desire this at the cost of freedom. I want to make sure the American people understand that we have a duty in our situation to further the defense of our God given rights.<br/>
The world is listening. We will use the criminal discovery process to obtain information and government records. We will continue to educate the American people of the injustices that are taking place. We can do this through an Article 3 Court in front of an Article 3 judge. This is the Constitution. And it is ours to use and we will use it.<br/>
When we were detained, we were traveling to Grant County to educate those people of their individual rights. We were prepared with computers, PA systems and projectors. We have been branded as armed occupiers. But for weeks we have spent endless hours visiting the people in Harney County and surrounding counties presenting to them solutions and choices for them to make. We were being very successful in educating people and getting them to move towards freedom. At the time that we were gaining momentum through education. For this the government once again chose force that turned lethal.</p>
<p>We only had guns for our protection and never once pointed them at another individual or had any desire to do so. The people have a right to bear arms for their own protection. We never wanted bloodshed. We verbalized this many, many times and we continue to do so.<br/>
I mourn Lavoy’s death. Lavoy was a man who put other’s needs and safety before his own. After we were arrested, the FBI agents that transported us said that Lavoy’s shooting would have been recorded on video. We are anxiously waiting to review this video. Questions must be answered.</p>
<p>The choice is ours. Are we going to stand for freedom or are we going to fall by force.</p>
<h2>Statement by Lisa Bundy, Ammon’s Wife– 1/28/2016</h2>
<p>Lisa made a statement (<a href="http://arnoldlawfirm.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/lisa-bundy-ammon-bundy-oregon.m4a" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://arnoldlawfirm.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/lisa-bundy-ammon-bundy-oregon.m4a', 'audio M4A');" target="_blank">audio M4A</a>) ay asking those remaining at the refuge to please go home.She has heard from Ammon and agrees.</p>
<p><strong>FULL TEXT:</strong></p>
<p><strong>This is Lisa Bundy, Ammon Bundy’s wife. I spoke with Ammon’s lawyers yesterday and heard from his voice that those were his instructions: he wants people to go home; to go to their families.</strong></p>
<p><strong>STATEMENT BY AMMON BUNDY – 1/27/2016</strong></p>
<p><strong>First I want to address my beloved friend Lavoy Finnicum. Lavoy is one of the greatest men and greatest patriots I have ever seen. His love for this country ran deep through the blood he gave yesterday. And I mourn for him and his family. I’m praying for you fervently in every prayer. </strong></p>
<p><strong>We will have more to say later but right now I am asking the federal government to allow the people at the refuge to go home without being prosecuted. </strong></p>
<p><strong>To those remaining at the refuge, I love you. Let us take this fight from here.  Please stand down. Go home and hug your families. This fight is ours for now in the courts. Please go home.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Being in the system, we are going to take this opportunity to answer the questions on Art. 1, Section 8, Cause 17 of the United States Constitution regarding rights of statehood and the limits on federal property ownership.  Thank you and god bless America.</strong></p>
<p><strong>END OF STATEMENT</strong></p>

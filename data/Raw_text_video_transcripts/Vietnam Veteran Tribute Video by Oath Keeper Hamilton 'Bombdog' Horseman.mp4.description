Very moving tribute video that Vietnam combat veteran Hamilton "Bombdog" Horseman, 9th Infantry Division, sent in along with his testimonial to Oath Keepers (http://oathkeepers.blogspot.com).

His Testimonial:

How can I help?  I am just sick with the direction that MY nation is taking... My grand Father and Father and myself have all given blood in battle for our Nation. I served two tours 66'67'68' with The 9th inf. division. I am also 100% disabled from injuries of that conflict.

To see politicos who have no idea or had any family who served this country now in charge is a crime.
I feel like I do not have any representation in this government.   I have watched the socialist agenda carried on during my lifetime, starting with taking God or any concept of God out of everything.
This is a travesty.
Respect
Hamilton "Bombdog" Horseman

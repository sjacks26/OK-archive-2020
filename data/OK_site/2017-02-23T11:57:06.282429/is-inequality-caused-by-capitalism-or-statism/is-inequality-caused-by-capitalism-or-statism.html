<p><em>This article was written by John Browne and originally published at <a href="http://www.europac.net/commentaries/inequality_caused_capitalism_or_statism" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.europac.net/commentaries/inequality_caused_capitalism_or_statism', 'Europac.net');">Europac.net</a></em></p>
<p>The French economist Thomas Piketty has achieved  worldwide fame by  promoting a thesis that capitalism is the cause of  growing economic  inequality. Unfortunately, he is partially right.  However, the  important distinction missed by Piketty and all of his  supporters is  that state capitalism, not free market capitalism, has  reigned supreme  in recent decades in the world’s leading democracies. It  is this  misguided attempt to wed the power of the state to the private   ownership of capital that has led to the mushrooming of economic   inequality. If the public cannot be made aware of the distinction, we   risk abandoning the only system capable of creating real improvements   for the vast majority of people.</p>
<p class="CSSBody">In his book entitled ‘Capital in the 21st  Century’,  Piketty, like Karl Marx in ‘Das Kapital,’ places the hinge of  economic  tension at the supposed opposition between the competing  interest of  labor and capital. He believes that “capitalism  automatically generates  arbitrary and unsustainable inequalities that  radically undermine the  meritocratic values on which democratic  societies are based.” However,  this can only become true if free markets  become controlled, or  distorted, by the establishment of monopolies, be  they private or state  owned.</p>
<p class="CSSBody">In the early twentieth century, U.S.  Governments  were alert to the destruction of free markets by  monopolistic cartels  and enacted strong anti-trust laws to curb their  power. The United  States thereafter achieved strong economic results in  the first three  decades of the 20th Century. In contrast, the socialist  governments of  post WWII Britain used public funds to establish state  owned  monopolies, similar to those existing in the Soviet Union. This   resulted in dramatic economic declines, that continued into the 1980s   when the U.K. was rescued by the free market policies of Margaret   Thatcher. Her central strategy was to restore individual freedom by   breaking state owned monopolies and reducing the coercive control of   trade unions. Her actions unleashed a resurgence of prosperity in   Britain that was imitated in many other countries. Her policies were   adopted with particular enthusiasm by countries, like Poland, which had   only recently shaken off the yoke of Soviet Communism. Poland is now  one  of the strongest economies in Europe.</p>
<p class="CSSBody">History provides ample evidence that when  allowed to  function properly free market capitalism generates massive  national  prosperity with high employment, a strong currency and rising  standards  of living. It is only when the state manipulates and over  regulates  free markets that capitalism fails. However, capitalism  usually takes  the blame for the failures of statism.</p>
<p class="CSSBody">Piketty asserts that capitalism is  “inherently  unstable because it concentrates wealth and income  progressively over  time, leaving behind an impoverished majority. …”  He proscribes even  an international wealth tax and higher income taxes,  above 80 percent,  to redistribute rather than to invest savings. This  would essentially  create a state monopoly on wealth. But again, history  tends to  demonstrate that state monopolies create poverty for all but  the  politically connected elite.</p>
<p class="CSSBody">Even the Soviet Union, a military superpower,  was  brought to its economic knees by state monopolies. Communist Party   Secretaries, Andrapov and Gorbachev, were forced to the recognition that   free markets should be introduced within Russia. This led to   ‘Perestroika’ and ‘Glasnost’ and the freeing of markets in Russia.</p>
<p class="CSSBody">By concluding that capitalism, even if it is   confined to just a few countries, will lead to increasing poverty among   the masses around the world, many cynical observers may conclude that   Piketty is laying out a carefully planned case towards global socialism   along the lines first attempted by the Bolshevik Commintern. Some   conclude that such a move could be spearheaded by international   institutions like the UN and IMF.</p>
<p class="CSSBody">To achieve inherently unpopular global power,   national elites must cooperate to bring about such levels of economic   chaos and human suffering that people, despairing of ineffective   democracy, will look for strong, global government as a welcome   solution. To achieve this end the economic problems and human suffering   must be extreme and seemingly beyond solution by any national   government. By continuing to debase and destroy fiat currencies while   preventing the markets from healing themselves, central banks around the   world are doing their part to create these conditions.</p>
<p class="CSSBody">However, those who look towards strong global   government must realize that likely it will lead to a world of extreme   global inequality in which any effective opposition will be impossible.   This is the fascistic face behind the cuddly and concerned image that   has made Piketty the economic North Star of a new generation. These   faulty bearings must be corrected or the world’s poor will suffer far   more than they need to.</p>

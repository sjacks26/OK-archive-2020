<h2><strong>Ben Swann Exclusive: Called “domestic terrorists” by the feds, Oath Keepers help stop Ferguson from burning</strong></h2>
<p>By Joshua Cook  *  November 30, 2014</p>
<p>–</p>
<p><strong>You might have seen them</strong> on the news. The people protecting Ferguson businesses from the arsonists and looters ransacking Ferguson, Mo. But here is the real story about the organization protecting those businesses. They’re called Oath Keepers, and they have ex-police and ex-military keeping guard of four Ferguson businesses since late Monday night, Nov. 24, at the permission of the business owners.</p>
<p>They’ve been shown in the media before, but the report was incorrect, according to Stewart Rhodes, national founder of president of the Oath Keepers, who stressed that the group is not just business owners.</p>
<p>“We are not.  We are military and police veterans who are volunteer security for local businesses.  We have Iraq and Afghanistan combat vets in the rooftops, along with retired cops, guarding the shops,” he said.</p>
<p>The four businesses include Natalie’s Cakes and More, a bakery that was featured on Fox News, a beauty supply store, a dentist’s office and a Chinese restaurant.</p>
<p>In addition to their work keeping businesses safe, and the people living there, the group has also seen some totally bizarre interactions by the federal government and the state highway patrol.</p>
<p>According to Rhodes, “We had an alarming incident that happened last night with our team spotting what looked like a fed three-man sniper team moving into a nearby house on higher ground, and then pointing their rifles at our team of American combat veterans, while our team was guarding the buildings against looters.”</p>
<p>Rhodes said the team even observed the state highway patrol snipers deploy onto the roof of a nearby fire hall and point rifles at them.</p>
<p>“Our team leader called Unified Command to find out what was going on and then local police responded,” he explained.</p>
<p>He said that the local police were unaware of what the federal government were doing and that there was no coordination. “The local police are on our side and expressed gratitude for us being there, but the Feds are trying to run us out.”</p>

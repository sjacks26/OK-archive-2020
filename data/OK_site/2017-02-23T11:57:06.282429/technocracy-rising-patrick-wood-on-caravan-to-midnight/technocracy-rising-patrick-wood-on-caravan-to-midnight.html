<p>Patrick Wood has been in the trenches fighting for America for many years. He was co-author with the late Antony C. Sutton of the two-volume classic, “Trilaterals Over Washington”. His original “August Review” has morphed into the August Forecast. He speaks at events, such as the upcoming <a href="http://www.arizonafreedomfest.com/Arizona_FreedomFest/Speakers/Entries/2015/5/1_Patrick_Wood.html" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.arizonafreedomfest.com/Arizona_FreedomFest/Speakers/Entries/2015/5/1_Patrick_Wood.html', 'Arizona Freedom Fest');" target="_blank"><strong>Arizona Freedom Fest</strong></a>.

<p>This video is three and a half hours in length. Below the video are some points of interest for readers who are reluctant to start into a film that long.  I hope that the text below will influence motivated readers to make time to enjoy seeing Patrick Wood and John B.

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Super-revelations from Patrick Wood.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">In late March, 2015, John B. Wells of Caravan To Midnight hosted for three and a half hours a man who is America’s foremost researcher on the Trilateral Commission. Many in the Liberty movement already know that Patrick Wood co-authored with Antony C. Sutton the now-famous “Trilaterals Over Washington” (in two volumes). Personally, I began to follow Patrick Wood about ten years ago when I discovered at his website a fascinating article he had written about the Bank for International Settlements. I began subscribing to his newsletter, and that is how I received notice that Patrick Wood was interviewed by John B. Wells.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">From his interview with John B. Wells I have taken down a few notes to share with readers here. Mr. Wood’s latest book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Technocracy-Rising-Trojan-Global-Transformation/dp/0986373907/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1427778408&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=technocracy+rising+the+trojan+horse+of+global+transformation" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.amazon.com/Technocracy-Rising-Trojan-Global-Transformation/dp/0986373907/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1427778408&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=technocracy+rising+the+trojan+horse+of+global+transformation', 'Technocracy Rising');" target="_blank"><strong>Technocracy Rising</strong></a>, is packed with facts and information, and its contents are the focus in this video interview. The interview gets started early by discussion of the Trilateral Commission’s employment of Technocracy’s principles and their “<em><strong>New International Economic Order</strong></em>”, with mention of the Trilateral Commission’s goal of “<strong><em>transforming government</em></strong>”. By about 24 minutes into the video we see that more than just government is being transformed. Wood lists seven of their primary targets as being:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>1. Economics</strong><br/>
<strong>2. Government</strong><br/>
<strong>3. Religion</strong><br/>
<strong>4. Law</strong><br/>
<strong>5. Energy</strong><br/>
<strong>6. Humanity</strong><br/>
<strong>7. Christianity</strong></p>
<p>“Who” is to do all this “transforming”?</p>
<p><strong>1)</strong> the Trilateral Commission;</p>
<p><strong>2)</strong> Technocracy;</p>
<p><strong>3)</strong> the United Nations; and</p>
<p><strong>4)</strong> Non-Government Organizations (NGOs).</p>
<p>We note that neither the American People nor the Congress of the United States of America are party to the transformation. Technocracy and Trilateralism and the United Nations and Non-governmental organizations are the four horses on which the New International Economic Order is riding into our lives. Keep that in mind as we go.</p>
<p>Mr. Wood gives us things to notice, things being used by Technocracy to “transform” us:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>1. Agenda 21</strong><br/>
<strong>2. sustainable development</strong><br/>
<strong>3. smart meters</strong><br/>
<strong>4. climate change</strong><br/>
<strong>5. cap and trade</strong><br/>
<strong>6. the Green Economy</strong><br/>
<strong>7. Human enhancement</strong> (Trans-Humanism: the merger of man and machine, literally)</p>
<p>As John B. Wells allows Mr. Wood to lay it all out in full, supporting knowledge is provided to the viewer to flesh-out the above listings, plus more. John B. and Patrick discuss “Scientism”, and Patrick Wood offers a passage by the “father of Technocracy”, Henri de Saint-Simon:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>(</strong>Quoting<strong>):</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">“<em>A scientist, my dear friends, is a man who foresees; it is because science provides the means to predict that it is useful, and the scientists are superior to all other men.</em>” <strong>(</strong>End Quote<strong>)</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>Scientism Is Central To Technocracy</strong></em></h2>
<p> </p>
<p><a href="../wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Technocracy-Logo.png"><img alt="Technocracy Logo" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5879" height="89" src="../wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Technocracy-Logo.png" width="349"/></a></p>
<p><strong>Science shall tell us</strong> what to do, as evidenced by myriad manifestations ranging from regulating how long one may spend in one’s shower at home to the EPA’s wish to outlaw wood-burning stoves to central regulation of one’s thermostat from downtown, to the elimination of privately-owned single-dwelling homes and private automobiles as called for by the United Nations’ Agenda 21. Scientism is at the base of Technocracy. Here are some notes from Patrick Wood regarding Scientism:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">1. The application of scientific methods to social and political modeling<br/>
2. Science is the absolute and only access to truth and reality about man and the universe<br/>
3. Scientism is specifically opposed to the Holy Bible as truth<br/>
4. Scientism upholds Atheism – there is no God<br/>
5. Scientism purports to be predictive, able to foretell the future<br/>
6. Scientism rejects any opposing inquiry<br/>
7. Scientism demands acceptance by non-scientists</p>
<p><strong>Scientism is defined at Wikipedia this way:</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>“Scientism is belief in the universal applicability of the scientific method and approach, and the view that empirical science constitutes the most authoritative worldview or most valuable part of human learning to the exclusion of other viewpoints.”</em></p>
<p> In the three and one-half hour video interview by John B. Wells of <a href="http://caravantomidnight.com/library/" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://caravantomidnight.com/library/', 'Caravan To Midnight ');" target="_blank">Caravan To Midnight </a>Patrick Wood points out that Ray Kurzweil, a senior scientist for Google, is a trans-humanist. Kurzweil wrote the 2005 book entitled “<strong>The Singularity Is Near: When Humans Transcend Biology</strong>”. Kurzweil, being a Google hotshot, works with the Chair of the Google corporation, Eric Emerson Schmidt, who is a Trilateral Commission member.</p>
<p><strong>From Wikipedia</strong> &lt; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Schmidt" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Schmidt', 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Schmidt');" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Schmidt</a> &gt;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Google founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin interviewed Schmidt. Impressed by him, they recruited Schmidt to run their company in 2001 under the guidance of venture capitalists John Doerr and Michael Moritz.</em><br/>
<em> Schmidt joined Google’s board of directors as chairman in March 2001, and became the company’s CEO in August 2001.</em><br/>
<em> In 2013 Schmidt stated that the government surveillance in the United States was the “nature of our society” and that he was not going to “pass judgment on that”. However, on the revelation that the NSA has been secretly spying on Google’s data centers worldwide, he called the practice “outrageous” and criticized the NSA’s collection of Americans phone records</em><br/>
<em> Schmidt was a campaign advisor and major donor to Barack Obama and served on Google’s government relations team. Obama considered him for Commerce Secretary. Schmidt was an informal advisor to the Obama presidential campaign and began campaigning the week of October 19, 2008, on behalf of the candidate. He was mentioned as a possible candidate for the Chief Technology Officer position, which Obama created in his administration. After Obama won in 2008, Schmidt became a member of President Obama’s transition advisory board. He proposed that the easiest way to solve all of the problems of the United States at once, at least in domestic policies, is by a stimulus program that rewards renewable energy and, over time, attempts to replace fossil fuels with renewable energy.</em></p>
<p>Schmidt and Kurzweil work together at Google and Schmidt is a member in the Trilateral Commission. The Trilateral Commission is the chariot for Technocracy’s scientism. Bear that in mind.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Technocracy: The 1930s to Present</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>Technocracy originated in 1932 at Columbia University. It was founded by M. King Hubbert and Howard Scott in 1933. In 1934 they were booted from Columbia, but carried forth their Technocracy by writing the <strong>Technocracy Study Course</strong>. (PDF)  <a href="https://ia600400.us.archive.org/4/items/TechnocracyStudyCourseUnabridged/TechnocracyStudyCourse-NewOpened.pdf" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'download', 'https://ia600400.us.archive.org/4/items/TechnocracyStudyCourseUnabridged/TechnocracyStudyCourse-NewOpened.pdf');" target="_blank">https://ia600400.us.archive.org/4/items/TechnocracyStudyCourseUnabridged/TechnocracyStudyCourse-NewOpened.pdf</a></p>
<p>In 1954 Hubbert created “Peak Oil Theory”, and later became known as the “father of the eco movement”.</p>
<p><strong>Patrick Wood gives some characteristics of Technocracy:</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>By nature it produces volumes of inviolable regulations which are “science based”.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>It creates totalitarian control in the end, but is not socialism or communism.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Technocracy seeks to replace price-based economic system with energy-based system — (energy credits).</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Communism, Marxism, Socialism, and Fascism are all based on a price-based economic system. Technocracy shifts away from that, so it is neither.</em></p>
<h2 style="padding-left: 30px; text-align: center;"><strong>Stop!</strong></h2>
<p>Did we catch that third characteristic of Technocracy above? <em>“…Seeks to replace price-based economic system with energy-based economic system”.</em> That is positively huge! Technocracy is talking about doing away with our way of doing business, our system of money, of monetary exchange, replacing it with “energy credits”, which we may not find authorized in the Constitution — a far cry from coining silver and gold. But of course Scientism, Technocracy, and the thusly-directed geniuses of the Trilateral Commission care not one whit about our Constitution.</p>
<p>At 55 minutes into the video Wood gives us some requirements necessary to make Technocracy work.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong><em>1. Register on a continuing basis the 24 hour-per-day basis of the total net conversion of energy.</em></strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong><em>2. By means of registration of energy converted and consumed, make possible a “balanced load”. </em></strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong><em>3. Provide a continuous inventory of all production and consumption. [Scott, Howard, et al, Technocracy Study Course, p. 232]Think: datamining.</em></strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong><em>4.Provide a specific registration of the type, kind, etc, of all goods and services, where produced and where used.</em></strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong><em>5. Provide specific registration of the consumption of each individual, plus a record and description of the individual.</em></strong></p>
<p>Today, Mr. Wood notes, we have the technology to do these things. Hence Obamacare, the NSA spying on all Americans, Common Core, fitting students into a master plan, etc., etc.  — data collection gone wild. Combined with the Trilateral Commission’s strong-armed reach into seats of governmental power, Technocracy is quite literally transforming America.</p>

<p> </p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>Trilaterals Over Washington</strong></em></h2>
<p> </p>
<p>At about the 01:02:35 point in the video we’re given a bit of a timeline regarding the Trilateral Commission.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>1. The idea was floated at the 1972 Bilderberg meeting</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>2. It was created in 1973 by David Rockefeller and Zbigniew Brzezinski.</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>3. It had 289 hand-picked members.</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>4. It’s three economic regions of primary focus were Japan, North America, and Europe.</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>5. There were 97 U.S. members, both “R”s and “D”s.</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>6. Members are primarily bankers, industrialists, academics, politicians, media, law firms, and NGOs.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">In 1976 the Trilateral Commission hijacked the White House / Executive Office. Brzezinski had picked Carter for the White House, and according to Barry Goldwater’s autobiography both Rockefeller and Brzezinski groomed Carter and helped get him in. Then as the American people blinked Carter appointed Brzezinski to be his National Security Adviser. Carter then appointed almost a third of the American Trilateral membership to top Cabinet and Administration posts.</p>
<p> They took over government on behalf of economic policies for International consolidation which would foster:</p>
<p>1. a New International Economic Order</p>
<p>2. promote interdependence</p>
<p>3. promote “free trade” by dismantling tariffs and trade barriers.</p>
<p><strong>Wood:</strong> (quote): <em>“It was an economic takeover but they needed the political machinery to pull it off. Technocracy is not a political system — it is an economic system.”</em> (end quote)</p>
<p>* In June 1992 Bush-41 attended the Earth Summit where the Agenda 21 was born.</p>
<p>* In March of 1993 Clinton announced his “National Partnership For Reinventing Government”.</p>
<p>* In April of 1993 the Agenda 21 book was published.</p>
<p>* In June of 1993 Clinton signed Executive Order 12852 creating the President’s Council on Sustainable Development.</p>
<p>* On September 11, 1993 Clinton signed Executive Order 12862, the “National Performance Review/Reinventing Government”.</p>
<p>* In April of 2005 Bush-43 created the National Intelligence Agency, seating for its first Director John Negroponte, a Trilateralist.</p>
<p>I grew quite excited when next Patrick Wood brought up, at about the 01:11:30 mark in the interview, Brzezinski’s book from back in 1970.  Wood says that “Between Two Ages: America’s Role In The Technetronic Era” is the book which launched the Technocracy and Trilateral movement.</p>
<p><img alt="BetweenTwoAges_Brzezinaki" class="wp-image-5886 aligncenter" height="250" src="../wp-content/uploads/2015/04/BetweenTwoAges_Brzezinaki.jpg" width="172"/></p>
<p>I do not really know Patrick Wood, but have been following his work for about ten years, having first appreciated his writing on the Bank for International Settlements at his website. He chances to be the only man I know of, beside myself, who has a copy of Brzezinski’s “Between Two Ages: America’s Role In The Technetronic Era”. I had run across a copy after viewing Michael C. Ruppert’s 9/11 video in 2002. In 2007 I took my copy of this book to the State capitol of Montana and held it up while speaking before the Senate Judiciary Committee regarding some bill which was going through at that time. I showed the Committee members the book and read them a few passages from the book. I will share with you now the passages I read out loud to the Committee.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong><em>“The technetronic era involves the gradual appearance of a more controlled society. Such a society would be dominated by an elite, unrestrained by traditional values…<br/>
</em></strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong><em> “Today we are again witnessing the emergence of transnational elites…[whose] ties cut across national boundaries… It is likely that before long the social elites of most of the more advanced countries will be highly internationalist or globalist in spirit and outlook…. </em></strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong><em> “Within a few years the rebels in the more advanced countries who today have the most visibility will be joined by a new generation making its claim to power in government and business… accepting as routine managerial processes current innovations such as planning-programming-budgeting systems (PPBS) … A national information grid that will integrate existing electronic data banks is already being developed…. The projected world information grid, for which Japan, Western Europe, and the United States are most suited, could create the basis for a common educational program, for the adoption of common academic standards…. </em></strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong><em> “The nation-state is gradually yielding its sovereignty. … In the economic-technological field, some international cooperation has already been achieved, but further progress will require greater American sacrifices. More intensive efforts to shape a new world monetary structure will have to be undertaken, with some consequent risk to the present relatively favorable American position.”</em> </strong></p>
<p>Can you believe that? Brzezinski wrote that forty-five years ago in 1970. He could see what was coming in scientific fields, and David Rockefeller could see that Brzezinski was seeing just what the globalist elite had been seeing in the political field. Rockefeller tapped Brzezinski quickly and they co-founded the Trilateral Commission in 1973.  Brzezinski is a very bright mind, but one which leans toward Technocracy and scientism, which ultimately leads to a one-world government system in the political realm and a one-world economic grid with which to control the populations of the earth. Oddly enough, Brzezinski was a professor at the very campus where Technocracy was born in 1932, Columbia University, when Rockefeller (in Rush Limbaugh’s word for it) “plucked” Brzezinski. (As Rush was meaning it, Rockefeller “hand-picked” Brzezinski.)</p>
<p>Brzezinski had used the word “technetronic” in the title of his book. Patrick Wood notes that “Technetronic” and “Technocracy” are closely linked, practically interchangeable.  So let me interject something here please —</p>
<p>Brzezinski was envisioning in 1970 a <em>gradual appearance of a more controlled society.</em> He called it the “Technetronic Era” for Technocracy, in which his book is heavily immersed. He co-founded the Trilateral Commission with that sort of ideology in mind.</p>
<p>Let us pause for about four minutes to allow Mr. Brzezinski to explain himself, courtesy of C-SPAN:</p>
<div class="video-container">
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="615" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KKq_rpFPidw?rel=0" width="820"></iframe>
</div>
<p>Is America’s so-called “war on terror”, which is now turning inward on the American people ourselves, really just a massive promotion by governmental and private sector players who seek to regulate and control the  patterns of traditional American behavior toward the policies desired by an Elite, who are “internationalists” who believe in the power of a totally surveilled societal structure?</p>
<p>That aside, Patrick Wood notes that the U.S. President appoints the head of the World Bank, and that of the eight heads of the World Bank since its inception six have been Trilateralists. Six out of the eight heads of the World Bank is a staggering percentage. But Patrick Wood goes much deeper in looking into Technocracy’s grip on the inner workings of our government. He lists all Presidents and Vice Presidents since Carter who are Trilateralists. He lists all Presidentially-appointed U.S. Trade Representatives who are Trilateralists.  He lists the ten out of seventeen National Security Advisers who are/were Trilateralists. All are named in the video interview by John B. Wells.</p>
<p>The Trilateral Commission is such a small elite group, but they manage to permeate our Federal offices in departments and agencies. They are heavily tied in with the representatives of the military-industrial complex, the machinery of war.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">So What Is The New International Economic Order?</h2>
<p> </p>
<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_5908" style="width: 376px"><a href="../wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Patrick-Wood-personal.jpg"><img alt="Patrick Wood" class=" wp-image-5908" height="337" src="../wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Patrick-Wood-personal.jpg" width="366"/></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Patrick Wood</p></div>
<p><strong>According to Patrick Wood, this new order is:</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">1. The Technetronic Era</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">2. A controlled society in which the Elite rule</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">3. Primary actors and planners of economic life will be global banks and multi-national corporations.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">4. A continuous surveillance of every citizen</p>

<p>At about two hours into the interview Mr. Wood moves the mark even further. He reminds us of something from <a href="http://www.unep.org/" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.unep.org/', 'UNEP');" target="_blank"><em><strong>UNEP</strong></em></a>, (the UN’s Environment Programme), called the <a href="http://www.unep.org/greeneconomy/" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.unep.org/greeneconomy/', 'Green Economy Initiative');" target="_blank"><em><strong>Green Economy Initiative</strong></em></a>.  He tells us that “The Green Economy” is Technocracy. According to Wood, a green economy implies a “de-coupling” of resource use and environmental impacts from economic growth. He reminds us that UNEP says:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>“These initiatives, both public and private, provide the mechanism for reconfiguration of businesses, infrastructure and institutions, and for the adoption of sustainable consumption and production processes”.</em></p>
<p>Reconfiguring businesses, infrastructure and institutions means overhauling our very society, our way of life, for openers, and it can and will get much worse as control by the Elite is expanded. Bill Clinton, a failed Rhodes Scholar, did say he would “<em>reinvent government</em>“. This is what he had in mind. Recall, when G.H.W. Bush could not get NAFTA through Congress, Bill Clinton did, and that was just a beginning.</p>
<p>Patrick Wood next reports that the World Council of Churches, at their 2014 <em><strong>“Interfaith Summit on Climate Change” said proudly, the “World’s faiths will declare themselves, irrevocably, as Green Faiths”.</strong></em></p>
<p>Next we learn about “<a href="http://homepage.ntu.edu.tw/~jryeh/cursus/2006/sd/R4%20reflecsive%20law.pdf" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'download', 'http://homepage.ntu.edu.tw/~jryeh/cursus/2006/sd/R4%20reflecsive%20law.pdf');" target="_blank"><em><strong>Reflexive Law</strong></em></a>” as “<em>Legal Paradigm For Sustainable Development</em>“.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em> “At the same time, sustainable development’s broad sweep strains our intellectual grasp of its meaning and</em> <em>outruns the capacity of our current legal and political systems to channel society’s activities toward its</em> <em>achievement…there is no doubt that sustainable development needs new paradigms to transform it from visionary rhetoric to a viable political goal. The World Summit on Sustainable Development showed a world desperately seeking effective sustainable development policies and strategies. The desperation was reflected in the new mantra of “governance” and the shifting emphasis in sustainable development measures from “Type 1” traditional regulation and government programs to “Type 2” non-regulatory private or public-private partnership initiatives… This essay will consider whether the sociological construct “reflexive law,” which comes out of the German sociology of law tradition, and some American offshoots such as “democratic experiments” with non-regulatory schemes, might help sustainable development resolve its conceptual dilemmas. Reflexive law has immediate appeal because it speaks to the sustainable development mandate for integrated decision making: it normatively urges social systems or subsystems (such as science, economics, the</em> <em>marketplace, politics, and law itself) to communicate and to interact. Moreover, reflexive law teaches that law works best by specifying procedures for regulated entities to observe in striving for a complex objective like sustainable development,..”</em>  &gt;Link to text: <a href="http://homepage.ntu.edu.tw/~jryeh/cursus/2006/sd/R4%20reflecsive%20law.pdf" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'download', 'http://homepage.ntu.edu.tw/~jryeh/cursus/2006/sd/R4%20reflecsive%20law.pdf');" target="_blank">http://homepage.ntu.edu.tw/~jryeh/cursus/2006/sd/R4%20reflecsive%20law.pdf</a></p>
<p>So Technocracy will put an end to “rigid” law and transform it into reflexive law, all the better to suit the needs of their global government. Remember, “Sustainable Development” is a UN phrase originating in Agenda 21. So now we see that Mr. Wood was correct in his opening assessments, in which he said that the Trilateral Commission’s Technocracy would transform not only government and economics and religion, but also would transform “law”.</p>
<p>But he also said the Trilaterals want to transform “energy”, “humanity”, and “Christianity”. He has laid in the fact that Agenda 21 is being used by Technocracy to transform things, so let’s see what he says about transforming “energy”.</p>
<p>At about 02:15:00 we learn that the Global Smart Grid is both national and international. Mr. Wood points out that the 2009 stimulus money went to energy companies globally to kick-start Smart Grid. At this <a href="http://www.terrawatts.com/" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.terrawatts.com/', 'link');" target="_blank"><em><strong>link</strong></em></a> we can read:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>“There is a new world wide web emerging right before our eyes. It is a global energy network and, like the internet, it will change our culture, society and how we do business.  More importantly, it will alter how we use, transform and exchange energy. There is no energy supply problem, there is an energy distribution problem — and the emerging solution is a new world wide web of electricity.”</em></p>
<p>In Kerry Cassidy’s interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtDD25hEBZE" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtDD25hEBZE', 'Catherine Austin Fitts');" target="_blank"><em><strong>Catherine Austin Fitts</strong></em></a>, Ms Fitts has indicated that trillions of  “stimulus dollars” were dispersed globally. The topic of that interview was the “Black Budget”, which itself is yet another tool in the globalists’ tool chest. We may write and read non-stop into all this madness, only to find that the rabbit hole goes deeper and deeper, branches infinitely into a web of incredible overwhelm. So I will force myself to break this off at this point, in agreeing that we all can see that trans-humanism is a threat to human life as we’ve known it, and that Christianity is indeed under attack in America today. I do not think any reader at Oath Keepers national will want to dispute that.</p>
<p>So in summation, let me simply urge every Oath Keeper to get Patrick Wood’s book, view John B. Wells’ interview with Mr. Wood, above, and reassure oneself that while our problems are giants at the national and international level, they are quite controllable at the local level. In harmony with the philosophy of Stewart Rhodes, founder and president of Oath Keepers, acting locally while thinking globally is the best perspective for the preservation of freedom. Mr. Patrick Wood says the same thing in his offered solutions:</p>
<p>1. Act Local</p>
<p>2. Educate and advocate locally.</p>
<p>3. Saturate meetings of City Council, School Boards, planning/zoning meetings, transportation meetings, etc.</p>
<p>4. Support and educate local Sheriffs.</p>
<p>5. Name and shame those who practice un-American thinking and activity.</p>
<p>6. Serve <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misprision_of_treason" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misprision_of_treason', 'Misprision of Treason');" target="_blank"><em><strong>Misprision of Treason</strong></em></a> wherever appropriate.</p>
<p>That falls hand-in-hand with Oath Keepers <a href="https://oathkeepers.org/cpt-community-preparedness-teams/" target="_blank"><em><strong>Community Preparedness Team</strong></em></a> concept as well as with our central mission of <a href="https://oathkeepers.org/oath-keepers-academy/" target="_blank"><strong>educating</strong></a> police and military and firefighter personnel to the meaning in their Oath.</p>

<content:encoded>Here is an email I’ve sent if you are looking for a sample:
<p>Subject: ITAR Amendment—Revisions to Definitions; Data Transmission and Storage</p>
<p>The State Department’s attempt to censor online speech concerning the technical aspects of firearms and ammunition has no tangible benefit. It’s an obvious attempt by the Obama administration to use an Executive Order to push his gun control agenda after Congress defeated it. His censorship violates free speech, 1st Amendment, and restricts the civilian’s knowledge about the arms described in the 2nd Amendment.  Please stop this censorship immediately.  Thank you</p>

<content:encoded>Obama doesn’t quit. He’s still pushing his gun grabbing agenda that Congress previously defeated.  So Obama’s using an Executive Order like he did for his attempted ban of green-tip AR-15 ammo.  But, also like the green-tip ammo, let’s overwhelm the State Department with emails like we did to the ATF. And also like the green-tip ammo, lets push our federal representatives to kill this obvious censorship. Under the NRA’s leadership, ATF “tapped out” quickly. Let’s apply the same pressure to the State Department.   Please reference NRA link above.  Thank you

<content:encoded>“President Obama is using his imperial pen and telephone to curb your rights and bypass Congress through executive action.”
<p>Two things wrong with this sentence.  First we are NOT a monarchy, we are a Constitutional Republic, so as much as obama wishes it was so, there is NO SUCH THING AS AN IMPERIAL PEN AND PHONE here in America.</p>
<p>Second, writing legislation is not a duty/power assigned to the executive branch.  Inferred from this is that when he (obama) writes “By the Authority Invested In Me By the US Constitution”, it actually has to have been “vested” to the executive branch of which he is now the (impersonating) leader of that branch ONLY.  </p>
<p>That power/authority was “vested” to the legislative branch ONLY, and those that serve within that branch may not give, loan, sell, trade, etc that vested authority.  Matter of fact, sicne the US Constitution gives them constitutional remedies to stop other branches from doing unconstitutional things, it might even qualify as *Treason on the part of the legislative branch.</p>
<p>What does this mean?  Obama does Not lawfully have any authority to create legislation that is binding upon the American people. Unfortunately that makes those that are ignorant of their Oath and their duties to the US Constitution – NOT a person – when they implement those unlawful orders they are committing **Terrroism and *Treason, plus Perjury, and other felonies, crimes both criminal and civil.  </p>
<p>If you are in the US military (well, UN Military), or Law enforcement – state and/or generao (federal) at this time learn what the Oath you took means because if you are going to get charged and prosecuted for Treason, Terrorism against the American people make that decision YOUR OWN choice, not just because you were dumbed down enough to “just follow orders” or to “just do your job”.  </p>
<p>Why?  Because when we stop these treasonous scum, there will be a lot that get the death penalty because emotions of the people who had their trust betrayed will be running high.  If you are one of those prosecuted, and we will work to see that ALL are, it would be really stupid to do like some of the Nazis did and die because you “just followed orders” or to “just did your job”.   </p>
<p>So make it YOUR choice, and make it an informed choice.  There is no thing in America as a “Need to know” basis, if you are part of the operation in anyway, YOU NEED TO KNOW THE DETAILS.</p>

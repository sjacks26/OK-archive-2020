<h2 style="text-align: center;">OPEN LETTER TO GOVERNOR FEBRUARY 06 2015</h2>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">To the Governor of Washington: A List of Grievances by</h2>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">We the People</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>by <strong>Kit Lange</strong> | Feb 6, 2015</p>
<p><strong>One of the most important rights</strong> as citizens in a Constitutional Republic is the right to call upon the government for redress of grievances. Unfortunately, We the People are all too familiar with so-called lawmakers who not only ignore the will of the people, but actively work against it. We see this in Washington State as well as other states throughout the country, as legislators continuously pass law after law that directly infringes upon those rights that are outlined as being off-limits to government control.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether our elected officials wish to acknowledge it or not, We the People retain this right to redress, and we present this list of grievances to the Governor of the State of Washington, and demand that they be rectified. As the Washington State Constitution makes clear, all political power resides with the people. As such, We the People demand that our rights be secured and maintained, as the Constitution calls for—not infringed upon and denied.</p>
<p>While these grievances are not solely done at the state level, if the state allows the infringement of rights by the federal government, then the state is also guilty of the same violation.</p>
<p>At the writing of the Declaration of Independence, the founders outlined a list of grievances against King George III. They, too, demanded redress, and were met with the same contempt that many legislators show the people today. We the People, as the holders of political power in the State of Washington and the United States of America, demand that we be heard, and that the following infringements cease immediately:</p>
<p>1. Militarizing police and SWAT Teams</p>
<p>2. Stockpiling of Ammunition while Limiting the Rights of Citizens to Purchase Ammunition</p>
<p>3. Distributing License Plate Readers meant to track the movement of law-abiding citizens.</p>
<p>4. Tracking Cell-Phones with Stingray Devices</p>
<p>5. Turning Cell-Phones into Roving Listening Devices</p>
<p>6. Creating Longitudinal Databases to Track Citizens from Birth to Death</p>
<p>8. Carrying Out Military Drills and Lockdowns in American Cities</p>
<p>9. Tracking People via Facial Recognition</p>
<p>10. Using the TSA to Create Databases of “Suspect Citizens”</p>
<p>11. Carrying out Soft Target Checkpoints</p>
<p>12. Directing Government Workers to Spy on Americans</p>
<p>13. Suspending Habeas Corpus in a Time of Peace with NDAA</p>
<p>14. Using Drones to Spy on Citizens and Map Their Property</p>
<p>15. Directing Government Workers to Spy on Americans and Create Linkage Charts of Patriotic Americans</p>
<p>16. Conducting Widespread Spying Networks Using Fusion Centers and Listing Americans as “Terrorists” Without Trial</p>
<p>17. Carrying Out Constitution-Free Border Control Searches</p>
<p>18. Funding City-Wide Surveillance Cameras</p>
<p>19. The State governor demanding that the Washington State Patrol violate their own oath to the Constitution by authorizing them to suppress the people’s right to the First and Second Amendments through threats of arrest and force.</p>
<p>20. The State Legislature unlawfully and deceitfully reclassifying firearms as “props”.</p>
<p>21. The state legislature arbitrarily denying the right of a group of adults, based on their age, from viewing their government proceedings if they choose to exercise their Second Amendment right.</p>
<p>22. The state legislature continuing to allow the federal government to illegally lay claim to and hold lands belonging to the people of the state of Washington.</p>
<p>23. Infringement upon the unalienable basic right to self-defense of the people through unjust laws that violate not only the federal and state Constitution but natural law.</p>
<p>24. Taxation without representation, through unlawful and unnecessary taxes and fees charged for the exercise of rights, and the repeated refusal of the state legislature to hear and act in accordance with the will of the people and the Constitution that binds their power.</p>
<p>25. The passing of rules in secret by the State House, State Senate, Speaker pro tempore, and the Lieutenant Governor, that directly violate the rules of the people.</p>
<p>26. The abuse of power by elected officials such as (but not limited to) Rep. Laurie Jinkins and Rep. Jim Moeller, who have used their positions to exert control over the people and deny them their rights.</p>
<p>27. The allowance of judges to legislate from the bench that a police officer’s ignorance of the law is grounds for the violation of the People’s rights.</p>
<p>Regardless of inconvenience, the legislature and the Governor cannot violate the rights of the People, and must adhere to their oath. It is imperative that the state government understand that it must operate within the limits of the state and the federal Constitution, and as such, must secure and maintain the rights of the people without question and without infringement. Instead, the legislature has made its own rules and used the force of the state to enforce those rules, which is in and of itself a threat of violence against the People. This is unacceptable.</p>
<p>We seek no violence and do not condone the use of force outside of the blueprint outlined by the Founders. We do, however, seek redress and remind the Governor of his own oath, found in RCW 43.01.020:</p>
<p>“I do solemnly swear that I will support the Constitution of the United States and the Constitution and laws of the state of Washington, and that I will faithfully discharge the duties of the office of Governor to the best of my ability.”</p>
<p>These continued infringements and assaults upon the rights of the people—or the refusal to stop those abuses by legislators and government officials—constitute a blatant and gross violation of that oath. We call upon the Governor of the State of Washington to cease infringement upon the People’s rights and uphold his solemn promise to uphold the Constitution of the United States and that of our state.</p>
<p> </p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>We will not comply. We stand.</strong></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Additional Resources For Getting Up To Speed On This Important Rally</strong></p>
<p>At 10:00 a.m. at the State Capitol in Olympia, Washington, a coalition of Constitutionalists will engage in civil disobedience. This will be an open-carry rally. Three Washington State Representatives will be joined by Mike Vanderboegh, (Founder of the III% movement), in giving speeches to the rally. Media will be present. Oath Keepers who attend are encouraged to wear your Oath Keepers gear. This event is endorsed by our Founder, Stewart Rhodes. See Stewart Rhodes’ statement below. Oath Keepers will remain non-confrontational and will work with authorities to ensure that this event goes peacefully and powerfully toward empowering the People of Washington to nullify unlawful rules, edicts, and “laws” of the State and its legislature. We have the moral high ground here, and the statist anti-Constitutionists are fearful that our message of the Rule of Law will get out to the rest of the nation. Oath Keepers will display dignity and non-aggressive postures at all times. We here at National are proud of all who can show up in support of this important rally.</p>

<p>Stewart Rhodes’ endorsement for this event:</p>
<p><strong>Endorsement from STEWART RHODES:</strong> <em>Members of Oath Keepers, I fully support this rally and planned peaceful civil disobedience and I encourage you to attend if you can. However, I want to make it clear that each of you have multiple options here:</em></p>
<p><em>1. You can go and simply participate in the rally (and you can choose to do so armed or unarmed – personally, I would be armed, since it is an open carry rally, but that is an individual choice).</em></p>
<p><em>2. You can go and outreach to the police and encourage them to respect and protect the rights of the protesters. That is a vital task that we Oath Keepers are pretty good at, and we should be doing that.</em></p>
<p><em>3. And/or you can also go into the Gallery of the legislature with the others who intend on using civil disobedience against the new rule put in place by the Speaker of the Legislature, that bans the open carry of firearms in the Gallery for the first time in WA state history (and make sure they know this is only a rule by the speaker, not even a law). If you do choose to take part in the peaceful civil disobedience, go there willing to follow the instructions of the organizers of the event, and the leaders there, such as Rep. Matt Shea, Anthony Bosworth, and MIke Vanderboegh, and go there willing to be arrested, in case that is the outcome (that is what peaceful civil disobedience is all about, after all – it is defying some edict, while knowing you may be arrested for doing so, and being willing to go through that experience).</em></p>
<p><em>You can do any one of the above, or all of the above. Personally, if I was able to be there (I am handling a family emergency at the moment that keeps me from attending), I would do all three. I would participate in the open carry rally, I would outreach to the police there, and I would participate in the civil disobedience. Such civil disobedience is necessary in the fight to restore our Republic, and in our mission to defend the Constitution. But each person needs to make a decision for themselves about what they are willing to do at any such event. Not all are at the point of being ready to risk arrest while undertaking peaceful civil disobedience. And that is fine. I do encourage you to begin to exercise those civil disobedience “muscles” but that is an individual choice. I will point out, however, that civil disobedience is a much honored American tradition, starting with the Founding Generation which intentionally refused to comply with multiple edicts, statutes, and rules set by Parliament and King. They refused to comply and used peaceful civil disobedience for many years leading up to the outset of fighting. They held town hall meeting right under the nose of General Gage, in direct violation of an edict of Parliament that banned town hall meetings. They smuggled around egregious restrictions on where they could send their ships and cargo. They refused to pay unjust taxes, and they circumvented or openly defied multiple other statutes passed by Parliament, and multiple acts by the Royal Governors. Civil disobedience, nullification, and defiance were the life-blood of the cause of the Colonists in the years leading up to the outbreak of the actual American Revolution. Learn from their example, and get yourself ready to use the same tactics, which will nor only further the cause of liberty, but will help you to become stronger in your hearts and minds.</em></p>
<p><em>I have attended multiple open carry rallies, and I have participated in several acts of civil disobedience, and I can tell you from personal experience, that it is good for the soul. I encourage you to go if you can.</em></p>
<p><em>For the Republic,</em></p>
<p><em>Stewart Rhodes</em></p>

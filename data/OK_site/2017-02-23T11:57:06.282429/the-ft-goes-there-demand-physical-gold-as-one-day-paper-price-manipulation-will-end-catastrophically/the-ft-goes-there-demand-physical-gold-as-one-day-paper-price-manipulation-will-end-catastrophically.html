<p>This is beginning to look like the biggest fraud in history is finally being uncovered. The video is Glenn Beck’s view on the subject. It is from his show on The Blaze done on 01/08/2014. That the Financial Times is speaking of it means it is starting to go mainstream. – Shorty Dawkins, Associate Editor</p>

But convincing the Bundebsbank to demand delivery was peanuts  compared to changing the tune of the Financial Times – that bastion of  fiat “money”, and where the word gold is mocked and ridiculed, and those  who see the daily improprieties in the gold market as nothing but  “conspiracy theorists” – to say the magic words: “Learn from Buba and  demand delivery for true price of gold”, adding that “<strong>one day the ties that bind this pixelated gold may break, with potentially catastrophic results.</strong>”</p>
<p>In other words, precisely what we have been saying since the beginning.</p>
<p>Welcome to the ‘conspiracy theorist’ club, boys.</p>
<p><em>From the FT’s Neil Collins: “<a href="http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/1586a7fe-84d6-11e3-a793-00144feab7de.html" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/1586a7fe-84d6-11e3-a793-00144feab7de.html', 'Learn  from Buba and demand delivery for true price of gold: One day the ties  that bind the actual and the traded commodity will snap');" target="_blank">Learn  from Buba and demand delivery for true price of gold: One day the ties  that bind the actual and the traded commodity will snap</a>:</em></p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<blockquote><p><span class="firstletter">A</span> year ago the <a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/97970542-5fd2-11e2-b128-00144feab49a.html#axzz2r2A73DmC" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/97970542-5fd2-11e2-b128-00144feab49a.html#axzz2r2A73DmC', 'Bundesbank announced');" target="_blank" title="Bundesbank weighs bullion against public pressure - FT.com">Bundesbank announced</a> that it intended to repatriate 700 tons of Germany’s <a href="http://www.ft.com/topics/themes/Gold" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.ft.com/topics/themes/Gold', 'gold');" target="_blank">gold</a> from Paris and New York<strong>.  Although a couple of jumbo jets could have  managed the transatlantic  removal, it made security sense to ship the  load in smaller  consignments</strong>. Just how small, and over how long, has  only just become apparent.</p>
<p>Last month Jens Weidmann, Bundesbank president, admitted that just 37   tons had arrived in Frankfurt. The original timescale, to complete the   transfer by 2020, was leisurely enough, but at this rate it would take   20 years for a simple operation. Well, perhaps not so simple. While he   awaits delivery, Herr Weidmann is welcome to come and look through the   bars in the Federal Reserve’s vaults, but the question is: whose bars   are they?</p>
<p>In  the “armchair farmer” fraud you are told: “Look, this is your pig, in  the sty.” <strong>It works until everyone wants physical delivery of their pig,  which is why Buba’s move last year caused such a stir</strong>.  After all nobody  knows whether there are really 260m ounces of gold in  Fort Knox, because  the US government won’t let auditors inside.</p>
<p>The delivery problem for the Fed is a different breed of pig. The   gold market is far more than exchanging paper money for precious metal.   Indeed the metal seems something of a sideshow. In June last year the   average volume of gold cleared in London hit 29m ounces per day. The   world’s mines are producing 90m ounces per year. The traded volume was   many times the cleared volume.</p>
<p>The paper gold in the London Bullion Market takes the familiar forms   that bankers have turned into profit machines: futures, options,   leveraged trades, collateralised obligations, ETFs . . . a storm of   exotic instruments, each of which is carefully logged, cross-checked and   audited.</p>
<p>Or perhaps not. High-flying traders find such  backroom work tedious,  and prefer to let some drone do it, just as they  did with those  money-market instruments that fuelled the banking crisis.  The <strong>drones  will have full control of the paper trail, won’t they?  There’s surely  no chance that the Fed’s little delivery difficulty has  anything to do  with the cat’s-cradle of <a href="http://www.tocquevillefunds.com/insights/lets-get-physical" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.tocquevillefunds.com/insights/lets-get-physical', 'pledges based on the gold in its vaults');" target="_blank" title="Tocquevillefunds.com - Let's Get Physical: gold bullion and Bitcoin">pledges based on the gold in its vaults</a>?</strong></p>
<p>John Hathaway suspects there is. He worries about  all the paper (and  pixels) linked to gold. He runs the Tocqueville gold  fund (the clue is  in the name) and doesn’t share the near-universal <a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/9e22bbc4-82c0-11e3-8119-00144feab7de.html?siteedition=uk#axzz2r2A73DmC" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/9e22bbc4-82c0-11e3-8119-00144feab7de.html?siteedition=uk#axzz2r2A73DmC', 'gloom of London’s gold analysts');" target="_blank" title="Gold analysts most bearish since 2002 - FT.com">gloom of London’s gold analysts</a>, who a year ago forecast an average $1700 for 2013. It is currently $1,260.</p>
<p>As has been remarked here before, forecasting the price is for mugs  and bugs. <strong>But  one day the ties that bind this pixelated gold may break,  with  potentially catastrophic results. So if you fancy gold at today’s   depressed price, learn from Buba and demand delivery.</strong></p></blockquote>

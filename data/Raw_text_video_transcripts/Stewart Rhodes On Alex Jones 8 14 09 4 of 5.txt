AJ: I want to go to phone calls. But I did want to mention the joker posters. These were put up in California, then Mark Dyes had a contest, I copied him and had a contest. A few people put these on post office boxes, big deal, but they’re saying big federal felony, terrorism. Now they’re saying it’s an act of terror and abusive and there’s victims if you even put it up with other posters. They’re saying the poster itself is racist, it’s a hate crime to say socialism. I’m not kidding, that’s in the news. They have people on the news saying I need to be arrested.

SR: That’s content-based discrimination. They’re targeting the content, it’s not content neutral. That’s unconstitutional.

AJ: You’re a constitutional lawyer, I was going to ask your opinion. So clearly this is discrimination then.

SR: Sure, ask the ACLU they’ll tell you the same thing, I hope. That it’s clearly content based. Are they doing the same thing to everybody else that puts up a flyer? No they’re not. So it’s based on your content. That’s unconstitutional. I don’t care what you’re saying. You can have the Klan putting up a swastika and if they are singled out because of the content, that’s also content-based discrimination. That’s why the ACLU defended the Klan’s right to march through Skokie, Illinois. As painful and horrible as that was, it was to protect the principle that you don’t discriminate on content.

AJ: Because the minute that the Klan, every one of them federal officers, I’ve been to these events to protest them. It’s just feds period. It’s come out over and over that it’s feds to demonize the patriot movement. They’ll get up there and give pro-2A and anti-NWO speeches, all to demonize us. Later it comes out they are feds or informants or the leaders are being paid to do it. Yeah, you take those big fat federal agents right away, you lose your right. That’s why these people sending me emails saying I deserve to go to prison, that just shows they haven’t been teaching civics in the schools.

SR: (0:02:07.8) They don’t understand their own history. The Civil Rights movement in the 60s would have gone nowhere if they could have content-based discrimination. That’s why they resorted to peaceful marches, because you have a constitutional right. 1A, sadly the other parts of the Bill of Rights haven’t been as strongly protected. But 1A is pretty strongly protected, it’s the most potent weapon we have legally, as far as the level of protection for it. You can thank the ACLU for that, they get some things right.

AJ: You’re talking to the military and police, 10s of thousands have contacted you, you have huge events, it’s exploding. What is their view on seeing all this classic, really Maoist is the closest thing I would call it, tyranny manifesting. Are they redoubling their efforts to warn other military and police? Clearly if the government organs and surrogates like SPLC are coming after you, they are. What’s the sense of the membership?

SR: It’s making them more resolved. And like you said earlier, it makes it clear that we are in the game now that we all have dreaded. It’s happening to us right now. We’re hearing back from active duty, in fact I have an active duty guy on our website right now, who are saying I’m spreading this as far and as fast as possible. We want to help them, we want to put billboards up outside of bases. We want to make sure we get a care package in the hands of 40k active duty troops by Christmas, that’s my goal. We’re starting state networks, we have state chapters with state directors. Our goal is to have an active OK chapter in every county of every state, make sure the sheriff is squared away, make sure the police know who the veterans are, they all become friends and have each other’s back. Our goal is to make sure we have the county’s squared away from the bottom up. We’re working as fast as we can. Sheriff Mack, speaking of sheriffs, has a response to SPLC that he sent me, we posted it on our site. Folks can read his well-reasoned response on our site. Lt. Cmdr. Gillie, who’s an active duty Naval Commander who was with us at Lexington, is writing his response, we’ll post that when he sends it in.

AJ: (0:04:23.5) Good. If we give in to this chilling effect, in fact next Wednesday I’ll announce the winners to the great Obama poster contest. I’m gonna go ahead and next week announce another contest to keep this going. Regardless all of you who put posters up won, be sure to follow your local laws, don’t give these thugs to selectively enforce on you. Because they’re trying to threaten me, because they’re saying I don’t have 1A but Obama can be in the Washington Post saying put my posters up on stop signs. He’s saying do something illegal, we’re not. They’re saying we’re not even allowed to legally say this. I’m not giving in to this intimidation.

SR: Don’t. If you need a lawyer give me a call.

AJ: If we give in to the intimidation, they win. They wouldn’t be going absolutely crazy over this though if it wasn’t scaring them. Just the exercise of people putting things up, just the exercise of getting off your butts is a literal psychological and spiritual shift. SR, comments.

SR: It’s like V for Vendetta. After a while, everyone was running around spray painting V’s. and whether the state decrees it or not, you should exercise your 1A right. I have an idea for you, how about one that says oath breaker. Below the picture.

AJ: That’s a good idea. Oath breaker. Or liar. He’s been caught lying about everything he said he’d do. Liar.

SR: But the response should be to go out and do it more.

AJ: That’s what the listeners are doing. I said listeners be careful, and the listeners are going no. They’re doing it to police stations. The spirit of 1776 is alive and well. I would caution the military and police to think twice about what side of history they want to be on. Your gut tells you to join us.

AJ: (0:06:23.5) We’re going to keep SR 5 minutes in the next hour, so we can get to your calls. Let’s talk to Brian in NY, you’re on the air with fellow thought criminal, he dare asked the military and police to keep their oath. Go ahead Brian. Okay, let’s go to Brian in NJ.

Brian: Hey Alex, how you doing. The comment I wanted to make is regarding Obama saying to put his signs on stop signs. I actually think that might be a good idea. Imagine if half the street corners in this country had signs that say stop Obama.

AJ: Yeah, but see you can put a sign up that shows him as god or looks like Stalin with him looking like this. But the minute you put one up defiling his godliness, the locals just flip out. The government comes out and lies and says everyone in the town hates it, it’s racist, remove it. That’s why the elite wanted him in office, so they could play the race card any time you disagree with them. I think it’s blowing up in their face though. Now you can’t say the word socialist? Let’s get a comment from SR of OK.

SR: Yeah there’s a tough line to walk there. You want to respect the property and public safety of your city, but you also want to have an act of defiance. I can’t recommend that they break the law, but let me say you should exercise your 1A rights vigorously and fully.

AJ: Why do you think I’m getting sent the videos of people saying we’re going to put them on police stations now. And I’m telling people don’t do it, but the spirit of 1776 is so strong, I wonder if the police know down the road, if the NWO comes in, it’s not going to be street signs. 
 SR: Well you shouldn’t look at the cops as your enemy. This is what they want you to do. They want that. I would recommend not doing that. Put it on town halls, city hall, on another oath breakers house or something like that. You don’t put it on the police officers property for now. For now, give them the benefit of the doubt that they’re going to do what’s right, and let them see you as their ally, not their opponent.

AJ: I agree, that’s why I’m saying this needs to be done. Anything else Brian?

Brian: I’m just saying do what the president suggests. If he wants his name on stop signs, just imagine what that message would say, stop Obama.

AJ: What would happen if they arrest someone putting it on a stop sign, or maybe below the sign so it doesn’t endanger public safety, then you get a ticket or arrested, you can go in with official letterhead of the president telling his constituents to do it. Is the court then going to go after Obama?

SR: No.

Brian: I was gonna say, it’s not going to stop the courts, but it’s gonna say hey Obama said to do this, so I’m just following the President’s orders.

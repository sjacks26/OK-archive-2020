<p><em>This article was written by Mac Slavo and originally published at <a href="http://www.shtfplan.com/conspiracy-fact-and-theory/martial-law-concern-about-jade-helm-is-racist-because-we-have-a-black-president_07062015" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.shtfplan.com/conspiracy-fact-and-theory/martial-law-concern-about-jade-helm-is-racist-because-we-have-a-black-president_07062015', 'SHTFplan.com');">SHTFplan.com</a></em></p>
<p>Desperate to rebrand conspiratorial concern about the coming Jade Helm training exercises – fears that it could be an attempt to bring martial law to ‘hostile’ Texas – the media is spinning its wheels to portray opponents of the military occupation as <em>racists</em>.</p>
<p>Yes, concern about martial law and a military takeover under an emergency pretext is now racist… not because the issue clearly effects everyone, but just because there’s a black president… that’s a good one.</p>
<p>Denial runs deep. Disturbing preparations for martial law and civil unrest have been ongoing for decades, and ramping up since 9/11, not since the election of Barack Obama. Yet, the system has been in damage control mode sense news of the training exercise spread on the web, and sounded the alarm about potential threats to liberty.</p>
<p>They insist: <em>No, Jade Helm isn’t a military takeover of Texas.</em></p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/the-americans-are-coming-texans-fear-obama-led-us-military-invasion/2015/07/04/58047fee-2001-11e5-84d5-eb37ee8eaa61_story.html" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/the-americans-are-coming-texans-fear-obama-led-us-military-invasion/2015/07/04/58047fee-2001-11e5-84d5-eb37ee8eaa61_story.html', 'Washington Post');" target="_blank">Washington Post</a> talked to locals in Bastrop, Texas where Jade Helm will be headquartered – deliberately dragging racial tensions into a debate about centered around growing federal government power over states and the people that has been going on over the course of many presidents.</p>
<blockquote><p>“If it were any other president but Obama, it would not be an issue.”</p>
[…]
<p><strong>“The truth is, this stems a fair amount from the fact that we have a black president,”</strong> said Terry Orr, who was Bastrop’s mayor from 2008 to 2014. “People think the government is just not on the side of the white guy,” Orr said.</p>
[…]
<p>Bastrop’s current mayor, Kenneth Kesselus [said] “The middle class is getting squeezed and they’ve got to take it out on somebody, and Obama is a great target.”</p>
[…]
<p><strong>The Jade Helm backlash has been a “red flag” that our county “still has a lot of things they need to come to terms with,”</strong> Jackson said, including the anger and disrespect being directed at the president.</p>
[…]
<p>Another man was <strong>“shocked by what he views as racist undertones in much of the objection to Jade Helm.”</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>This is the most ridiculous tactic yet tried to counter those troubled by the militarization of America and the hidden intentions of those who are in power.</p>
<p>Though many were against these things when they surfaced under George W. Bush or Bill Clinton, it is apparently the sign of a “sick country” that has “deep troubled issues” about race… and… something about the Confederate flag… and racism, against military occupation.</p>
<p>Yeah, right.</p>
<p>Mastering the human domain indeed… with the age old tactic of divide and conquer.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.intellihub.com/mainstream-media-claims-jade-helm-fears-are-racist-as-media-spin-continues-ahead-of-planned-urban-military-exercise/" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'https://www.intellihub.com/mainstream-media-claims-jade-helm-fears-are-racist-as-media-spin-continues-ahead-of-planned-urban-military-exercise/', 'Alex Thomas of Intellihub');" target="_blank"><strong>Alex Thomas of Intellihub</strong></a> points out, it is a masterful misdirection from the real issues of military training in American cities… even as we’ve been shown how they could be used domestically during crises:</p>
<blockquote><p>To put this hit piece in perspective one has to sit back and remember what has actually gone on in the last three months.</p>
<p>We are <a href="https://www.intellihub.com/?s=jade+helm" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'https://www.intellihub.com/?s=jade+helm', 'literally seeing dozens of urban military exercises');" target="_blank">literally seeing dozens of urban military exercises</a> with a strong domestic focus being conducted across the country in the lead up to Jade Helm and instead of investigating this fact, one of the biggest news outlets in the country has decided to instead imply that all the Americans worried about the training are racist.</p></blockquote>
<p>The concern about martial law has – again – been going on for decades amid eroding civil rights, declarations of emergency powers, increased disregard for the Constitution and Bill of Rights and <a href="http://www.shtfplan.com/headline-news/u-s-military-grants-itself-the-authority-to-deploy-troops-in-american-cities-without-presidential-or-local-approval_05162013" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.shtfplan.com/headline-news/u-s-military-grants-itself-the-authority-to-deploy-troops-in-american-cities-without-presidential-or-local-approval_05162013', 'systematic violations of Posse Comitatus, the 1870s-era law');" target="_blank">systematic violations of Posse Comitatus, the 1870s-era law</a> that bars the federal government from using military to police domestic America.</p>
<p>This absurd article may fuel another false media narrative about race (in the attempt to downplay the scope of Jade Helm) but the issue is squarely about tyranny and dictatorship – not racism.</p>

<content:encoded>Our country is in trouble that we all know and agree.We live in a divided nation for many many reasons but I believe the #1 reason is sin. Many of us have sinned and repented thank God forJesus, but many of us have not repented including those at the fed level.Read the Old Testament The book of Kings.When you do you will find that a good king and the people had peace and prosperity, an evil king and the people had no peace or prosperity.Funny thing sounds like us don’t it.God Bless America and the Oath Keepers!

<content:encoded>Now if you really dig into your history you will find out that the civil war had to do with states rights not about slavery, if it had to do with slavery why did it take that Lincoln 3 years to “free” the slaves? When Lincoln came into “power” he raised the tax on a bale of cotton from 10 cents per 100 weight to $1.30 per 100 weight.

<content:encoded>If this country is continually duped into getting rid of the Confederate Flag for misguided reasons? Then they better get rid of LGBT racist Flag!

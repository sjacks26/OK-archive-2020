## Two people are talking. It’s hard to understand either of them

MS1: What would you say, what does this memorial say to the generations coming?

RB: I’ll have to go back and tell you why I’m here today. In 1945 [can’t hear a few words]. A Filipino escaped from a prison, told us that at 7 the next morning, they were gonna start shooting all the prisoners. At 7, he said they stack their guns and change guard. This was about the 23 of Feb. They loaded us on trucks, took us to an airport. Said there were 2146 prisoners who were gonna be shot. Our army was getting so close, they were getting scared. There was no way we could let that happen. 121 were taken to an airport, we jumped and hit the prison camp at exactly 7, we took it over and got 2146 prisoners out, only 1 person was hurt. (0:01:58.8) None of us could let that happen. Men, women, and children were gonna be shot. Same thing here. I live in Plains, Montana. I couldn’t sit and let this happen and not say anything or do anything. Can I do anything? We saved 2146. Like I said before, I would like to make one more jump into Washington, DC. Behind enemy lines. Each one of these officers and every one of our government officials took an oath to uphold the Constitution. That is an oath, a contract, it’s an honor, when the disobey and not uphold the Constitution, it costs every one of us our freedom. It was about freedom at that time, it’s about freedom now (0:02:54.4). I’ll do anything I can to see that we keep freedom in this country. If our life has to be given to keep freedom, what’s the cost? Gotta die some time, let’s die for a cause.

MS1: Up to and including your life. Now how do you feel about this memorial? How many times have you been here? What do you see and feel when you come here?

V2: It’s very impressive. I’d be much more pleased if they had the fountains and everything else open. Apparently our government feels it’s more important to shut down than for us to see it.

MS1: As government shut downs go, this is the first time they’ve stopped people from coming to monuments.

RB: There’s not a good reason for it.

V2: They shut down the wrong part of government, they should have shut down Congress and the President (0:04:03.7).

RB: We fought WW2 so we could have honest elections and so [a few words are garbled] Obama could be elected president. Now he and everybody else has taken all our freedoms and we don’t know who to vote for. No matter who you vote for, they all sell out. That’s our Congress today. They’ve totally sold out.

V2: The main thing this monument represents [a few seconds are garbled]. We had thousands of tanks and ships. I don’t know if we could do that again.

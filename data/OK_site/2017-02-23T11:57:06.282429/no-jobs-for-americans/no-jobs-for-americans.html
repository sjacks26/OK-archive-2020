<p><em>This article was written by Dr. Paul Craig Roberts and originally published at <a href="http://www.paulcraigroberts.org/" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.paulcraigroberts.org/', 'PaulCraigRoberts.org');">PaulCraigRoberts.org</a></em></p>
<p>The alleged recovery took a direct hit from Friday’s payroll jobs   report. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that the economy created   74,000 net new jobs in December.</p>
<p>Wholesale and retail trade  accounted for 70,700 of these jobs or 95.5%.  It is likely that the  December wholesale and retail hires were temporary  for the Christmas  shopping season, which doesn’t seem to have been very  exuberant,  especially in light of Macy’s decision to close five stores  and lay off  2,500 employees. It is a good bet that these December hires  have  already been laid off.</p>
<p>A job gain of 74,000, even if it is  real, is about half of what is  needed to keep the unemployment rate  even with population growth. Yet  the Bureau of Labor Statistics reports  that the unemployment rate fell  from 7.0% to 6.7%. Clearly, this  decline in unemployment was not caused  by the reported 74,000 jobs  gain. The unemployment rate fell, because  Americans unable to find jobs  ceased looking for employment and,  thereby, ceased to be counted as  unemployed.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a>In America the unemployment rate  is a deception just  like everything else. The rate of American  unemployment fell, because  people can’t find jobs. The fewer the jobs,  the lower the unemployment  rate.</p>
<p>I noticed today that the  financial media presstitutes were a bit  hesitant to hype the drop in  the rate of unemployment when there was no  jobs growth to account for  it. The Wall Street and bank economists did  their best to disbelieve  the jobs report as did some of the  bought-and-paid-for academic  economists. Too many interests have a stake  in the non-existent  recovery declared 4.5 years ago to be able to admit  that it is not  really there.</p>
<p>I have been examining the monthly jobs reports for a decade or  longer. I  must say that I am struck by the December report. Normally, a  mainstay  of jobs gain is the category “education and health services,”  with  “ambulatory health care services” adding thousands of jobs. In  December  the net contribution of “education and health services” was  zero, with  “ambulatory health care services” losing 4,100 jobs and  health care  losing 6,000 jobs. If memory serves, this is a first.  Perhaps it  reflects adverse impacts of the ripoff known as Obamacare,  possibly the  worst piece of domestic legislation passed in decades.</p>
<p>I  was also struck by the report that the gain in employment of  waitresses  and bartenders, normally a large percentage of the job gain,  was down  to 9,400 jobs, which were offset by declines elsewhere, such  as the  layoff of local school teachers.</p>
<p>Aren’t Washington’s  priorities wonderful? $1,000 billion per year in  Quantitative Easing,  essentially subsidies for 6 banks “too big to  fail,” and nothing for  school teachers. It should warm every  Republican’s heart.</p>
<p>A  tiny bright spot in the payroll jobs report is 9,000 new manufacturing   jobs. The US manufacturing workforce has declined so dramatically since   jobs offshoring became the policy of American corporations that 9,000   jobs hardly register on the scale. Fabricated metal products, which I   think is roofing metal, accounted for 56% of the manufacturing jobs.   Roofing metal is not an export. Employment in the production of   manufactured products that could be exported, such as “computer and   electronic equipment,” and “electronic instruments” declined by 2,400   and 3,500 respectively.</p>
<p>Clearly, this is not a payroll jobs  report that provides cover for the  looting of the prospects of ordinary  Americans by the financial and  offshoring elites. One can wonder how  the BLS civil servants who  produced it can avoid retribution. It will  be interesting to see what  occurs in the January payroll jobs report.</p>

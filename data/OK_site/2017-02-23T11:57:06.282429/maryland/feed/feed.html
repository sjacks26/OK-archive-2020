<content:encoded>WatchDog,
<p>If you took an Oath to the Constitution as part of becoming a Corrections Officer, then, yes, you can be a full member. If you didn’t, you can still be an Associate Member.</p>

<content:encoded>Several local LEO organizations have been invited to the Oath Keepers summit being held this weekend in Gilbert WV.  I don’t know why a cop hating organization would back OK, but if they do, they must misunderstand the OK organization and miss understand that plenty of active LEOs belong to the OK organization. 
<p>My family fully supports law enforcement and I just provided a two year membership to my father as a gift. He is pro military and pro law enforcement. My husband is retired military and pro law enforcement and he is going to join OK.<br/>
We all know there are bad apples in every agency and business and we know it is our duty to call out corruption where we find it. I also know that I tend to believe the servicemen’s or LEO’s story first, wait for the facts to come out. So, I do have a pro LE bias.<br/>
To your point of you having already broken the OK oaths – the oaths speak of warrantless search and seizers and arrests that would currently be considered unlawful (thus the arrest would not stand up) – I doubt that you any of the arrests, searches or seizers you have made are warrantless or unlawful, thus I don’t believe you have broken the oaths put forth by the organization.<br/>
My apologies that I have droned on and I certainly do not speak for the OK association as a whole, but I wanted to give a voice as someone who’s Father and Husband have/will shortly join.</p>

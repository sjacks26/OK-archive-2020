<p style="text-align: justify;">Testimonial:  My name is Ken Sullivan, I served in the US Coast Guard from March 28, 1976 to Mach 28,1986. I took my oath to defend the Constitution of the United States of America against all enemies foreign and domestic at a recruiters office in Washington DC, our nation’s capital. During this time I was stationed on board USCGC Valiant, after boot camp, then patrolled the Hampton Roads harbor at Norfolk VA. I was transferred to the Marine Safety Office in Baltimore, then to the USCGC Apalachie 61 in the Baltimore Coast Guard yard and patrolled the Chesapeake Bay. Then to a SAR station in Swansboro NC. I was on many SAR missions and many drug operations.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As a veteran, active duty military, or law enforcement officer active or current serving,  (I was all three),  I cannot impress upon you strongly enough exactly what you took an oath for. It was not to serve the military. It as not to serve your police chief.  It was not to serve your commanding officer or mayor, or governor. It was to serve one entity, and only one, the American citizen, and no one else! Yes we have ranks, yes we are expected to lay down our lives for the mission, and yes, we follow orders. BUT ONLY LAWFUL ORDERS! Would you shoot a kid if told to? Of course not! Our oath was to do one thing and only one thing! To protect the American citizen and his or her rights!  THAT IS WHAT THE OATH IS ABOUT FOLKS! Nothing more, or less. It’s just that simple.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So would I disarm a citizen? Of course if he were threatening the lives of others. I might shoot him! But to disarm, detain, or encamp a law abiding American would go against everything I swore SO HELP ME GOD to uphold. I will defend our way of life to my last breath, just as my father Kenneth A Sullivan swore to. Because an oath is not just a bunch of cool words to join a club. I’m a Christian, and when I swear an oath to God, my God, it has a deep meaning that touches my soul! I will never turn my back on the Constitution.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Posse Comitatus Act of 1878 prohibits members of the U.S. armed forces or employees of the U.S. military from enforcing laws on civilians. This law was quietly repealed in 2007 in a private ceremony in the oval office and signed by president George W Bush who, until I learned of this, was my great hero. I understand HIS intentions, but in today’s climate I fear this was a grave mistake. I am asking all who read this to really consider exactly what an oath means to you.</p>
<p>Did ya mean it or were you just tossing out some cool words to join a club?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Because that’s not what it meant. You have or still do, as a military man, or police officer, or firefighter put your very life on the line and been willing to die for those words you swore to. The Constitution of the United States of America. Not some of it. Not parts of it. ALL OF IT! Never disarm America. Never search and seize without a judges order, never unlawfully detain. Or you might as well put a big red star on your hat or swastika on your shoulder. Obey lawful orders unless they are in contradiction to the oath you gave to America. NEVER TURN YOUR BACK ON AMERICANS AS HAPPENED IN NEW ORLEANS! THINK FOR YOUR SELF! Up hold your oath!</p>

Beware of the Commander in Chief that goes too far!<br/>
Public Law 109-364, or the “John Warner Defense Authorization Act of 2007”<br/>
(H.R.5122) (2), which was signed by the commander in chief on October 17th, 2006 George W. Bush, in a private Oval Office ceremony, allows the President to declare a “public emergency” and station troops anywhere in America and take control of state-based National Guard units without the consent of the governor or local authorities, in order to “suppress public disorder.” In order to supress Americans!</p>

<content:encoded>No, the suit would not function with anything heavy materials worn over top of it.

<content:encoded>I will not get too far into this but I do know that the tire tracks of F-16s in Egyptian desert during summer were visible to thermal imaging for hours after the aircraft had made the tracks. Also, the signature of terrain shading made by a now removed aircraft presented telltale evidence of not only that an aircraft had been present but identifying features to allow determination of type aircraft which remained visible for hours afterward.  It was one means to allow aircraft movements to be tracked. 
<p>Perhaps it is a question of scale.  Therefore the question is of what db range is the personal thermal suit effective and not effective.  Example; would a 50 C differentiation between a human body and ambient conditions be too much for the suit to be effective?</p>
<p>Anyway, for several years I have been interested in acquiring a personal thermal suit.  What you have presented is the 1st I have seen of such a suit.  You have my attention.</p>

<content:encoded>My question is about the efficacy of these home grown thermal evasion suits, and what was the test method, how was it conducted, and what instrumentation was used ?   Are they effective  in the rain, over what temperature range was the testing done, what backgrounds were used, etc.   We have seen the amateur scientists cooking up farm boy body armor and their desires to be listed in the Darwin effect bible, and so I am skeptical of this effort.   How bout some test data ?
<p><strong>Associate Editors Note:  I’m not really sure what you mean by “test method”.  You point the thermal device at the suit and if it covers your heat signature, then you are golden. Is this really all that difficult to understand? All thermal imagers operate essentially the same way – some have higher definition (or much higher definition), but there is not a whole lot of difference between the core technology behind a military thermal imager and a handheld consumer FLIR.  If you can hide your heat signature in one thermal unit, then you will be able to hide your thermal signature in ALL thermal units.  </strong></p>
<p>But just to reiterate what I ALREADY mentioned in the video, we tested with multiple consumer grade thermal units and a military grade unit.  For your other questions, go to Snakebitetactical.com and read the FAQ’s, or rewatch the video seeing as you did not pay attention the first time.    </p>
<p>I don’t have an expensive lab to produce peer reviewed materials, however, if you want to build a suit for yourself, then do so (we give you the construction info for FREE, so perhaps you should be grateful rather than dismissive), and then you can produce lab related data to your little heart’s content. I don’t know of anyone testing “farm boy body armor” and failing.  I’ve seen a lot of successful tests of homemade body armor.  Beyond that, what the hell does a hypothetical homemade body armor test failure have to do with a thermal suit that CLEARLY works in multiple conditions and distances on video and why would their obvious lack of relation lead you to be “skeptical”.  Your comment is idiotic.  </p>
<p>Regards,</p>

<content:encoded>See his response to mfhmonkey on youtube.  He states it does not trap the heat but emits it emissivity.

<content:encoded>I am not well versed on thermal suits Mr. Smith. I have seen kids in Pakastan wrapped in aluminum foil and moving around.

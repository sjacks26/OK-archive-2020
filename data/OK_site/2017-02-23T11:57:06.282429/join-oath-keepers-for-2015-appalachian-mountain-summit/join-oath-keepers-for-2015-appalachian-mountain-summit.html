This is an incredible opportunity to meet like minded individuals from your local area and across the country. Join Allen Lardier, Mike Holbrook (summit organizers,) Stewart Rhodes, Founder and President of Oath Keepers, Liberty Musician Jordan Page, and so many more great patriots just like you, from across the country.

<p><strong>A message from Stewart:</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<blockquote><p>This is a critical, emergency summit for veterans and patriots that will draw participants from over a five state area in the Appalachian Mountains. This will be an awesome three day WORKING conference on the weekend of August 28th – 30th. We will break into geographic teams to sit and work together all weekend, then return to their states as teams and get them ready and strong. As with the other state summits Oath Keepers has held in SC and OK, this event will include critical briefings on the security threats this nation faces and what we need to do about it.<br/>
Participants will first be seated and camp together by geographic location.This will facilitate members to introduce themselves to each other and lay out their critical skills and experience. This will allow them to form sub-teams, such as, security (the infantry and police vets), communications (HAM Radio Operators), medical (R.N.’s and EMT’s), engineering (including construction), operations and logistics, intelligence, etc. So, they end up in a big geographical team, with sub-teams of specialists (a Team of Teams!) There will be briefings on the threats we face, ranging from economic to unconventional and how the enemies of the Constitution are using those threats against the American people. This includes how they are attempting to divide and conquer along racial, demographic, economic and cultural lines.<br/>
Once we outline a clear picture of these threats, we will present our recommended solutions and action plans, based on our CPT (Community Preparedness Teams) program and lessons learned in team and community building over the past two years of operations at places like Bundy Ranch, Ferguson, MO, Sugarpine Mine in OR, and Operation Big Sky in Lincoln, MT. Those experiences helped us to further improve our plans to build semi-autonomous, resilient teams in each community. These teams will help the community to unite and provide for their own security, disaster relief, and self reliance during adversity. All of this helps to restore the true militia of the Founders vision. A militia made up of the people themselves, well organized, equipped, and trained, truly is necessary for the security of a free state.<br/>
A critical part of this summit will be showing the participants how to do an area study, providing them an example of an analysis of a town, county and state. They will be given templates and checklists prepared by Sam Culper, of <a href="https://readfomag.com" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'https://readfomag.com', 'The Forward Observer Magazine');" target="_blank" title="The Forward Observer">The Forward Observer Magazine</a>, combined with the input of our Special Forces veterans. They will need to go back to their own geographic location to assess the strengths and weaknesses of their communities, identifying critical needs, and then apply their newly acquired knowledge to answer questions such as: What are the major security threats? What is in place to counter them? What is missing? Is there a constitutional sheriff backed by a real posse? Is there a real militia? Is there a neighborhood watch? What is the condition of their power grid? How resilient is it? How can it be strengthened and protected? How will people’s basic needs be met if it goes down? How many mouths do they have to feed and how much food is on hand? Can their local farms feed the population in a grid down or long term emergency situation?</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The bad guys are assessing all of our strengths and weaknesses (Jade Helm 15.) We must also make those same assessments and take an honest look at our own preparations, in order to better provide for our own security, food, shelter, power, clean water, and medical, etc.<br/>
Please join us, form a team, learn how to build more effective teams, and then go back home as a team. Bring this knowledge home and super-charge the strength of your own community.<br/>
This is what the bad guys DON’T want you to do, so do it!<br/>
See you there,</p>
<p>Stewart Rhodes</p></blockquote>

<content:encoded>Elias, my friend,<br/>
   I think an important distinction is being missed, which is embodied in your use of the following:<br/>
‚Äúthe Democratic principle, i.e., ‚Äúvoting‚Äù.<br/>
   Voting, in and of itself, is not democracy. It is part of a democracy, and it is part of our Constitutional Republic. However, in a democracy the majority RULES. That majority then has force of law. Not so in a Constitutional Republic, in which the majority must stay within the bounds of the Constitution. That difference makes all the difference. 
<p>Voting is not the only part of the democratic principle. Just the limiting of who votes, i.e. adult citizens, is a limitation that is a part of the democratic principle. That our Constitutional Republic has within it certain democratic principles, does not make it a democracy, which is the distinction I am making, which you removed. I would adjust your last sentence to read: ‚ÄúAmerica is a sovereign nation-State Constitutional Republic inside of which functions some of the Democratic principles.‚Äù</p>
<p>You reference voting as being the important principle, but even the Soviet Union had voting. The mere act of voting, without bounds, is democracy in action. That is not what we have, (or at least are meant to have). The voting is bound by the supreme law, which, of course, is the Constitution, the compact between the Sovereign States. </p>
<p>I hope this clears up my position for you. I know we hold similar thoughts on the importance of the Constitution, and it is just this narrow point we disagree on.</p>
<p>Shorty</p>

<content:encoded>But Shorty, do say ‚Äî is not the act of voting an exercise of democracy? Help me out here, Bro. Are you saying that there is no sign of democracy in the formation of the Constitution? Can it not be said that the democratic process functions within our Republic system of law?<br/>
I‚Äôm not arguing, I‚Äôm asking. Please note that I have edited out the sentence in question, have removed it from the article with a notation to read this comment thread below the article. But I do have questions about the preceding statement which I have left in the article, that being:
<p>‚ÄúAmerica is a sovereign nation-State Republic inside of which functions the Democratic principle.‚Äù</p>
<p>Thanks Shorty,<br/>
Salute!<br/>
Elias</p>

<content:encoded>Elias,<br/>
   Words have meaning, n‚Äôest pas? Pretending they mean something other than their intended meaning does a grave disservice to the reader. It is a distortion. War is peace? Freedom is slavery? The distortion of meanings is a trap used by those who would control us. Regardless of your desire to be inclusive, to call our Constitutional Republic a ‚Äúdemocracy in a Republic‚Äù is misleading. Rather than attempting to use words in a different manner to be inclusive, I would suggest you show those Liberals, or Democrats, how the Constitution protects their Rights.

<content:encoded>Junior,<br/>
It seems that I have unintentionally raised a few eyebrows. üòâ
<p> I have seen your video several times over the years and I like it enough to have sent it to my email list several times in past years. Thank you for adding it to this discussion. Also, thank you for reading here, and thank you for leaving your comment.</p>
<p>That said, I would like to explain that I did not intend to imply that the Constitution created a ‚Äúdemocracy‚Äù, not directly. But I would like to explore with you a premise which would state that inadvertently the Constitution does  *in effect* create a democracy in that it provides for voting, for ‚Äúmajority rule‚Äù in limited examples. The act of voting is the democratic process, best as I can see. I am happy to stand corrected if I have made an error in the above article, for my willingness to stand corrected is how this old guy can learn and I value learning the truth over all else. </p>
<p>There are two other considerations too, one of which Cal has noted below. My primary concern in writing this sentence: [It is a Democracy within a Republic, with the Democratic process being both limited and protected by the law of the Republic.] was to be inclusive for all readers here, a number of whom are of the ‚Äúliberal‚Äù persuasion, or consider themselves to be ‚ÄúDemocrats‚Äù. I never want to exclude those readers, and want them to know that here at Oath Keepers we do not discriminate against people based on their political affiliations (although we will disagree with various political philosophies). As Cal has noted below, a lot of Americans do think that ‚ÄúDemocracy‚Äù is the preferred way to describe America, and although they are wrong about that, I do not intend to insult them ‚Äî instead, I prefer to welcome them to this site in hopes they will learn a more Liberty-centric message about our Constitution, i.e., the fact that this country is a Republic. So that was playing around in the back of my mind when I wrote the alarming sentence. As you may well imagine, I walk a very fine line here, and perhaps I was diverging from the purest view of the Constitution with that sentence in brackets, but again, as Cal has noted, I, and Oath Keepers, are keenly aware that this nation was created as a Republic, and that each State is guaranteed by the Constitution to have a Republic form of government. I did not mean in any way to assert that this country is a Democracy. </p>
<p>However, if the Constitution provides for elections-by-vote of the People, is that not the Democratic principle operating under the Republic‚Äôs system of law? And did not the Constitution create that?</p>
<p>So I am apologizing for poor wording, and I have removed that sentence from the above article, but I would like to invite more discussion on this. I hope you return here and offer more input. I also hope others will join in this discussion.</p>
<p>Thanks muchly,<br/>
Salute!<br/>
Elias Alias, editor</p>

<content:encoded>@ Junior, excellent find!  Puts it all into plain language ‚Äì wish we could get all Americans to watch it.
<p>Elias knows that the USA is a Constitutional republic, and is not a democracy.  Because we do have some ‚Äúdemocratic‚Äù processes within our republic such as the way we vote (except at this time and for the last 50 years or so it has really been Election Fraud, instead of our voice), is how so many think of the USA as a ‚Äúdemocracy‚Äù.</p>

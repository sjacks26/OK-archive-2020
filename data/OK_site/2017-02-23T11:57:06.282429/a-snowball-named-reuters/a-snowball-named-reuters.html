<p>Tuesday, August 11, 2015, was quite the day for Oath Keepers.  On Monday the 10th, four of our members had served as body guards at Ferguson, Missouri, for a news crew from InfoWars dot com. The whole of the Oath Keepers organization did not pile in and clog the streets. Only four Oath Keepers were working that detail, as a favor to journalists who were concerned about their safety.</p>
<p>I say, “only four”, just to denote that the organization did not muster forces for another security detail. The four were acting locally, at the request of InfoWars, and were doing so because there had already been trouble for some journalists in Ferguson. I say, “only four”, but that is not to understate the highly professional work our four Oath Keepers did there. Oath Keepers national is proud of the quiet professionalism, cool-headed methodology, and expert deportment of those four Missouri Oath Keepers.</p>
<p>Led by Sam Andrews, these brave men carried out their mission, and the journalists they were guarding were kept safe in the midst of yet another Ferguson, Missouri, riot. At the core of Sam’s and his pals’ mission were journalists, so let’s talk a bit about journalism in America. I would like to share something from the  U.S. Congressional Record of February 9, 1917, page 2947.  One may search for this quite easily and bring up many results, but I like the simplicity of how the good folks over at <a href="http://www.mindfully.org/Reform/Morgan-Buys-Newspapers9feb17.htm" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.mindfully.org/Reform/Morgan-Buys-Newspapers9feb17.htm', 'Mindfully.org ');" target="_blank"><em><strong>Mindfully.org</strong> </em></a>posted it.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">____________________</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>The CHAIRMAN</strong>: The Chair will recognize the gentleman from Texas, a member of the [defense appropriations] committee.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Mr. CALLAWAY</strong>: Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent to insert in the Record a statement that I have of how the newspapers of this country have been handled by the munitions manufacturers.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>The CHAIRMAN</strong>: The gentleman from Texas asks unanimous consent to extend his remarks in the Record by inserting a certain statement. Is there any objection?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Mr. MANN:</strong> Mr. Chairman, reserving the right to object, may I ask whether it is the gentleman’s purpose to insert a long list of extracts from newspapers?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Mr. CALLAWAY</strong>: No; it will be a little, short statement not over 2 ½ inches in length in the Record.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>The CHAIRMAN</strong>: Is there any objection?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>There was no objection.</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Mr. CALLAWAY</strong>: Mr. Chairman, under unanimous consent, I insert into the Record at this point a statement showing the newspaper combination, which explains their activity in the war matter, just discussed by the gentleman from Pennsylvania [Mr. MOORE]:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">“In March, 1915, the J.P. Morgan interests, the steel, ship building and powder interests and their subsidiary organizations, got together 12 men high up in the newspaper world and employed them to select the most influential newspapers in the United States and sufficient number of them to control generally the policy of the daily press in the United States.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">“These 12 men worked the problems out by selecting 179 newspapers, and then began, by an elimination process, to retain only those necessary for the purpose of controlling the general policy of the daily press throughout the country. They found it was only necessary to purchase the control of 25 of the greatest papers. The 25 papers were agreed upon; emissaries were sent to purchase the policy, national and international, of these papers; an agreement was reached; the policy of the papers was bought, to be paid for by the month; an editor was furnished for each paper to properly supervise and edit information regarding the questions of preparedness, militarism, financial policies and other things of national and international nature considered vital to the interests of the purchasers.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">“This contract is in existence at the present time, and it accounts for the news columns of the daily press of the country being filled with all sorts of preparedness arguments and misrepresentations as to the present condition of the United States Army and Navy, and the possibility and probability of the United States being attacked by foreign foes.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">“This policy also included the suppression of everything in opposition to the wishes of the interests served. The effectiveness of this scheme has been conclusively demonstrated by the character of the stuff carried in the daily press throughout the country since March, 1915. They have resorted to anything necessary to commercialize public sentiment and sandbag the National Congress into making extravagant and wasteful appropriations for the Army and Navy under false pretense that it was necessary. Their stock argument is that it is ‘patriotism.’ They are playing on every prejudice and passion of the American people.”</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px; text-align: center;">________________________</p>
<p><strong>So we see</strong> that in 1915, one hundred years ago exactly, Mr. J.P. Morgan was inspired to dominate the American press. He wanted to “<em>control generally the policy of the daily press in the United States.</em>”</p>
<p>Wow. Here we have one of the, as John Taylor Gatto calls them, “four great coal powers of the 19th Century”, deciding to use his wealth to buy into the editorship of the American press to a significant degree, sufficient to control the general message put forth in the newspapers around the nation. (The other great coal powers of the 19th Century were Rockefeller, Carnegie, and Ford — all having created the Great Tax Exempt Foundations for the purpose of organizing American society according to the wiles of the ‘Elite’.)</p>
<p>Why would Morgan want to do that? J.P. Morgan, a junior liaison here in America for the Rothschild dynasty of Europe, was already fabulously wealthy.  Yet he had been smitten with idea of leveraging the American press to affect the collective consciousness of the American people. In other words, he saw a way to influence people’s perception so that what the people were thinking was conducive to a desired policy. Let us note that at this time the Federal Reserve System was less than two years old, and America had not yet been committed into World War I, which was already thundering in Europe.  Those are two important parts of the picture.  Precursor to what Dwight D. Eisenhower would later dub “the military-industrial complex”, Morgan’s “interests” as one of this nation’s most prosperous banking concerns was to insulate a perpetual market for the arms industry, prior to creating the public perception necessary for the consensus President Woodrow Wilson would call upon when sending this unwitting nation into the hell of World War I.  War would be good for the banking game, and it also would be profitable in terms of “political capital” in Washington D.C. Morgan could finance (for an interest charge) an uptick in war materials production, while the political machinery could concentrate and centralize executive power at the White House, which was itself the reason Wall Street (and Edward Mandell House) had groomed for and placed within the White House President Woodrow Wilson.</p>
<p>America’s newspapers were to prepare the way. It was a psychological operation from the get-go. And, as always, the American people bought it. We were dragged reluctantly into WWI and the fat cats of monopoly capitalism danced to the bank on the backs of the common folks’ husbands, fathers, and sons who answered the call to arms by a complicit government. Well, that was then, and this is now.</p>
<p>I share these musings with the reader because late last night, in the wee early hours of pre-dawn Tuesday, August 11, 2015, I came across a “news” article at the Reuters website. (As your friendly editor, I have to read tons of stuff every day, yes?) This article at Reuters was not very friendly to Oath Keepers, but there is more to it than that. Before we look  into Reuters’ handiwork, let’s set the standard of truth regarding our guys in Ferguson. To do so, here is an excellent interview of Sam Andrews by Jason Van Tatenhove, Oath Keepers video and public relations specialist. After viewing this video, compare the news coverages I’ve listed below, and draw your conclusion about the obvious.</p>
<div class="video-container">

</div>
<p>I have seen how a small clump of snow, when rolled downhill on a wintry mountainside, can start an avalanche. That is an apt metaphor for what Reuters has just done. Here is the link to their lead story.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/08/11/us-usa-ferguson-oath-keepers-idUSKCN0QG0SG20150811" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/08/11/us-usa-ferguson-oath-keepers-idUSKCN0QG0SG20150811', 'http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/08/11/us-usa-ferguson-oath-keepers-idUSKCN0QG0SG20150811');" target="_blank"><em><strong>http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/08/11/us-usa-ferguson-oath-keepers-idUSKCN0QG0SG20150811</strong></em></a></p>
<p>Scott Malone did the deed. The headline looks like this:</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Heavily armed ‘Oath Keepers’ inject disquieting element in Ferguson</strong></h2>
<p>That article was the “snowball”. I’m not sure how one could say anyone could “inject disquieting element” into a darned riot — seems to me that a riot is already full-blown “<em>disquietness</em>“, yes? But for Reuters it was easy to figure that four armed men in the midst of the riot threw the whole party into disarray. The mountainside down which the Reuters snowball was frivolously tossed was the great abiding Racial Divide which has been engineered by the media and press for a hundred years.  Just as J.P. Morgan’s twenty-five editorships in 1915 paved the way for a duped American public to put up with the insanity of going to war in Europe, this article by Reuters has shouted slander against Oath Keepers from its peak position in the news world, and it’s echo is now ringing through the hills and valleys across the nation into everyone’s local newspaper, or at anyone’s online news source.  Carelessly, Scott Malone issued the “license” for junior news outlets to exaggerate with little need for imagination.</p>
<p>He was inspired, from out of the blue it would seem, to publish a silly, unfounded, and treacherously-defamatory statement about Oath Keepers which he must have stumbled upon at the SPLC (Southern Poverty Law Center). Here is their contribution –</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><em><strong>The Southern Poverty Law Center, a non-profit civil rights organization, has described the “Oath Keepers” as a “fiercely anti-government, militaristic group,”….</strong></em></p>
<p>I am guessing here, but apparently the SPLC has never considered that Oath Keepers might be one of the most “pro-government” groups in America, which is obvious to we who believe that the Constitution is the highest law of the land. SPLC shall some day realize that Oath Keepers is not “anti-government”, but is instead “<em>anti-criminality-in-government</em>.” We want the damned government to obey its own founding legal charter. That is totally “pro-government”, yet SPLC refuses to consider that sort of logic. And while we’re here, let’s note:  For some reason, our name has to be enclosed now in quotation marks, the very subconscious trick the SPLC does with the word “Patriot”. Notice below how that meme is picked up and carried by many junior news articles as an echo to the Reuters clarion call. But also notice how articles across the nation generally, with few exceptions, simply parrot the main points of the Reuters article, mimicking the tone, mood, color, jist, and attitude Reuters offered them.</p>
<p><strong>  Examples:</strong></p>
<p>FOX NEWS kept the SPLC tirade out of their coverage, but heralded Chief Belmar’s resentment that ordinary citizens would dare offer help to keep the peace. (Recall, Oath Keepers exposed him last year as a Federal stooge, so he’s a bit miffed at us.)</p>

<h3 style="text-align: center;">Presence of militia-style group in Ferguson questioned</h3>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><strong>Quoting: </strong> In the midst of a spasm of tension in Ferguson, Missouri, on the one-year anniversary of the shooting death of 18-year-old Michael Brown, several heavily armed men carrying assault rifles and flak jackets appeared, and they weren’t cops….One member of the militia-style group described the Oath Keepers as constitutionalists…. They come from what was a general rise in sometimes-violent anti-government activity in the Inland Northwest. After a lull following the demise of the Idaho-based neo-Nazi Aryan Nations in 2000, anti-government and white supremacist groups and individuals saw a dramatic uptick in activity and organization. The Oath Keepers appear to still be active in multiple parts of the country. Last week, they were among several similar groups involved in a dispute in Montana over a mining claim.</p>

<p>–</p>
<p><strong>To give credit where credit is due,</strong> the Washington Post  has published the most objective coverage (among the mainstream press) of the Oath Keepers presence in Ferguson on Tuesday: They did parrot some of the common memes, and referred to us as a “militia”, which is of course totally untrue, but they also gave readers a look at the bright side of Oath Keepers, and even published three videos showing our guys visiting with black citizens and talking about today’s problems in general. You’ll want to watch those videos, at the link below this headline.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Who are the Oath Keepers, and why has the armed group returned to Ferguson?</strong></h3>

<p>Quoting the two predominant anti-Oath Keepers memes:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">Citizen militia group returns to Ferguson</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">The Southern Poverty Law Center, however, describes the Oath Keepers as a “fiercely antigovernment, militaristic group.”</p>

<h3 style="text-align: center;">Oath Keepers return to Ferguson, fueling racial tension</h3>
<p>–</p>
<p>There is an endless list of published articles spreading the basic memes of the original Reuters article. Having viewed the video above on this page, we now can see how propaganda persistently pumped through the public press is literally designed to forge perceptions of the national collective consciousness. For the most part, the establishment’s press happily defames Oath Keepers by posting half-truths, outright lies, exaggerations, spin and distortion. Just as the J.P. Morgan conspiracy of 1915 had a goal, I think it is apparent that someone atop the pyramid of the power of the press may be deliberately using the network of media/press to deny the truth about Oath Keepers and to plant subliminal suspicions about Oath Keepers in the public mind. It’s almost as if somebody at the apex of public policy in America doesn’t want Oath Keepers to have a snowball’s chance in Hell.</p>
<p>To their chagrin, Oath Keepers is experiencing a boom in new memberships as people see through the treachery of biased press coverage. People like Sam and his pals in the Missouri Oath Keepers chapter stand tall through the storm, and Oath Keepers national is proud of them and the good work they do.</p>

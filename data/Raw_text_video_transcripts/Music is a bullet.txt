## Jason van Tatenhove with Jordan Page
## Appalachian Summit in WV in 2015

JP: I’ve been playing music a long time. Got a calling to do this professional in my 20s. (0:01:18.5). At 26, had a spiritual, middle of the night experience that changed my life, wrote a song called “Pendulum.” I didn’t understand that song, because I was politically illiterate, I was handed this song in the middle of the night. Eventually connected with Ron Paul and did events with him.

JVT: How did you connect with him?

JP: We appeared at the same events a few times. Started doing events for his campaign in 2010. Message of music is personal freedom, liberty. Politics is “entertainment for slaves” (0:03:24.2). “I’m a huge supporter of Oath Keepers” (0:03:40.1).

JVT: How did you hear about OK?

JP: I met Rhodes in 2009 at Freedom Summit in Phoenix, AZ, another event with Ron Paul. Stewart and I clicked immediately. I’ve worn OK hats at every show I’ve done since 2009. “I did not serve in the military but I’m serving the country in a different way” (0:04:26.9). My message is always personal liberty. I’m anti-war. I’m pro-peace. I’m pro-sound-money. “I’m against fascism, communism, socialism, all the ism’s” (0:04:45.0).

JP: “I collect conspiracy theories, they’re lots of fun” (0:05:36.1). “If you’re not willing to accept information that contradicts your worldview, then your worldview’s gonna end up being pretty narrow and not encompassing very much.”

JP: Rabbit Hole song: I put out a call on FB for people to send me their favorite conspiracy theories, govt operations, and secret societies. Got a ton of info, 80% of which I had already researched or at least heard of. The lines I wrote for the hook are kinda scary. Shows the breadth of corruption worldwide, how sick and depraved people are who are in charge (0:07:58.9). People might not know a lot of the terms in the song, but they can google it. There’s so much here, “it can’t all be made it, there’s gotta be some truth here” (0:08:44.8).
## sigh

JP: There are enough references in this song to different accusations, things like chemtrails (Indigo Skyfall). I just want people to research the terms and come to their own conclusions.

JP: Arm Yourselves song tells the story of the resistance movement in America. It’s a prophetic song (0:10:37.2). The system is unsustainable and is coming to a screeching halt. People aren’t prepared. “The police state hammer will come crashing down on all of us” (0:11:01.2). Arm Yourselves tells the story of resistance. Rhodes and I are doing a GoFundMe campaign to record the song and make a music video, which will feature OK members from Sugar Pine Mine and Bundy Ranch. There are two songs: Arm Yourselves and Act 3. Act 3 is the instrumental battle scene, musical representation of the battle between the people and the state. We’re gonna use the song for outreach to troops on bases across the country, we’re gonna do a DVD outreach (0:14:35.7) and push it with gun rights groups.

JP: Get your affairs in order. Get ready. We all need to be thinking about the future. There are things coming that no one is prepared for.

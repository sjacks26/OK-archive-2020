<p><em>This article was written by Joshua Krause and originally published at <a href="http://www.thedailysheeple.com/university-of-portland-report-incidents-of-discomfort-to-campus-police_022016" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.thedailysheeple.com/university-of-portland-report-incidents-of-discomfort-to-campus-police_022016', 'The Daily Sheeple');">The Daily Sheeple</a></em></p>
<p>The politically correct culture on our college campuses is already obnoxious, absurd, and sometimes downright insane. But believe it or not, it’s still possible for this culture to degenerate further, and reach new lengths of stupidity. If anything, the University of Portland has done just that.</p>
<p>The private Catholic school has just launched the “Speak Up” webpage, which implores students to report <em>“alleged incidents of discrimination and incidents of discomfort regarding observed or experienced interactions of intolerance,”</em> to their Public Safety Department. In other words, the University of Portland wants their students to call the cops whenever someone offends them.</p>
<p>The school’s director of communications and marketing, Rachel Barry-Arquit, explained that <em>“The creation of this web-page reflects our desire to create a welcoming community for everyone. Campus safety is simply one of the many resources available and would be up to the discretion of the individual as to whether public safety needed to be involved.”</em> She admitted that the term ‘incidents of discomfort’ was deliberately vague, so it would include a wide variety of students and situations, and she told the campus newspaper that Speak Up was designed to combat microaggressions on campus.</p>
<p>Let this be a warning to every American who is receptive to political correctness. The people who are pushing this agenda aren’t just determined to shame, ostracize, and criticize people who refuse to stoop to their culture-destroying sensitivity. If they had their way, they would do away with free speech, and use the police to force their PC ideology on society.</p>

<p><strong>Carl Anderson:</strong></p>
<p>Testimonial: I Carl Edward Anderson swear on my family’s name to keep and defend the constitution of the united states ageist all enemies, both foreign and domestic,  so help me god.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">—————————————————-</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="../wp-content/uploads/2015/02/DeptOfNavy-440x300.png"><img alt="DeptOfNavy-440x300" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5219" height="300" src="../wp-content/uploads/2015/02/DeptOfNavy-440x300.png" width="440"/></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Ron:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Testimonial: I Ronald J. Towles swear to GOD as my witness, to uphold and protect the CONSTITUTION of the UNITED STATES OF AMERICA against all enemies foreign and domestic, and I also swear to that same GOD,to also pledge to protect the American citizen under the CONSTITUTION,BILL OF RIGHTS,and the DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE from oppression and suppression.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The CONSTITUTION is a living document from its birth to its present day. It is like the BIBLE, one must not take away or add to it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I knew this at the time when I was sworn in at the recruiting station at Butte, Montana, when I joined the armed forces on Oct.19,1973. Yes, I proudly joined the great UNITED STATES NAVY. Like some people we know, and one who comes to my mind is Bill O’Reilly, a talk show host and prior teacher, who apparently beleives that it is okay to temporarily side step the CONSTITUTION for the sole purpose of accommodating the feelings or emotions of a few. He is a man in the lime light that does not know or understand what/why the CONSTITUTION was written.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There are many people who are in places of power who have no clue what they are saying and it can be very devastating to the UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. There are many remarks such as this that was said by Bill O’Reilly quote “It was okay to disarm the citizens of New Orleans,LA. during Katrina”. Remarks such as these are being made with, or without, thought and/or common sense and of no knowledge of what our forefathers were trying to do, and give us, as citizens, under the CONSTITUTION.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">May GOD the father of our savior JESUS CHRIST bless this GREAT NATION of the UNITED STATES OF AMERICA and may we be a blessing to that same GOD amen.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Now a little about myself. I am 57 years old and a GOD fearing man. A Veitnam veteran from Oct.19,1973 thru Oct.10,1977. I served in the UNITED STATES NAVY as a FTG3 class. I am from a variety of family military men. One of my uncles served in the UNITED STATES NAVY during that great war WWII. He was one of 6 who survived a Kamikaze attack on his ship, in the Pacific theater.<br/>
My dad, also in the UNITED STATES NAVY, served during the Korean war conflict. He was a BT1 and, at time he received his advancement, he was the youngest BT1 on the west coast.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I also have some older cousins that served in other military branches of the armed forces during war and peace time. I have a cousin that served in the UNITED STATES AIR FORCE during Vietnam and his brother served in the UNITED STATES NAVY on one of our AIR CRAFT CARRIERS. I also have a cousin who served in the UNITED STATES ARMY and fought against the VC and has some physical disabilities due to that war. I have a nephew who I am very proud of who served in the UNITED STATES MARINE CORPS in Afghanistan.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I, as a veteran, am about to conclude my testimony in saying that I am very proud of my military family that stood up to plate to serve their country and to uphold and protect the CONSTITUTION from foreign and domestic enemies. I am very blessed in saying, with tears in my heart and eyes, that we all are very fortunate and blessed to make it home safe and secure and were able to serve our GREAT NATION with dignity and honor. And now, to those who gave their all for their country in the protection of the CONSTITUTION of the UNITED STATES OF AMERICA and people there of. To the men, women, and famlies who made the ultimate sacrifice, GOD BLESS them all that the greatest honor might be given them for their loss of life and sacrifice of shed blood for this great country on GODS green planet. Thank you for the OATH KEEPERS.  GOD BLESS each and everyone of you in what you do so unselfishly for this GREAT UNITED STATES OF AMERICA in keeping us informed of the protections of the CONSTITUTION. If I may quote one writer, Glenn of Maine who wrote:  “We must all be OATH KEEPERS if we are to survive SO GIVE ME LIBERTY OR GIVE ME DEATH”. So I, as an oath keeper, shall die with diginity and honor for the protection of the CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. As the late great Charleton Heston said during a NRA convention quote “THE ONLY WAY THAT THEY WILL GET MY GUNS IS TO PRY THEM FROM MY COLD DEAD HANDS”.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Rick Sowell:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Testimonial: I grew up in a very patriotic extended family in the 60’s and 70’s in East Texas. Most of the men in my family had served in WW1, WW2, Korea or Vietnam.  Many members of the family would gather on Sunday afternoons and discuss current affairs, politics and the weather as many were ranchers or farmers. Invariably the conversation would turn to the current political situation (the Vietnam War) and the political climate of the country. The overwhelming consensus was that America was established as a Christian nation with our God given rights enumerated in the constitution and that communism/socialism was a threat to that ideal. The ideal was that Americans opposed to communism were carrying the torch that was lit by our forefathers.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">My family was involved in settling and founding this nation and that was something that was not lost on the generation that lived during the great war and the depression. The principles of freedom and our bill of rights was most certainly of paramount importance to these great men. I was told directly that the agents of socialism were actively attempting to undermine our nation by attacking the core principles that our nation was founded upon. I knew that my task was to pick up the torch and carry it as long as I was able.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I joined the military during my junior year in High School and took the oath to uphold and defend the constitution for the rest of my life. I served in the 82nd Airborne Division and the 4th ID as an Infantryman, was separated from service in 1991 due to a service connected disability incurred in the line of duty. I had planned to serve and retire from the military, not as a job, but out of a sense of duty.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It is obvious to me that the agents of socialism are rapidly gaining ground through manipulation of the social consciousness via the media and our educational system. The degradation of patriotism and our rights during the last 15-20 years has generated great concern on my part. I have been and am becoming more concerned of late with respect to the direction that our country is heading. I hereby reaffirm my oath and stand ready to do whatever is necessary to uphold our constitution and defend America against all enemies foreign and domestic. I believe in the constitution as it was written and the rule of law. I support our law enforcement community and our patriotic citizens but believe that forces are actively working to destroy our nation as it was intended by our founders. I am thankful that Stewart founded Oath Keepers as an organization intended to defend our constitution and therefore America. As Oath Keepers, we must make whatever sacrifices are necessary to protect this great nation.</p>
<p>Rick</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>wyodoc:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Testimonial: I’m just a man. A husband. A father. An American. Several times in my life I raised my hand and swore an oath to my God to defend a piece of paper. A very important piece of paper that I place second only to the Bible in importance.  My service was unremarkable and my life has only been remarkable for screwing it up.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I’ve been a lousy husband and a lousy father. But I intend to be an awesome Oathkeeper!</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="https://www.oathkeepers.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Joseph-Forrest.jpg"><img alt="Joseph Forrest" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5697" height="350" src="https://www.oathkeepers.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Joseph-Forrest.jpg" width="350"/></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Joseph Forrest:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Testimonial:  I joined the service in April 2001. Of course you know what happened a few short months later. The terrorist acts of 9/11 were terrible. The way that our leadership has used these acts to suppress liberty and justice is completely intolerable. I said an oath to support and defend our Constitution against enemies both foreign and domestic. Today, we have more enemies than we can imagine and every one of them seem to be sitting in positions of power in Washington, D.C.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As a man who took an oath to defend the Constitution, I swear on my life to uphold the following:</p>
<p>I will NEVER obey an order to disarm an American citizen.</p>
<p>I will NEVER support or conduct warrant-less searches.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I will NEVER obey an order to detain American citizens as “unlawful enemy combatants” or to subject them to trial by military tribunal.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I will NEVER obey orders to impose martial law or a “state of emergency” on a state, or to enter with force into a state, without the express consent and invitation of that state’s legislature and governor.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I will NEVER obey orders to invade and subjugate any state that asserts its sovereignty and declares the national government to be in violation of the compact by which that state entered the Union.</p>
<p>I will NEVER obey any order to blockade American cities.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I will NEVER obey any order to force American citizens into any form of detention camps under any pretext.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I will NEVER obey orders to assist or support the use of any foreign troops on U.S. soil against the American people to “keep the peace” or to “maintain control” during any emergency, or under any other pretext. We will consider such use of foreign troops against our people to be an invasion and an act of war.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I will NEVER obey any orders to confiscate the property of the American people, including food and other essential supplies, under any emergency pretext whatsoever.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I will NEVER obey any orders which infringe on the right of the people to free speech, to peaceably assemble, and to petition their government for a redress of grievances.</p>
<p>So help me God.</p>

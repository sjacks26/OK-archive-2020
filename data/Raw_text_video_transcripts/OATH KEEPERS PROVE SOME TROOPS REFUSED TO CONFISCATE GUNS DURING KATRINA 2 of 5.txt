JM: Why are active duty guys here? That’s not their mission. We discussed that a little bit. I know we didn’t have control over it, the President and everybody else has taken control, we just have to do what we’re told. I said I’ll do what I’m told up to a point.
 SR: What elements had you heard were there besides the 82nd.

JM: We heard rumors that had some plainclothes SF guys in the French Quarter. That made me really nervous. I can understand why they would want that, but you have plainclothes cops, let them do it. Keep the Special Forces guys doing their mission, training insurgent groups in other areas. Leave us alone.

SR: Let the Guard handle it.

JM: That’s right. Leave the Guard to it. That’s our job.

SR: What did they have you doing there in New Orleans?

JM: (0:00:44.5) Same thing. Roving patrols, static patrols around hospitals and government buildings. Roving patrols is what I usually did, I did a couple of statics. That was really boring.

SR: As part of the roving patrols, you had an encounter with an ex-Airborne guy, right?

JM: Yeah, part of our job. The curfew was still on, at 2200. Part of the job for my team was going around and closing bars at curfew time. So we’d go around 15 minutes early and make sure everyone knew the bar was closing. And they would say yea yeah. No one was allowed on the streets. We worked with them and said if anybody stays after that, you need to lock your doors and not let them out. If they’re out afterward, we had an obligation to call the police. That’s what they’ve put out here. I was more okay with that than taking guns, so I said I’ll work the curfew, but I’m not touching firearms.

JM: (0:01:42.0) One of the first places we went into was Cooter Browns. We walked in, as soon as we entered the door, I guess he hadn’t had a lot of National Guardsmen there. When we walked through, the owner turned around and said I heard you guys were coming. Are you here for my guns? We’re not here for your guns. Good cause you’re not getting them. We’re not here for your guns, we’re just telling you the bar is supposed to close at 10 for the curfew, nobody out on the streets. He said yeah I understand that. After he found out we weren’t there for his guns, he said good. He had his shirt untucked, he pulled it up and tucked it back in, he had his 1911 on his hip. (0:02:22.0) He goes, as long as you’re not here for them, that’s fine. We found out they had some more. Because there was a criminal element in New Orleans. They had to defend themselves. The guy behind the bar moved some boxes, he had an AR on the shelf. Me being a gun guy, I was like good deal. And I told them, that’s not our job, we’re not here to take them. I actually told him, if they tell me I have to, I’m not going to.

SR: What did he say to that?

JM: Good. And that’s when I found out he was an Airborne guy, did I think 6 years active duty Airbone. We talked to the Constitution, old war stories, army stories. He actually became one of our good contacts. He stayed in the city through the whole thing. He knew if he left, the criminal element would come in and take everything he had. So he stayed, just got up in the second floor of his house. He was involved in a lot of cleanup. So he became one of the first guys we would go see, say we’ve been hearing rumors about this, what do you know? And he gave us a lot of good information.

SR: About gangs?

JM: About gangs coming back in. (0:03:33.9) Once the gangs found out that this was a bad place to be, they left. But then they figured, nobody’s there, let’s go back. There were rumors they would come in with automatic weapons. The police force was scared. We were issued IBAs, ballistic armor and stuff. Wore our kevlars sometimes when it was really bad. We saw people that were most likely with the criminal element. They were roaming around in big packs, scouting things out. But we never had issues with them.

SR: Local folks like this gentleman were guarding their own property? (0:04:09.5)

JM: Oh yeah.

SR: Do you know, besides the Utah Guard. Basically the whole Utah Guard, it’s safe to say they refused to participate and confiscate?

JM: I’d say a large majority were on board with that. I know some of them, a lot of times, especially when you’re thinking about your military career, a lot of guys say they’re on board then might waiver a bit. But I think we had a big enough group that they would have stepped behind and said we’re with this group. 

SR: Kind of like a tipping point.

JM: It is. Especially in MI, there are so many aspects of that group, you worry about a lot of things.

SR: Your clearance, it’s a big deal.

JM: Yeah. Talking right now, in the back of my head I’m going, wow am I going to get in trouble for this? But I think it has to be told, that the government was in there doing these things and telling us – not us, not our group particularly – but there were other units that were actually involved with law enforcement getting guns out of there without warrants. I think it’s that important, people need to know, I was there I saw it.

SR: It’s more important that they understand that there were people there who refused and would not have participated. It’s safe to say that half your company would have stood down?

JM: (0:05:31.5) Absolutely. I know for a fact that the guys in formation right around me, our platoon, they wouldn’t do it, and we only had 2 platoons. I’d say 99% of our platoon were completely on board with no we’re not doing it. 

SR: What about, did you guys hear about other elements that refused or let it be known they would not participate? Outside of the Utah Guard.

JM: We didn’t. We didn’t hear much about other units and what they were doing, outside of the 82nd patrolling the French Quarter and the SF guys supposedly around in plainclothes. They’re the guys that would bust you, because we weren’t allowed in the French Quarter. We heard about it, those plainclothes guys will bust you if you go down there. They know what to look for, we were in uniform. Outside of that, I didn’t hear of any there and I haven’t heard of any since.

SR: What’s interesting, though, is that I didn’t know about this. We didn’t know about your unit and what you said. Now we have to start looking around. We hear all the time, it’s a good example of how, it can’t happen here it has to happen here, happened in New Orleans. But we also hear from people, how come no one stood up? People think the military is just going to follow orders, look at New Orleans. No one refused, everyone went along. That’s not the case.

JM: (0:06:59.3) And I can tell you this. Of the units I knew were there, and I didn’t go talk to the other units, I bumped into some other folks. The units I know were there were Texas, Arkansas, Alabama, and Florida. I can almost guarantee 3 of those 4 were saying we’re not touching our citizens’ guns. I can’t tell you for sure cause I didn’t get into it with them. I’d bump into them, see there patch, hey where are you from? I’m from Texas. We didn’t actually talk about it. But if you’re a Texas Guardsman, you’re probably going to say I’m not touching some guy’s guns. It can’t just be a Utah thing. When you’re talking about those four states, you know that, Florida has great gun laws I think, Texas great gun laws. They’re all

SR: It’s a gun culture

JM: (0:07:45.8) Yeah. They believe in 2A. They’re not going to trespass on these people and take their guns. I have to believe that we weren’t the only ones. But I don’t have any proof.

SR: Do you think that the fact that you went in and did a preemptive stand to your commander, did that influence whether your unit was given orders to do anything?

JM: I like to think so, the fact that we stood up and said we aren’t going to do this at least put in the back of their head, hey if certain orders come down, we have to put up a fight and say our guys aren’t going to do this. Whether we believe in it or not as a commander, our guys don’t, so maybe we should put a little fight into it.

SR: What did your commander have to say? (0:08:34.4)

JM: Again

SR: You don’t want to put him on the spot

JM: Being a commander, there’s a lot more involved than being an enlisted guy. An enlisted guy, we can pretty much say what we need to say, and they go okay don’t say that anymore or else. Commanders and things, especially when you get to certain levels, there’s a lot more politics involved. They can’t actually say the things they want to. Now I didn’t know him that well, it was a task force brought together, he was from a different unit than me, I’ve never deployed with him or trained with him. When we said that, it wasn’t like oh you better do what you’re told, which is the response I would think I would get if he disagreed with my stance. The fact that he said don’t worry we’re not going to do that.

SR: He didn’t say I’m with you guys.

JM: In his position, he really can’t. That can jeopardize his career, his command, a lot of things. From his standpoint, I don’t think he can say that. But I want to believe that he would have if he had been an E-5 like me at the time or an E-6. I would like to believe he would have stood up and said I’m with you guys. In the reaction I got from him, instead of him saying I’m your commander you’ll do what I tell you to, he kind of went don’t worry we’re not doing that.

SR: Interesting. So you don’t really know where he stood, but your guess is he was in agreement.

JM: Yeah, it’s hard to say. I know he went to the task force commander, there were reports of him going to the task force commander and saying we don’t want to be involved in that.

SR: Which was a colonel correct?

JM: Yeah. 
 SR: Your commander was a Major

JM: Yes. He went to an O-6 colonel and said we don’t want to be involved in this. That was filtered down through people who were at the meeting, it got back to us. He can’t say it, but we think he’s on our side.

SR: What was the scuttlebutt as far as the response from the colonel?

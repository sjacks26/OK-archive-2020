<content:encoded>Editor thank you for your response and questions. I will try to provide a brief answer or two but let me first say my intent is not to insult anyone- merely to find out more and express my concerns. Sort of related to another one of those amendments we all appreciate. As to the questions: I came to the site to learn more about the people who came here with guns who appear to be prepared to battle with our government and who like it or not are a bit intimidating with guns, camo and are not out for a hunt. Some of the comments that resulted show a few well intended individuals with strong beliefs. However, a few of the comments indicate beliefs that are beyond strong and border on scary, conspiracy and extremist to the majority of folks. My “insult” you mentioned was in response to a poster indicating that I am spitting in the face or those who give a damn and that I should be concerned about becoming a minority. Other comments reflect some unique, if not selective interpretations of the constitution. I am not a constitutional scholar but I can read. Your selections imply that the founding fathers called for a militia that was serving the government- not opposing it (art 2, sec 2, clause 1).  Your own cite goes on to cite reasons such as suppressing insurrection. That sort of sounds like what you are promoting when you take up arms to prevent the forest service (part of our government) from accessing land that the courts will eventually determine ownership of. What is going through the heads of people that show up in Lincoln or Ferguson armed and not under the control of any official group is relevant. Based on the comments I read above and a few isolated incidents where Oath keepers have had legal issues and the fact that gun-toting free lancers are not always under tight control I have a right to be concerned. Concerned is different than nervous. Had your group come in offering press and legal resources to help a friend and not armed patrols my outlook would be different. Yours is not the militia the founders intended- it is not well- regulated or serving the state. There is a place for arms and a strong presence and show of strength. It sure isn’t staring down the forest service in Lincoln MT. It is not my intention to stir up trouble on your site or insult those in your group who may have served with honor. Unfortunately there are always some in the ranks who go a bit farther or would if they had the means. The next Timothy McVeigh, Oliver North or former Lincoln resident Ted Kaczynski has a heck of a lot more in common with your group than they do with the average citizen or go erment employee.That does make me nervous.

<content:encoded>Not sure why the post at 14:52 appears to be from me.It is not. It is however a great example of why I am concerned about who is in my backyard and what is running through their minds.Worried about becoming a minority in my own county? No. I share this country and Americans are welcome. Splitting us up beyond that into ideology or race is wrong. As is the presence of militia with weapons in Lincoln Montana.
<p><strong>–<br/>
[Editor’s Note: If I can carve out the time it will take, I’ll look into the post in question and let you know what happened, if something did happen, and/or if I can learn anything about it. I feel sure that no one on my staff would attempt to impersonate you, so it is likely to be someone from the “outside world”.</strong></p>
<p>On your other concerns, if you do not like the idea of Americans standing up for each other against unlawful government “authorities”, you’re probably reading at the wrong website. We are very strong in our support of the Second Amendment. And we are equally strong in questioning today’s government as to why these items in the U.S. Constitution are nowhere to be seen — </p>
<p><strong>Article I, Section 8, Clauses 15 &amp; 16:</strong><br/>
[The Congress shall have Power To…] </p>
<p>Clause 15: [  ] <em>“To provide for calling forth the Militia to execute the Laws of the Union, suppress Insurrections and repel Invasions;”</em></p>
<p>Clause 16: [  ] <em>“To provide for organizing, arming, and disciplining, the Militia, and for governing such Part of them as may be employed in the Service of the United States, reserving to the States respectively, the Appointment of the Officers, and the Authority of training the Militia according to the discipline prescribed by Congress;”</em></p>
<p><strong>Article II, Section 2, Clause 1:</strong><br/>
<em>“The President shall be Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy of the United States, and of the Militia of the several States, when called into the actual Service of the United States…”</em></p>
<p><strong>That is the highest law of the land, and that is precisely why “the government” is having hissy-fits over the success Oath Keepers is having in reminding Americans about that treasured old document. My question to you is: What is your problem with the Militia? The Highest Law of the Land requires that the several States have their Militia, and the people have the sovereign right to have their lawful Militia, and as you just read above, the damned Federal government is supposed to make sure that the States do have their Militia, that the Militia may be called forth when necessary. So what could your problem actually be, if not the sad condition of being unpatriotic, irresponsible, and a worshiper of Gov over God? </strong></p>
<p>Again, if you are worried about loyal patriotic Americans openly carrying personal defense weapons, you may be reading at the wrong website. I am not condemning your view, but I am questioning your insult, the insult that is implied by your words above,<br/>
<em>“…I am concerned about who is in my backyard and what is running through their minds.”</em></p>
<p>Oath Keepers membership is comprised of mature, experienced, qualified, knowledgeable, inspired and inspiring individual Americans. We have many members of color who have served honorably in the military or on police forces or in Sheriff Departments or firefighter forces. It is downright insulting for you to come here where our members read, and imply that there is something to be worried about when Oath Keepers stand for property rights for one of your good neighbors. I mean, like, really Dude. Be sensitive, yes? I was not at Lincoln, but I’ll bet you a six pack to your six-shooter that not one Oath Keeper’s boot has touched or bent a single blade of grass in your “back yard”. If you’re a nervous type and don’t even like patriots and Constitutionalists in your vicinity, your County, or your State, I’m to deduce soon enough that you will want us out of your Country as well.  Why are you even commenting here? I’m just asking. You are welcome to read here, but I’m curious why you would want to. But whatever your motive for reading here, I’d like to offer you an article to read while you’re here —</p>

<content:encoded>Then you don’t know yet, Murf. What is in your back yard, my back yard is middle eastern invasion, the cousins to each other, ancient machines operating, one 1917 cabal communist federal reserve and the other their cousins. Chasing down certain people for thousands of years. JFK warned us, he got murdered for it a week later. Think of your lineage and their future being made a minority in their own country, not just here but Sweden, UK, Australia, Canada, South Africa, and what do all these countries have in common? And convenient U.N. massive immigration chasing a certain people down to the last one.  The riots and new panther party have been infiltrated by one part of this machine.  In all branches of gov’t.  The same George Washington defended us from, and 1860 Lincoln was one of them. Look up Khazars 740AD claiming to be what they are not yet manipulating the world. New twisted view on a bible meant for gentiles, right? Indoctrination and slaves of a  machine.

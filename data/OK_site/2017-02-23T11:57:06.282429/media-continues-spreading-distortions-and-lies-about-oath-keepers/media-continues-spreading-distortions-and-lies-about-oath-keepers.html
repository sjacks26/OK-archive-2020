Keith Ellison/Facebook timeline photo</p></div>
<p>CNN has added an update to <strong><a href="http://www.cnn.com/2015/10/08/opinions/ellison-islam-america/" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.cnn.com/2015/10/08/opinions/ellison-islam-america/', 'a lying attack piece');" target="_blank">a lying attack piece</a></strong> by U.S. Rep. Keith Ellison and Dalia Mogahed, a Muslim activist and Obama adviser, against Oath Keepers. That said, the brief statement buried in the story’s text, telling readers “A representative of the Oath Keepers contacted us to say that the [Global Rally for Humanity] was not officially sanctioned by them,” hardly undoes the damage done. It also makes no attempt to refute any charges or present the truth.</p>
<p>Ellison, in turn, was citing The Detroit Free Press as his source for parroting a lie attributed to the Anti-Defamation League that “Oath Keepers and Three Percenters [are] extremist anti-government movements.” Imagine that: The Anti-Defamation League defaming. Every time we turn around, we run into more corroboration of the truism that for “progressives,” every day is Opposite Day.</p>
<p><strong><a href="../oath-keepers-did-not-organize-the-global-rally-for-humanity/index.html" target="_blank">Oath Keepers has made its position clear</a></strong>. The organization has nothing to do with the rally. And while some who did may have worn Oath Keepers garb or appropriated the group’s name, it’s CNN’s fundamental obligation  to ensure even guest editorials they issue viewpoint disclaimers for are truthful. But that would mean CNN editors would need to educate themselves on subject matter they accept. And they’d also have to be committed to standards of fairness and accuracy.</p>
<p>Good luck with that.</p>
<p>As for being “extremist,” <strong><a href="http://conservativeamerica-online.com/the-13-leaders-of-the-socialist-movement-in-congress-keith-ellison/" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://conservativeamerica-online.com/the-13-leaders-of-the-socialist-movement-in-congress-keith-ellison/', 'Ellison is one to talk');" target="_blank">Ellison is one to talk</a></strong> (and that will provide fodder for a follow-up column). As for being “anti-government,” leave it to a “progressive” to level that denunciation against American patriots, including current and retired military, law enforcement and  emergency services personnel who have pledged an oath to the Constitution. And he doesn’t stop there.</p>
<p>“The bigotry and hatred championed by groups like the Oath Keepers does not represent the majority of Americans,” Ellison charged, without providing one example to substantiate such an ugly and damning accusation.  In fact, he can’t, and a few minutes on the website would have provided numerous examples of Oath Keepers being just the opposite of how it’s portrayed, as exemplified by some of the videos on <strong><a href="../index.html?p=2923" target="_blank">the website’s “About” page</a></strong>, or this couldn’t-be-clearer section of <strong><a href="../index.html?p=2918" target="_blank">the Bylaws</a></strong>:</p>
<blockquote><p>No person who advocates, or has been or is a member, or associated with, any organization, formal or informal, that advocates discrimination, violence, or hatred toward any person based upon their race, nationality, creed, or color, shall be entitled to be a member or associate member.</p></blockquote>
<p>God forbid the Anti-Defamation League, or The Detroit Free Press, or Rep. Keith Ellison, or CNN should actually do any fact-finding. And if they won’t even visit a website or click on a main tab, what are the chances they would actually try to communicate with a representative of Oath Keepers?</p>
<p>Yeah, I know, CNN, called “Communist News Network” by some who are sick of the constant lies, distortion and bias, and ridiculed by others, who have come to expect inaccuracies to be the norm, as “the most busted name in news.” But even “news” outlets perceived to be more “conservative” show a tendency to accept a leftist narrative without question – case in point, <strong><a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/oct/14/oath-keepers-form-college-chapters-stop-students-c/" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/oct/14/oath-keepers-form-college-chapters-stop-students-c/', 'a report from The Washington Times');" target="_blank">a report from The Washington Times</a></strong>.</p>
<p>‘In the wake of the deadly massacre at an Oregon community college, the controversial Oath Keepers militia group revealed a new plan last week to prevent school shootings, announcing its intention to form college and high school chapters to train students to ‘fight back,’ the story began.</p>
<p>First, the only people who find the purpose of the Oath Keepers to be “controversial” are those who disagree with the proposition that government officials and employees should follow the Constitution.</p>
<p>Second, as has been stressed time and again, and as articulated by Editor Elias Alias, Oath Keepers is <strong><a href="https://www.oathkeepers.org/religious-leader-bears-false-witness-against-oath-keepers/" target="_blank">not a “militia group”</a></strong>:</p>
<blockquote><p>“The reason Oath Keepers is not a Militia is simple — among other considerations, we do not have a command structure, do not assign Militia rank designations or titles, and we are not a division of any State Militia Office, since to the best of my knowledge those no longer exist in modern America. Oath Keepers loves the name “Militia”, but Oath Keepers is not a Militia. We would, however, love to see every State have its Office of the Militia, for we do honor out Oath to the Constitution which requires the Militia. Why else would the SPLC and DHS hate our guts, eh?”</p></blockquote>
<p>Third, what Oath Keepers is proposing with its <strong><a href="../in-wake-of-college-shooting-oath-keepers-to-form-college-chapters-and-train-students-to-fight-back/index.html" target="_blank">college outreach and education program</a></strong> has been <strong><a href="http://www.ammoland.com/2015/10/anti-texas-campus-carry-petition-trips-over-inconvenient-truth/" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.ammoland.com/2015/10/anti-texas-campus-carry-petition-trips-over-inconvenient-truth/', 'proven effective in the real world');" target="_blank">proven effective in the real world</a></strong>, even though “progressives” and their media allies are doing everything they can to spook the uninformed.</p>
<p>Last, what’s with ending the article giving the Southern Poverty Law Center the last word? Why did the “reporter” not see fit to question that?</p>
<p>It’s easy to dismiss all this as just squabbling over words, but there’s a much greater danger, particularly in light of the <strong><a href="http://sipseystreetirregulars.blogspot.com/2015/10/southern-preposterous-lie-centers.html" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://sipseystreetirregulars.blogspot.com/2015/10/southern-preposterous-lie-centers.html', 'Justice Department partnering with SPLC');" target="_blank">Justice Department partnering with SPLC</a></strong> to reshape the narrative so the public believes patriots to be terrorists. Because once the propaganda offensive has sufficiently advanced to where Constitutionalists are equated with ISIS in the public mind, <strong><a href="http://www.wnd.com/2015/10/new-obama-czar-will-hunt-right-wing-extremists/" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.wnd.com/2015/10/new-obama-czar-will-hunt-right-wing-extremists/', 'the enforcement resources');" target="_blank">the enforcement resources</a></strong> will have been put into place to do something about it. And there won’t be Oath Keepers in those ranks.</p>

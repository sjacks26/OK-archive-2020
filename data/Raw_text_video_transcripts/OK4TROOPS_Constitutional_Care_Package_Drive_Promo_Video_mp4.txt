Stewart Rhodes: [00:00:23] This is Stewart Rhodes, founder of Oath Keepers. Those of you who know about Oath keepers, you need no introduction to our mission. For those of you that don't know, the basic mission of Oath keepers is to reach out to all current serving military. all of them took the same oath that I did when I served as a paratrooper, and that oath is to support and defend the Constitution against all enemies foreign and domestic. And our mission is to remind them that their oath is to the Constitution not to any politician. Further we also want to ensure they understand the Constitution they swore to defend. If they don't know the constitution, how can they possibly defend it. So that's our mission, to reach them, teach them, And then inspire them to keep their oath. Now from the very beginning if someone told me hey what will be your best wish, what's the grandest wish you could ever have. I always answered if someone gave me a million bucks is what I would do as I would put a care package in the hand every service member U.S. military, in all the branches. In that care package would be instructions on the oath, on the obligations of the oath, and instructions and education materials on the constitution. So if we had unlimited resources, that's what we'd do, put a care package in the hands of every active duty service member, teach them about the Constitution they swore to defend, remind them that their oath is to the Constitution. And then to give them examples and inspiration to make sure they have the courage to keep their oath. And so we're going to do it. We're not going to wait for someone to give us a million bucks. But we're going to start it right now. And so we're going to do it. one package at a time, 10 at a time or 20 at a time. how successful we are and how fast we go Depends on what you are willing to do to helps. Here's how it's going to work. From November 11, Veterans Day 2009, all the way through to December 15, which is the anniversary of the Bill of Rights. We are going to have our first big drive to put care packages in the hands of current serving military members whether they're stationed here at home or deployed abroad. Doesn't make a difference to us. We're going to reach all that we can between now and the end of the year. This is the first, a first drive. We'll have others as we go forward. This big one, we want to make a success and get as many out there as possible. So we're going to put together packages of Oath Keeper education materials that will wind up in the hands of the current servicemembers. Whenever you donate 20 bucks that will put a package in the hands of a current serving military member. In that packet is gonna be a copy of the Constitution and the declaration of Independence. Like I said before, if they don't know the Constitution, how can they possibly defend it. And they should also know and understand the Declaration of independence which is the nation's birth certificate and a fantastic summary of principles of our republic. they will also get a DVD which will contain some of the speeches from our gathering at Lexington Green on April 19th 2009, but also educational speeches on the obligations of their oath. One of them is going to be by the current serving Naval Commander David Gillie, who gave a fantastic hour long expos√© on the obligations of the oath under Article 6 of the Constitution at our first annual convention. 

David Gillie: [00:03:49] And so when Seaman Gillie receives an unlawful order, It is his place to say. Sir. Why why why are we doing that sir. How are we doing that sir. by virtue of what authority. Respectfully sir. And if it is an admiral or a general doesn't matter. Same thing. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:04:14] Commander Gillie is an outstanding teacher. we think and believe that his instruction on the constitution will square away all the current serving. There will also be inspirational videos and clips in there from other well respected veterans. and also we're going to a handbook, much like the same size of the Constitution packet here. and that will be an oath keepers handbook. You've probably heard of rangers handbooks or special forces handbooks, this will be an Oath Keepers handbook containing written instructions education on the obligations of the oath, making sure they understand that the oath comes from the Constitution itself. It's not just a good idea or a tradition. It's something the founders put in the Constitution requiring of all offices and all levels of government to take an oath to support and defend the constitution. So that will teach them more about the oath, more about the Constitution they swore to defend and give them inspiration to keep that oath. Authors of that handbook will be Commander David Gillie, current serving naval commander, and also retired Special Forces major Rex McTyeire and myself, the three of us will be the principal authors with cameos from other current serving and retired military officers as well. This whole package will also include an Oath Keepers bumper sticker and other neat little Oath Keeper items like that and also a tab. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:05:38] Now we recently had an active duty military member from Iraq send a photo in of his shoulders showing an Oath Keeper tab velcrod on his current, his ACU. This was not a tab that was made by Oath Keepers. This was something that this current serving military member had made for himself. But what we thought it was a pretty good idea, so we're going to make up tabs like that with velcro on the back that can be attached to any ACU uniform. And we're going to send those to all current serving military members as our token of appreciation for them keeping their oath. So the bottom line of this is just like everything else Oath Keepers has done, everything you do can make a big difference. Every time you donate $20, you will know that it's going to put one of these packages into the hands of a current serving military member of the U.S. armed forces. if You don't have money to donate. That's fine. You could give us names, if you have a name and address of a current service member, whether they're friends family. However you happen to know them, you can send in. Now to contribute either the money or the names, you can go to OK4Troops.com. That's the Web site for this initiative, this effort. As I Said every $20 bucks, if you put in $100, That's five packages. We're gonna reach Five current service numbers. or if you give us names. Say you're just flat broke but you know someone current serving in the military, great. Just give us the names and addresses so we can send those packages out to them, we'll do the rest. So whether you're whether you have money or not, it doesn't make a different to us. You can help. now You can also of course donate money and then supply the names that you want the packages sent to names and addresses. Or if you want you can purchase the packages. We'll send you the package, And you put the Oath Keepers package in with the care package you construct for yourself, whatever you want to send them in your own custom care package is fine with us. We'll provide you with the education materials. And you do the rest. So any of the above, whether it's donate money, Names and addresses, both. We'll let you do your own adopt a troop mission and get a care package and send out it out to troops. Go to OK4Troops.com and we'll square you away. 

Stewart Rhodes: [00:07:58] We'd like to see, our dream would be 50000 service numbers with the packet in their hand, ideally by the first of the year. We like to get started on that. The sooner you do it, the more likely they are to get it before Christmas, but even if they get it after Christmas is to be a pretty amazing new year's present to them. to make sure they keep their oath. Time is short. And from the very beginning of Oath Keepers, my mission has been to reach out to those who still have honor and integrity. Make sure they understand the Constitution they swore an oath to defend. This Republic cannot fall without their consent, without their going along and obeying unlawful orders. We are confident that when we reach them and teach them more about the Constitution, they will do what's right. Please join us in this effort And try to reach as many as possible. You never know how far and what impact any One of the things you do can make. Every one of those packages can make a huge difference. So please join us. God save the republic.

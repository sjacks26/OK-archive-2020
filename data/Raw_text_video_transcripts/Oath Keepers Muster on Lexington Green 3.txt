SR: When I first decided to do OK, I knew DF, he worked as a volunteer for Ron Paul’s campaign in Nevada too. When I first told him about OK, because I’m ex-military I was going to focus on ex-military. I figured that, with the times we live in, I’m going to be very focused on where my efforts can do the most good. I thought the best place for me to reinforce devotion to the Constitution was with our troops. But DF reminded me, what about the police? We swore an oath to defend the Constitution, too. (0:00:44.6) He was right. So I told him, guess what, you get to be the national liaison for police. That’s what he gets for volunteering, right? So, without further ado, we’re going to read out our declaration of orders we will not obey. This is what has caused the most firestorm on the internet about OK. We’ve only been around for 6 weeks, it’s bizarre. What are you all doing here!? We issued these orders, they were put together very carefully to reflect the history that our forefathers struggled through, the lessons they learned, that they enshrined in our Bill of Rights, that we are seeing today the same threats. That’s what these are designed to do. We don’t expect everyone to agree with every point we make in these or everything we say. But we do want them to start thinking for themselves and debating for themselves about where their line is. On a spectrum from Michael New refusing to wear a blue beret, which you’ll hear more about in a few minutes. We’ve got a current serving Lt. Cdr. David Gillie is going to tell you about Michael New’s struggle and say something about his own oath. (0:02:00.7) 

SR: But on that spectrum from Michael New all the way to refusing to fire on American citizens resisting attempts to disarm them, that’s a spectrum. Somewhere along that line better be your line in the sand. This one [not firing on Americans] is easy to see. A gross, total disarm of the American people is pretty obvious. Trying to put Americans in concentration camps is pretty obvious, right? That should be clear, I don’t want to take it for granted, though. I want troops to think about these things in advance. One thing we learned from Katrina, hopefully next time it won’t go down like that because they’ll have thought about it ahead of time. (0:02:34.4). That’s our mission. On that spectrum, each man has to make a decision for himself about where that line is. We’ve already seen some discussions on the internet. There are discussions forums about OK, I go and kinda spy on them. They’re saying what about this what about that? They’re going back and forth, some amazingly intelligent discussions. It shouldn’t be too amazing, we’re Americans, we think for ourselves. In the military, why are Americans so successful in battle? Initiative, right? They’re given the autonomy to do what has to be done to get the job done. The oath is kind of the same way. When you swore an oath to defend the Constitution, you took upon yourself an individual obligation to make your own decision on the spot about where that line is and whether an order is lawful or unlawful. You have an obligation to do so. As the Nazis found out at Nuremberg, just following orders is no excuse. (0:03:38.9)

SR: You cannot defend yourself, as some American servicemen found out, if you follow an unlawful order, you can and will be prosecuted for it. Does that mean it’s going to be sunshine and flowers and little fluffy Easter bunnies for you? Not necessarily. It could be hard. Michael New paid a price, maybe not so bad as it could have been. It might be that you take a stand that your commanders don’t agree with, but you still have that obligation. You’re kind of on the edge of a sword. You have to choose. But being men of courage who are willing to fight and die in combat, you’re also willing to sacrifice yourself to do what’s right for the Constitution, right? That’s right.

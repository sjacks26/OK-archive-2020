<p>A 92-year-old World War II veteran shot  and killed a suspected robber who attempted to break into his Kentucky  home Monday morning. Two other men believed to be involved in the  botched home invasion are lucky to have escaped with their lives and are  now behind bars, <a href="http://www.wlwt.com/news/local-news/news-northern-kentucky/Boone-County-homeowner-shoots-kills-intruder/-/13608792/16463942/-/item/0/-/euubk3/-/index.html" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.wlwt.com/news/local-news/news-northern-kentucky/Boone-County-homeowner-shoots-kills-intruder/-/13608792/16463942/-/item/0/-/euubk3/-/index.html', 'WLWT reports');" target="_blank">WLWT reports</a>.</p>
<p>According to police, 24-year-old Lloyd  Maxwell broke into the elderly man’s basement after 2 a.m. and tried to  enter the first floor of the home in Verona, Ky. The homeowner,  identified as Earl Jones, said he was startled awake by the noise coming  from his basement and grabbed his .22 caliber rifle and steadied his  aim on the basement door as he heard the sound of footsteps creeping up  the basement stairs.</p>
<p>When the intruder kicked in the door,  Jones fired one fatal shot into Maxwell’s chest, police said. After  firing the single shot, the homeowner called his neighbor, who then  contacted the police.</p>
<p>By the time police arrived, the  burglary suspect had gotten away. However, soon after arriving at Jones’  home, law enforcement in a nearby county received a call about a man  who had been shot close by. Kenton County police responded to the call  and found Maxwell dead inside a 2011 Chevrolet Impala with two other  unharmed men.</p>
<p>The other two men were brought in for  questioning by the Boone County Sheriff’s Office. During the  interrogation, police say both men admitted to being involved in the  bungled burglary at Jones’ home.</p>
<p>Ryan Dalton, 22 and Donnie Inabnit, 20,  both of Dry Ridge, Ky., are charged with second-degree burglary  (complicity) and tampering with physical evidence, WLWT reports.</p>

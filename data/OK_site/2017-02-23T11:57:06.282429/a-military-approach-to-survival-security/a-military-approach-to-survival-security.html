<p>It may seem antiquated, but the primary function of a U.S. Army  soldier has not changed since the inception of the Continental Army. A  soldier always has, and likely always will be, tasked with performing  guard duty in one capacity or another. Perhaps you are wondering what  this has to do with survival security. If a method for securing a  variety of locations as well as various-sized elements has worked so  well for centuries, doesn’t it seem like it would serve a group well  during a survival scenario, regardless of the cause?</p>
<p>Obviously, the amount of technology that is currently available could  provide a great advantage in securing your stronghold. Things like  ground sensors, remotely controlled and monitored security cameras, and  automatically triggered obstacles are outstanding tools. But in most  cases, they are prohibitively expensive. And they also rely on systems  of support like electricity and telecommunications equipment to operate.  Because of these requirements, the guard will, for the foreseeable  future, remain the foundation of a survival security system, whether it  is mobile or stationary.</p>
<p>Army Field Manual 3-21.8 identifies the term guard as having two  different meanings based on the size of the unit. The guard as an  individual is defined as, “the individual responsible to keep watch  over, protect, shield, defend, warn… also referred to as sentinels,  sentries, or lookouts.” A guard, when referencing a unit that is tasked  as a guard force, serves to protect a larger body while “fighting to  gain time while observing and preventing the enemy’s observation and  direct fire against the main body.” It is clear that both of these  definitions could apply to a group that is trying to stay alive and  independent during a difficult scenario.</p>
<p>For the sake of simplicity, we will assume that today we are talking  about maintaining the security of a large group by a shift of guards.  When trying to gain time through observation and simultaneously  preventing enemy observation or action, two approaches are necessary:  stationary guard posts and patrols.</p>
<p>Stationary guard posts can be established almost anywhere. They serve  to identify potential threats and discourage outside forces from  attempting to breach the area which you are protecting. There is not a  requirement to have a guard tower, a bunker or any structure in which to  post the guard. While these locations can provide cover and concealment  for the guard, stationary posts can be located in trees or in a car or  even be a chair on the side of a house.</p>
<p>The important thing to remember is that when securing a sizable area,  it is vital to layer security and have intersecting areas of  observation so as to minimize the possibility of something being missed.  Stationary posts will primarily be observation posts, battle positions,  roadblocks, checkpoints or entry control points.</p>
<p>While it is ideal to have a constant security presence, it may not be  practical for your group. If that is the case, a conscious decision  will have to be made as to when it is possible to have guards posted and  how many there will be. It is probably smarter to maintain a constant  presence of lower numbers of guards than an intermittent presence of  higher numbers. Your situation will dictate. Conduct an assessment of  your needs as well as the highest-risk time frame and develop your plan  from there.</p>
<p>Another factor to consider when determining guard positions is what  will be guarded. If your retreat location includes not just a house but a  barn or other outbuildings, it is likely that multiple structures will  need to be guarded. This could mean additional stationary guards or  implementation of security patrols to encompass the expanded area(s).  During a situation where clean drinking water is difficult to come by, a  guard may need to be posted at your drinking water source to ensure the  security of the site as well as the safety of the water. These are only  a few of the considerations that should be made when setting up your  survival security plan.</p>
<p>Make sure to also include the element of the unknown, if possible,  when making your plan. If the enemy can clearly see how many guards you  have, where they are, when they switch out, etc., it will be much easier  to plan an attack or way around your system of security. Consider the  possibility of varying the number of visible guards and the times when  guards switch out. If you also rotate the locations where each  individual performs his guard duty, it can result in less complacency  and an increased awareness of what is going on around the area.</p>
<p>Don’t rule out the possibility of making some fake guards, using  mannequins that can be placed in windows or other locations to make it  appear as though there are more guards than there actually are. This is  especially practical at night when fewer people may be available anyway.</p>
<p>Security patrols can be conducted on foot, bicycle, boat or truck and  most often serve as an additional layer of security, farther removed  from the primary area being secured. (This is likely practical only  during extreme circumstances and primarily when a crisis is ongoing for a  long period of time.) Patrols can also be used to investigate an area  or probe the enemy to identify strengths and weaknesses.</p>
<p>Do not send a group out on patrol without first identifying each  person’s role in the patrol and conducting rehearsals. A security patrol  can be difficult to conduct and could just lead to people getting lost,  hurt or even killed if proper precautions are not taken.</p>
<p>An effective communications plan should also be in place. And no  patrol should ever leave without an established objective, time of  departure and estimated time of return. Establish specific intervals  and/or locations where the patrol will check in to report their progress  and any issues or concerns. These plans will make it possible to track  the patrol and make it possible to help in the event that additional  resources or assistance are needed.</p>
<p>One of the components of a guard force that has led to the  long-running success of military guard duty is the sergeant of the  guard, a person tasked with making sure that the guards are at their  appointed place(s) of duty, performing their duties. The sergeant of the  guard also ensures that the guards are appropriately relieved when the  time arrives. If the capacity is available in the group, make sure to  identify at least one person per shift who has the leadership capability  and knowledge of guard duties to act as the supervisor for the shift.</p>
<p>Do not overlook the equipment necessary to conduct security  operations, especially the ability to communicate between guards. In an  ideal scenario, each guard would have a radio with extra batteries to  facilitate communication; but this may not be what happens. If radios  and/or batteries are not available, work out a system of animal calls,  hand signals or other means of communication that will allow everyone to  know when things are OK, when there is a problem or even just if  someone needs a break. Other equipment that can be very useful to  stationary guards and patrols include:</p>
<ul>
<li>A map of the area.</li>
<li>A compass and/or GPS.</li>
<li>Binoculars, spotting scope or night vision goggles.</li>
<li>Weapons.</li>
<li>Protective obstacles such as a solid wall.</li>
<li>Early warning devices like trip-wires.</li>
</ul>
<p>As a way to augment a human security force during a survival  situation, physical barriers can be placed or developed around the area  to help decrease the number of eyes that may be needed to secure an  area. Fences, ditches, pits, rocks, walls and the natural terrain are  all examples of physical barriers that can prevent infiltration into an  area. Animals, especially dogs, can also be useful in augmenting a human  security force. The military currently uses canines as the animal  element to a security force. But historically, chickens, goats and even  horses have helped serve as an early warning system to alert when a  possible threat is present.</p>
<p>While there is more to a solid security plan than just placing a few  people around the area you are trying to secure, the human element  cannot be beaten when it comes to reliability, performance and the  ability to adapt to and overcome challenges. The military has been  relying on this model for centuries and has experienced success with it  around the clock and around the world. When it comes to your survival  security, are you willing to take a chance on the unknown? Or would you  rather use something that you know will work, even in the most difficult  of times and circumstances?</p>

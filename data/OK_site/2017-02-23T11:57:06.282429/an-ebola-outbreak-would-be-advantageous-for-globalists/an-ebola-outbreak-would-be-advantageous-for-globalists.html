<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><em>This article was written by Brandon Smith and originally published at <a href="http://www.alt-market.com/articles/2354-an-ebola-outbreak-would-be-advantageous-for-globalists" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.alt-market.com/articles/2354-an-ebola-outbreak-would-be-advantageous-for-globalists', 'Alt-Market.com');">Alt-Market.com</a></em></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">It’s sad to say with such finality, but a  universal fact of existence is that most of the people you meet in this  life are fundamentally and functionally ignorant.  Not necessarily  stupid, but certainly ignorant.  Ignorance comes not from a lack of  intelligence, but from a denial of knowledge and truth.  That is to say,  ignorance takes hold when people decide to act as though they know and  understand a thing, even if they do not.  Ignorance prevails when a  society or nation chooses to value the appearance of expertise, to value  the theater of overconfidence, and to cheer for the bluster of morons  rather than admit that they have unanswered questions on subjects they  do not yet grasp.  For nothing is worse for the self absorbed than to  acknowledge that they do not know.</p>
<p>Entire nations have fallen throughout history because of this terrible weakness…</p>
<p>By extension, such ignorance is not just an inherent disease but also  an easily exploitable disease.  When we refuse to think critically and  examine our surroundings thoroughly, we become like grazing gazelles  oblivious to the predators encircling us in the tall grass.  And, just  as there are predatory individuals that hide amongst us, there are are  also predatory oligarchs that camouflage themselves as benevolent  politicos and financial professionals standing above us.  Normal  predators we fear, establishment predators we invite into our homes as  protectors, saviors, and partners.</p>
<p>The disease of ignorance leaves us vulnerable to many other plagues,  including literal plagues like the Ebola virus.  When we take the  establishment at its word concerning the threat of Ebola outbreak, we  make ourselves vulnerable.  When people assume that the worst could  never happen to them, history shows us that it inevitably does.</p>
<p>The recent discovery of an Ebola infected patient in Dallas, Texas  has led to reasonable concern from the general population, but  mainstream media efforts along with CDC and White House spin have  subdued any practical response by the citizenry.  The constant droning  voice of the establishment claims there is nothing to be worried about;  that even if there was an outbreak in the U.S., it would be quickly  squashed by highly prepared medical response teams.</p>
<p>First and foremost, the existence of just one Ebola infected person  within America’s borders indicates a likelihood of others, or the  possibility of others in the near future unless policies and procedures  are changed.  As far as I can tell, the government has no intention of  introducing rational fail-safes such as requiring mandatory quarantine  for those seeking to reenter the U.S. from known outbreak regions,   shutting down unrestricted travel into the country from countries with  Ebola, training hospitals properly in the identification of the disease,  or committing mass resources to quelling Ebola in hot zones before it  reaches our shores, at least not in time to make a difference.</p>
<p>Secondly, the establishment also has no intention of giving the  general public accurate information as to the behavior and dangers of  Ebola.  Those I have spoken with in the medical field including some who  work within major city hospitals have related to me that the CDC has  not been honest in its assessment of the probability of outbreak.  For  example, the CDC is consistently reminding the public that Ebola is not  an “airborn” disease, and this is technically true as far as the science  indicates.  However, they forget to mention that it is indeed a  “droplet born” disease, meaning, it can travel through the air carried  in an infected cough or sneeze.  The tight quarters of an airplane make  for a perfect petri dish, with droplets and particulates passing back  and forth through the same space and oxygen for hours at a time.  The  spread of Ebola is nowhere near as containable as the CDC claims.</p>
<p>I have been told that most hospitals are completely unprepared to  fend off an outbreak of a virus as destructive as Ebola.  Little to no  standardized training has taken place, and some facilities are only now  putting together a list of emergency procedures.  Human error within the  chain of care also occurs often, as we saw in Dallas, Texas, and these  errors can lead to greater infection in a hospital environment.</p>
<p>CDC and WHO efforts in countries like Liberia have been so  ineffective and halfhearted it leads one to question why their budgets  are in the billions of dollars?  Where is all their capital and their  resources going if not to bring an unprecedented hammer down on a  clearly dangerous outbreak of Ebola?  Why is the virus being allowed to  flourish rather than being destroyed right where it started?  Where has  the full force of the CDC been for the past several months while death  gestates in Africa?</p>
<p>The one legitimate function of government, any government, is to  protect the right of the people to pursue their own life, liberty, and  happiness.  I think stopping the invasion of mortal viruses would fall  into this category.  The one job our government is MANDATED to do, and  it refuses to do it.  Why?</p>
<p>I have made the point many times in the past and I’ll make it here  again; when a catastrophe takes place, or a crisis is imminent, ask  yourself, who ultimately benefits?  I believe that the lack of strong  prevention response from our government, an inadequacy which is obvious  to all of the health care workers I have talked with and to anyone who  has the sense to do their own research, could be absolutely deliberate.   I believe the spread of Ebola may be desired by certain power brokers,  and here is why:</p>
<p><strong>The Perfect Cover Event</strong></p>
<p>I have been warning for quite some time that the banking  establishment in particular is well aware that an economic collapse of  incredible proportions is coming.  In fact, they have done everything in  their power to make one possible.  This collapse, according to my  research, is designed to clear the way through monetary carpet bombing  for a new international Bretton Woods-style agreement which will plant  the foundation of a truly global economic system centralized and  controlled by a highly select few elites.  Needless to say, the  internationalists would prefer not to take the blame for such a  calamity.</p>
<p>Regional or widespread war, terrorism, cyber attacks, etc, are all  useful vehicles to conjure mass confusion, and can also be used as  scapegoats for the eventual downfall of our economy.  That said, a viral  pandemic truly surpasses them all in effectiveness.  All other  tragedies could easily be tied to the first “domino” or “linchpin” (as  Rand Corporation calls it) of Ebola transmission, but the strategy goes  deeper than this…</p>
<p><strong>An Act Of Nature</strong></p>
<p>Even though most people are well aware of the fact that governments  have been engineering biological weapons for decades, few people think  political leadership would ever use them at all, let alone use them on  the people they are tasked to protect.  Even with the complacency and  inaction of our government in terms of the response to Ebola, the  general assumption by most of the American population will be that any  viral outbreak is a product of nature, not of men.</p>
<p>Acts of nature are not things that the common man can easily rebel  against.  People rebel against governments and corrupt despots all the  time, but not the plague.  If a viral pandemic strikes, nearly  everything a government does after the fact, no matter how corrupt or  destructive, can be rationalized as necessary for the greater good of  the greater number.  If anyone does rebel, they will be labeled as pure  evil, for they are now disrupting the government’s ability to stop the  pandemic from spreading, and thus, are partly responsible for the mass  deaths that follow.</p>
<p>During a viral outbreak, government becomes mother, father, nurse and  protector.  No matter how abusive they are, most people will still look  to them for safety and guidance, primarily because they have no  knowledge of disease.  What they do not understand, they will fear, and  fear always drives the ignorant into the arms of tyrants.  One should  also take into consideration the fact that most globalists lean towards  the ideology of eugenics and promote the concept of population  reduction.  A pandemic would fulfill this desire nicely…</p>
<p><strong>Rationalized Economic Collapse</strong></p>
<p>Who would question the event of an economic collapse in the wake of  an Ebola soaked nightmare?  Who would want to buy or sell?  Who would  want to come in contact with strangers to generate a transaction?  Who  would even leave their house?  Ebola treatment in first world nations  has advantages of finance and a cleaner overall health environment, but  what if economic downturn happens simultaneously?  America could  experience third world status very quickly, and with it, all the  unsanitary conditions that result in an exponential Ebola death rate.</p>
<p>The treasury, labor department, and private Federal Reserve have gone  to vast lengths to skew statistics and rig markets with trillions in  fiat dollars.  Despite historic numbers of Americans falling off  unemployment rolls, imploding shipping and manufacturing statistics, and  the U.S. teetering on the edge of global “de-dollarization”, a large  portion of the citizenry has been led to believe that economic recovery  is assured.  What they do not understand is that fiscal implosion is  unavoidable, and the whole bull market is a circus designed to distract.</p>
<p>Amidst even a moderate or controlled viral scenario, stocks and bonds  will undoubtedly crash, a crash that was going to happen anyway.  The  international banks who created the mess get off blameless, while Ebola,  an act of nature, becomes the ultimate scapegoat for every disaster  that follows.</p>
<p><strong>Rationalized Travel Restrictions</strong></p>
<p>If you want to lock down the movement of a population to prevent the  spread of dissenting groups or ideas, I can’t think of a better way than  to claim it is to prevent the spread of a deadly virus.  Our government  and world health officials are approaching Ebola with an attitude of  nonchalance right now, because prevention is NOT part of the plan.  When  Ebola strikes hard within our country, that is when they will finally  decide that strict measures are needed.  Suddenly, those borders that  they could never secure before will become impassable for you and I.   And traveling between states or perhaps even counties may be  extraordinarily difficult.  “Papers please…” will become the new  mantra of petty authority.</p>
<p><strong>Forced Health Measures</strong></p>
<p>Do not be surprised if an Ebola vaccine of some kind suddenly appears  on the market just as the situation begins to turn tragic. And, do not  be surprised if said vaccine is a total sham that ends up making more  people sick.  Expect that forced vaccinations will take place,  especially as a prerequisite for receiving treatment from CDC or FEMA  hazmat facilities.  Expect that these facilities will become nothing  more than obscure prisons for the sick where people quietly die.  Expect  that every American will be required to be tested and screened, with  biometric data carefully stored, beginning with airport travel (once the  virus is already entrenched).   The options are endless for abuse in  terms of totalitarian health laws when the public thinks they could end  up bleeding from every orifice and dying of liver failure.</p>
<p><strong>Rationalized Martial Law </strong></p>
<p>Imagine if some Americans decide they don’t like being poked,  prodded, tagged and bagged by the establishment.  Imagine they decide to  fight back, Ebola be damned.  An already uphill battle becomes an epic  struggle when a large percentage of the population thinks you are a  monster that wants to hasten the spread of Ebola.  Not that the ignorant  count for much in the grand scheme of history, but waking at least some  of them up in the future to the bigger threat (the globalists) is hard  to do when all they can see is devilish microbes.  Those who plan to  combat the rise of the internationalists, as I plan to, should accept  now the likelihood that the only people we will have on our side  tomorrow are the people we have been able to wake up today.  Martial law  will be welcomed by the rest.</p>
<p><strong>International Response</strong></p>
<p>An international response is almost guaranteed during a major  pandemic.  Sovereignty will be tossed in the dirt.  UN and WHO teams and  perhaps even troops could accompany an aid package to the U.S.  Think  of the glorious propaganda, as globalists tell stories of how they  “saved humanity” by surpassing the barbaric practices of national and  individual sovereignty, defeated the Ebola virus (after millions of  deaths, of course), and out of the ashes, the “phoenix” of global  governance was born.  If they succeed, imagine what the history books  will say for the next several centuries.</p>
<p><strong>What Do We Do?</strong></p>
<p>There are no silver bullet solutions.  There never have been and  there never will be.  People looking for them will be sorely  disappointed and ill prepared after wasting so much time searching for  an easy out.  The only answer is for communities of people to take their  own survival into their own hands and become as self sufficient as  possible.  This means that neighborhoods, towns, and counties will have  to take precautions now to steel themselves for a pandemic event,  instead of simply sitting on their hands and expecting government  officials to save them.</p>
<p>The treatments for Ebola in most cases involve nothing more than the  steady replacement of vital fluids, electrolytes and plasma until the  patient’s body can build up an immunity to the virus.  Those with  stronger immune systems before contraction are more likely to survive  and beat back the disease.  Government care, for the most part, is NOT  going to save many people either way.  That is to say, your survival  will depend on you and your immune system, not them.  Communities that  make efforts to prevent contact and that strengthen individual immunity  will have a better chance of survival than going into any government run  hazmat facility.  Government is not needed, and will often end up being  more of a threat than the virus itself.  Groups I work closely with and  talk with, many with their own doctors and nurses, are already setting  prevention guidelines in motion.</p>
<p>If you can prove you don’t need the system to save you, their  rationale for attempting to control you is weakened.  The ignorant will  still try to demonize us for our efforts, but self sufficiency is all we  have in the face of this kind of storm.  If we can lead by example with  our own successful health standards while saving people where the  establishment could not, perhaps we can turn the tide.</p>

<content:encoded>Very nicely said, Cal.<br/>
There is a ton of Federal trash unlawfully posing as “Departments” and “Agencies” and other forms of usurpation which has been promoted and installed into the Federal arena but which is not to be found in Article 1, Section 8. The reason the statists hate Constitutionalists is now clear — statists want to grow the power of government, while the Constitution strictly prohibits everything but those powers listed in Article 1, Section 8, reserving all other powers to the States OR to the People.<br/>
Thank you for another great comment here at Oath Keepers national.<br/>
Salute!<br/>

<content:encoded>I know that I am repeatinig myself a lot, but consider, where in the US Constitution is the FDA, or any other comparable federal agency, is authorized to be created by those that SERVE WITHIN our governments – where is the delegation for these agencies?
<p>We have allowed this to go on.</p>
<p>Basically the insurance mandate, these other mandated restrictions against the people using natural foods, or whatever they want clearly exceeds the federal government’s powers under the interstate commerce clause found in Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution. This is patently obvious when one considers that the power to “regulate” commerce cannot include the power to compel commerce – insurance, health, etc! Those who serve within our general government (federal) claim otherwise simply are ignoring the meaning of the Constitution because they don’t want to limit their power in any way.</p>
<p>The commerce clause was intended simply to give Congress the power to regulate foreign trade, and also to prevent states from imposing tariffs on interstate goods, on the powers that they were delegated, not on anything those that serve within our government desires to control. In Federalist Paper No. 22, Alexander Hamilton makes it clear the simple intent behind the clause was to prevent states from placing tolls or tariffs on goods as they passed through each state – a practice which had proven particularly destructive across the many principalities of the German empire at that time.</p>
<p>Article I, Section 8 giving Congress the power to “provide for the common Defence and general Welfare.”<br/>
The clear legal meaning of the phrase which was borrowed from the Articles of Confederation, meant, and still means, a small subset of duties each individual state considered appropriate to delegate to a separate authority. Roger Sherman, early American lawyer and politician, and a Founding Father of the United States,  moved to have the phrase added to the Constitution, clarifies this (modernly) misunderstood clause. so it could be connected with the clause for laying taxes and duties. Sherman wanted to make it very clear that taxes could only be collected for the enumerated powers, that the “objects of the Union” are “few”; including to list them as “defence against foreign danger,” defense “against internal disputes &amp; a resort to force,” and “regulating foreign commerce &amp; drawing revenue from it” as the specified powers of the general (federal) government. This is consistent with Madison’s words from The Federalist and other sources, and also was the conclusive understanding that the other representatives held in the Philadelphia Convention and the state conventions afterwards.</p>
<p>Madison wrote regarding the General Welfare Clause’s plain meaning when objecting to a 1792 bill which called for subsidized fisheries. The General Welfare Clause was cited as justification to pass such a bill. Madison responded: “I, sir, have always conceived – I believe those who proposed the Constitution conceived, and it is still more fully known, and more material to observe that those who ratified the Constitution conceived –that this is not an indefinite Government, deriving its power from the general terms prefixed to the specified powers, but a limited Government tied down to the specified powers which explain and define the general terms.” He made it clear that the phrase reiterated that the specified powers were tied to “general terms.”</p>
<p>James Madison in a letter written to a Virginia senator, Joseph Cabell, Madison made his views unambiguous: the interstate and foreign commerce clauses were not intended, nor construed, to vest in Congress equivalent powers when regulating domestic and foreign commerce: “I always foresaw difficulties might be started in relation to the interstate commerce power. Being in the same terms with the power over foreign commerce, the same extent, if taken literally, would belong to it. Yet it is very certain it grew out of the abuse of the power of the importing states in taxing the non-importing, and was intended as a negative and preventative provision against injustice amongst the states themselves, rather than as a power to be used for the positive purposes of the General Government, in which alone, however, the remedial power could be lodged. And it will be safer to leave the power with this key to it, than to extend it all the qualities and incidental means belonging to the power over foreign commerce.”</p>
<p>Thomas Jefferson: “Congress has not unlimited powers to provide for the general welfare, but only those specifically enumerated.” </p>
<p>James Madison: “With respect to the words “general welfare,” I have always regarded them as qualified by the detail of powers connected with them. To take them in a literal and unlimited sense would be a metamorphosis of the Constitution into a character which there is a host of proofs was not contemplated by its creators.”</p>
<p>What it comes down to is that those who serve within our governments MUST ALL be replaced because at this time there are NONE who are keeping their Oaths, and actually are committing other crimes also.</p>
<p>They no longer have any LAWFUL authority in any place/position because all the LAWFUL authority is DLEGATED and only exists when they are doing what was delegated to them in writing.  </p>
<p>Dr. Edwin Vieira says it well here: “This has nothing to do with personalities or subjective ideas. It’s a matter of what the Constitution provides…</p>
<p>The government of the United States has never violated anyone’s constitutional rights…<br/>
The government of the United States will never violate anyone constitutional rights, because it cannot violate anyone’s constitutional rights. The reason for that is: The government of the United States is that set of actions by public officials that are consistent with the Constitution. Outside of its constitutional powers, the government of the United States has no legitimacy. It has no authority; and, it really even has no existence. It is what lawyers call a legal fiction.”</p>
<p>Currently we are allowing those who no longer have any lawful authority within our nation to still run our lives. This IS a crime.</p>

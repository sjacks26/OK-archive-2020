<p>This is an interesting article that points out the dangerous absurdity of the “global warming” as “settled science” hoax. The change in terms from “global warming” to “climate change” has done nothing to reverse efforts to reverse the non-existent warming. The opposite is happening; we are in a cooling period. The Government knows this, but keeps the same false, fear-mongering mantra reverberating in our brains.  Why, for instance, is the EPA banning many types of wood-burning stoves? Think about it. – Shorty Dawkins, Associate Editor</p>

<p>By Chris Carrington</p>
<p>Climate change is a way of raising money for governments that just won’t admit they were wrong. It’s a way of taxing us to the point where we can barely afford to put food on the table. It’s a way of instilling fear into children, installing the ‘problems’ in their impressionable minds so that they grow up accepting and not questioning that global warming is an issue.</p>
<p>The change of title from global warming to climate change was subtle. It was a change that was designed to cover all bases. The term global warming signifies just that, that the world is warming. We know it isn’t, it’s cooling. The data bears this out and has done so for the last decade. When the warming stopped back in 1998 it created a problem for our fraudster government, along with all other governments that had bought into the global warming hype. How could they call a problem global warming when the world had actually stopped warming?</p>
<p>For a couple of years there was a hiatus, the Earth stayed roughly where it was, and then the cooling began, and the term climate change came into popular usage, particularly by politicians.</p>
<p>There is nothing wrong with believing the science of the day. Looking back it did indeed appear that the planet was heating up…it was heating up, and it is right that concerns were raised. It’s what happened next that was wrong.</p>
<p>Long standing and well respected scientists pointed out that this happens, the planet goes through cycles of warming and cooling. They pointed out the ‘blip’ in the 1970′s where a cooling trend had hit, and the media was full of headlines proclaiming the next ice age was almost upon us, which obviously was incorrect.</p>
<p>Unlike the arrival of a new ice age, which would cost governments a huge amount of money in the form of having to increase and update power stations to cope with the extra generating capacity required to keep people warm, icebreaker ships to keep key waterways open, extra logistical support to keep roads passable and of course the possibility of relocating citizens if glacial advance became a problem, global warming could be a money maker.</p>
<p>Governments realized almost immediately that they could levy extra taxes on their citizens to raise cash to fight the new threat to mankind. Companies could be made to pay for messing up the atmosphere and increasing greenhouse gases. Global warming, aka climate change, was a huge money spinner.</p>
